        <title>Motivation</title>
        <p>Gene set enrichment methods are a common tool to improve the interpretability of gene lists as obtained, for example, from differential gene expression analyses. They are based on computing whether dysregulated genes are located in certain biological pathways more often than expected by chance. Gene set enrichment tools rely on pre-existing pathway databases such as KEGG, Reactome, or the Gene Ontology. These databases are increasing in size and in the number of redundancies between pathways, which complicates the statistical enrichment computation.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s2">
        <title>Results</title>
        <p>We address this problem and develop a novel gene set enrichment method, called <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic>, which is based on a regularized generalized linear model and directly incorporates dependencies between gene sets related to certain biological functions, for example, due to shared genes, in the enrichment computation. We show that <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> is more robust to noise than competing methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability of our method to recover known pathways as well as to suggest novel treatment targets in an exploratory analysis using breast cancer samples from TCGA.</p>

    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>The behavior of cells is governed by a complex interplay of molecules. Their functional dynamics are organized according to biological pathways (<xref rid="btad522-B11" ref-type="bibr">Chuang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). Perturbations of pathways have been linked to certain diseases, such as cancer (<xref rid="btad522-B28" ref-type="bibr">Hanahan and Weinberg 2000</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B29" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Biological pathways can be obtained from pathway databases such as the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), the Gene Ontology (GO), or Reactome (<xref rid="btad522-B49" ref-type="bibr">Ogata <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 1999</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B22" ref-type="bibr">Gene Ontology Consortium 2004</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B35" ref-type="bibr">Joshi-Tope <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). It is important to note that pathways typically impose a structure of interactions in the form of a network on its contained molecules. While the nodes of this network typically correspond to genes, the edges correspond to interactions, such as signal transductions (<xref rid="btad522-B62" ref-type="bibr">Steffen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). Another way of grouping genes in a meaningful way is to forgo the structure requirement and simply consider, for example, functionally related genes to be part of the same gene set.</p>
    <p>Experiments investigating, for instance, differentially expressed genes between several conditions (e.g. wild-type versus mutant cell cultures) often produce a long list of genes of interest which is difficult to interpret (<xref rid="btad522-B60" ref-type="bibr">Simillion <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2017</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B41" ref-type="bibr">Maleki <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2020</xref>). A common method for aggregating these lists of potentially interesting genes is to assess whether the genes preferentially appear in biologically relevant pathways. This reduces the amount of information which needs to be interpreted from individual genes to groups of genes, i.e. pathways, following a similar function.</p>
    <p>There are several approaches to computing whether certain genes preferentially appear in certain gene sets. They can be roughly divided into three groups: (i) singular enrichment analysis, (ii) gene set enrichment analysis, and (iii) modular enrichment analysis (<xref rid="btad522-B32" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). In a singular enrichment analysis, a list of genes resulting from a differential expression analysis is first partitioned into differentially expressed and not differentially expressed genes based on a threshold typically applied to effect size or <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value. These two groups of genes are then used to compute a pathway enrichment score individually. The gene set enrichment analysis lifts the requirement of a pre-selection of genes and considers all input genes without partitioning them into groups based on a threshold. Finally, the modular enrichment analysis computes the enrichment of each gene set not in isolation but rather by incorporating term–term relations into the statistical model. A term is a set of genes which are all involved in the same biological process and are thus functionally related. These term–term relations represent dependencies between gene sets, which can arise, for example, due to shared genes. This approach has the advantage of not requiring arbitrary thresholds to prepare the input genes and is able to incorporate additional biological knowledge into the enrichment computation by imposing a structure on the gene set database. This additional biological knowledge can help maintain high statistical power in large, redundant gene set databases or structure the final visual presentation of enrichment scores (<xref rid="btad522-B32" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2009</xref>).</p>
    <p>One of the most basic approaches to compute singular enrichments is to use Fisher’s exact test which is based on the hypergeometric distribution and requires a stratification of the input gene set (<xref rid="btad522-B19" ref-type="bibr">Fisher 1922</xref>). There have been many extensions to this initial approach, including threshold-free methods such as the popular tool GSEA (<xref rid="btad522-B63" ref-type="bibr">Subramanian <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2005</xref>) which does not require an a priori stratification of the input and LRPath which formulates the enrichment computation as a regression (<xref rid="btad522-B57" ref-type="bibr">Sartor <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). GSEA has been extended to become more computationally efficient and to be able to approximate small <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values more accurately (<xref rid="btad522-B36" ref-type="bibr">Korotkevich <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2016</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B37" ref-type="bibr">Lachmann <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2022</xref>).</p>
    <p>Various methods have been proposed which follow the modular enrichment approach. topGO (<xref rid="btad522-B1" ref-type="bibr">Alexa <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2006</xref>) is tailored to the tree structure of the gene sets provided by the Gene Ontology resource and removes local dependencies between GO terms which leads to better performance. By relying on the topology of a tree, it is not applicable to many other gene set sources. Another approach is to reduce the number of pathways which are included in the enrichment computation by removing redundant terms based on the notion of semantic similarity (<xref rid="btad522-B75" ref-type="bibr">Yu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2010</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B71" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2021</xref>). RedundancyMiner (<xref rid="btad522-B77" ref-type="bibr">Zeeberg <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2011</xref>) transforms the GO database prior to the enrichment computation by de-replicating redundant GO categories and thus tries to reduce the amount of noise introduced by overlapping pathways appearing in the enrichment analysis.</p>
    <p>These approaches rely on the directed acyclic graph structure of GO terms and cannot be generalized to other pathway databases. GENECODIS (<xref rid="btad522-B9" ref-type="bibr">Carmona-Saez <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2007</xref>) incorporates relations between pathways into the enrichment computation by testing for the enrichment of co-occurring pathways. It can in principle be applied to any pathway database, but it is only available as a web-based tool and can thus not be easily used in automated workflows. The same limitation applies to ProfCom (<xref rid="btad522-B3" ref-type="bibr">Antonov <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2008</xref>) which computes the enrichment of unions, intersections, and differences in pathways. In addition, it uses a greedy heuristic which does not guarantee to find an optimal solution for each case. MGSA (<xref rid="btad522-B6" ref-type="bibr">Bauer <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2010</xref>) embeds all pathways in a Bayesian network and identifies enriched pathways using probabilistic inference. It does, however, not allow to explicitly model pathway relations.</p>
    <p>Finally, tools such as EnrichmentMap (<xref rid="btad522-B45" ref-type="bibr">Merico <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2010</xref>), ClueGO (<xref rid="btad522-B7" ref-type="bibr">Bindea <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2009</xref>), REVIGO (<xref rid="btad522-B65" ref-type="bibr">Supek <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2011</xref>) and GOrilla (<xref rid="btad522-B15" ref-type="bibr">Eden <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2009</xref>) compute a singular enrichment score per pathway and subsequently visualize the result as a network of gene set clusters based on gene overlaps. This approach can be applied to any gene set database but loses statistical power by executing the enrichment analysis and term-term relation inclusion in separate steps. GSEA has also been extended to compute the enrichment of functional gene sets instead of individual genes (<xref rid="btad522-B27" ref-type="bibr">Han <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2019</xref>). However, it is only available as a web-tool and thus not usable for large-scale, automated analyses. It furthermore suffers from long runtimes and the inability to estimate small <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values as it is based on the original GSEA implementation. Other web-based tools which include network-based enrichment methods (<xref rid="btad522-B69" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2017</xref>) can also not be included in automated analyses.</p>
    <p>It has also been shown that combining multiple enrichment methods can improve the robustness and interpretability of the results (<xref rid="btad522-B2" ref-type="bibr">Alhamdoosh <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2017</xref>). As such approaches ultimately rely on well-performing individual tools, developing novel modular enrichment methods is helpful in this context.</p>
    <p>While many methods exist which try to overcome the issue of large redundant pathway databases, none of them, to the best of our knowledge, has accomplished this goal in a simultaneously database-agnostic, flexible, and robust way. By not relying on the hierarchical structure of the Gene Ontology it is possible to create a method which is less restricted and can be used with other pathway databases that are more specialized to the experiment at hand. As there are various approaches to comparing pathways with each other, it is desirable for the enrichment algorithm to not be hard-coded to use a single specific pathway similarity measure but allow different ones based on the needs of the respective research question. The noise inherent to biological experiments leads to measurements of differential gene expression which can deviate from the underlying true differences. Robustness to the level of noise of the input data is thus a crucial property of pathway enrichment methods.</p>
    <p>Here, we introduce a novel method called <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> for computing pathway enrichments which is based on regularized regression. It follows the ideas of GSEA as it requires no stratification of the input gene list, of MGSA as it incorporates term-term relations in a database-agnostic way, and of LRPath as it makes use of the flexibility of the regression approach. By regressing the differential expression <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values of genes on their membership in multiple gene sets while using LASSO and gene set similarity-based regularization terms, we require no prior thresholding and incorporate term-term relations into the enrichment computation. We show in a synthetic benchmark that this model is more robust to noise than competing methods and demonstrate in an application to real data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (<xref rid="btad522-B68" ref-type="bibr">Tomczak <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2015</xref>) that it is able to recover known pathway associations as well as suggest novel ones.</p>

      <title>2.1 Overview</title>
      <p>The input to <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> consists of (i) a list of genes, where each gene is associated with a single <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value obtained from a differential expression experiment and (ii) a gene set database where a gene can be part of multiple gene sets simultaneously. <italic toggle="yes">pareg’</italic>s approach is general enough to support any kind of experimental value associated with the input genes. Pathway enrichments are then computed by regressing the differential expression <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value vector of input genes on a binary matrix indicating gene membership for each gene set in the input database. The estimated coefficient vector captures the degree of association which gene sets have with <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values of differentially expressed genes; it can thus be regarded as an enrichment score. To induce sparsity in the coefficient vector and thus in the selected set of enriched pathways, we use the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regularization term (<xref rid="btad522-B67" ref-type="bibr">Tibshirani 1996</xref>). Term-term relations are included in the model using a network fusion penalty (<xref rid="btad522-B10" ref-type="bibr">Cheng <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2014</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B14" ref-type="bibr">Dirmeier <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2018</xref>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.2 Regression approach</title>
      <p>We use a regularized multiple linear regression model to estimate gene set enrichment scores. Suppose we want to compute the enrichment of <italic toggle="yes">K</italic> pathways using <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> genes. Each gene <italic toggle="yes">g<sub>i</sub></italic> is associated with a <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value <italic toggle="yes">P<sub>i</sub></italic> from a differential expression analysis for <inline-formula id="IE1"><mml:math id="IM1" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>…</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.

      <p>The optimal values for the regularization parameters <italic toggle="yes">λ</italic> (LASSO) and <italic toggle="yes">ψ</italic> (network fusion) are determined using cross-validation (<xref rid="btad522-B14" ref-type="bibr">Dirmeier <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2018</xref>), which balances the effects of the LASSO and network fusion terms. The former term induces a sparse coefficient vector, i.e. it reduces the number of enriched pathways needed to explain the observed data. The latter term promotes assigning a similar enrichment score to (functionally) similar pathways.</p>

    <sec>
      <title>2.3 Pathway similarity measures</title>
      <p>The goal of adding pathway similarities to the model is to group pathways in the enrichment computation. By doing so, redundant sets of functionally related pathways jointly drive the enrichment signal and reduce the influence of noisy measurements. Due to the flexibility of our model, this can be any similarity measure which can be stored as a real matrix.</p>
      <p>As pathways are typically defined as lists of genes, the Jaccard similarity and overlap coefficients are common choices (<xref rid="btad522-B45" ref-type="bibr">Merico <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). They group pathways which share many genes together and are thus a good measure of functional relation (<xref rid="btad522-B4" ref-type="bibr">Bass <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). The overlap coefficient is particularly suited for pathway collections which feature a hierarchical structure.</p>
      <p>In addition, when using the popular Gene Ontology (<xref rid="btad522-B22" ref-type="bibr">Gene Ontology Consortium 2004</xref>) as a pathway database, semantic similarity measures exist. These measures incorporate the topological structure of the Gene Ontology and are better at inferring functional relations between pathways (<xref rid="btad522-B26" ref-type="bibr">Guo <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2006</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B16" ref-type="bibr">Ehsani and Drabløs 2016</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B78" ref-type="bibr">Zhao and Wang 2018</xref>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.4 Presentation of enrichment results</title>
      <p>The estimated coefficient vector <italic toggle="yes">β</italic> can be ordered descendingly by absolute value such that the most dysregulated and thus interesting pathways appear at the top of the list. A regression coefficient <italic toggle="yes">β<sub>j</sub></italic> of large absolute value corresponds to a strong dysregulation of pathway <italic toggle="yes">j</italic>.</p>
      <p>In addition, we implement a network-based visualization of the enrichment result. Each node in this network corresponds to a pathway, and edges correspond to high pathway similarities. The nodes are colored by the respective enrichment score of each pathway. This allows for the quick identification of functional modules as network clusters.</p>
      <p>Finally, the result of <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> can be transformed into a format readily understood by the functional enrichment visualization R package enrichplot (<xref rid="btad522-B74" ref-type="bibr">Yu 2022</xref>). This enables the usage of many plotting functions, such as dot plots, tree plots, and UpSet plots, as well as immediate access to newly implemented ones.</p>

    <sec>
      <title>2.5 Generation of synthetic data</title>
      <p>The goal of the synthetic benchmark is to create a known set of dysregulated pathways which induces a set of differentially expressed genes, apply several enrichment methods (listed below) to this dataset and evaluate how well each method is able to recover the initially dysregulated pathways. Thus, each synthetic dataset consists of a list of genes with associated <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values obtained from a simulated differential expression experiment, as well as a respective ground truth set of pathways.</p>

In order to model the joint activation of functionally related pathways, we apply a similarity sampling approach.

The next term is then drawn according to the probability vector <inline-formula id="IE20"><mml:math id="IM20" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="true">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mo>ρ</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="true">)</mml:mo><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo>ρ</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> where <italic toggle="yes">S<sub>j</sub></italic> is column <italic toggle="yes">j</italic> of <italic toggle="yes">S</italic> and denotes the similarity of term <italic toggle="yes">j</italic> to all other terms, and <italic toggle="yes">U</italic> is a vector of length <inline-formula id="IE21"><mml:math id="IM21" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> with values <inline-formula id="IE22"><mml:math id="IM22" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. This procedure is continued by setting <italic toggle="yes">j</italic> to the previously sampled term and repeated until the required number of terms have been sampled. For <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> close to 1 this results in similar pathways being sampled, while <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> close to 0 leads to a uniformly random sample.</p>
      <p>Next, we model synthetic differential expression <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values for the <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> genes <inline-formula id="IE23"><mml:math id="IM23" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="true">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>…</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="true">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> by sampling from a Beta distribution whose parameters are determined from a linear combination of a noisy gene-term membership matrix and a term activation vector. This mimics the real-life setting where the dysregulation of a pathway is jointly driven by the dysregulated genes it contains.</p>
      <p>In particular, we create the activation vector <inline-formula id="IE24"><mml:math id="IM24" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>β</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="true">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>…</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="true">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> with

      <title>2.6 Performance evaluation in synthetic benchmark</title>
      <p>Due to the strong class imbalance in the experimental setup of pathway enrichments featuring few positives, i.e. dysregulated pathways, compared to the number of negatives, i.e. unaffected pathways, we use precision-recall (PR) curves to evaluate the performance of each pathway enrichment method (<xref rid="btad522-B13" ref-type="bibr">Davis and Goadrich 2006</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B56" ref-type="bibr">Saito and Rehmsmeier 2015</xref>).</p>
      <p>A term <italic toggle="yes">T<sub>j</sub></italic> is classified as a true positive (TP) if it is in <italic toggle="yes">D<sub>A</sub></italic> and is enriched according to a method and respective threshold. It is classified as a false positive (FP) if it is not a member of <italic toggle="yes">D<sub>A</sub></italic> but is estimated to be enriched. Analogously, a true negative (TN) is a term which is not in <italic toggle="yes">D<sub>A</sub></italic> and is not enriched, while a false negative (FN) is a term which is in <italic toggle="yes">D<sub>A</sub></italic> but is not detected by a method. Precision is then defined as <inline-formula id="IE32"><mml:math id="IM32" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="true">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and recall as <inline-formula id="IE33"><mml:math id="IM33" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="true">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.

To obtain a numeric summary of a method’s performance, we compute the area under the precision-recall curve (AUC).</p>

We retrieved 113 tumor and matched normal samples for TCGA-BRCA (Breast Invasive Carcinoma). We then use limma (<xref rid="btad522-B55" ref-type="bibr">Ritchie <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2015</xref>) to run a differential gene expression analysis to compare tumor and normal samples. The obtained <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values and pathways from the biological process subtree of the Gene Ontology are then used as input to <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic>. We use the Jaccard similarity to create a similarity matrix for all considered pathways. As in the synthetic benchmark, we use all pathways with sizes between 50 and 500 in the biological process subtree of the Gene Ontology.</p>

      <p>We compare the performance of <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> to other enrichment tools and versions of itself using a synthetic dataset where the ground truth is known. To do so, we select a set of activated terms and generate differential gene expression <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values using a linear model.</p>
      <p>To demonstrate how the LASSO and network fusion regularization terms contribute toward an improved enrichment result, we compare four versions of <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic>: (i) <italic toggle="yes">pareg_noterms</italic> which employs an objective function without LASSO and network fusion penalties, (ii) <italic toggle="yes">pareg_lasso</italic> which only uses the LASSO term, (iii) <italic toggle="yes">pareg_network</italic> which only uses the network fusion term, and (iv) <italic toggle="yes">pareg_network_lasso</italic> which uses both penalties and is the method used in the other sections. Cross-validation was used in all applicable cases to determine optimal regularization parameters.</p>
      <p>By varying the noise level <italic toggle="yes">η</italic>, we can assess how the two regularization terms contribute toward the model performance (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). For low noise levels (<inline-formula id="IE34"><mml:math id="IM34" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>η</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.25</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), the sparsity induced by the LASSO penalty yields greater performance improvements over the model without any regularization compared to using only the network fusion penalty. For larger levels of noise (<inline-formula id="IE35"><mml:math id="IM35" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>η</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.75</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), the network structure used in the network fusion penalty is able to boost performance more than only the LASSO term. In both cases, the version of <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> which features both regularization terms can make use of each of them to achieve the best performance, demonstrating that both terms are useful and contribute jointly toward good model performance under different circumstances.</p>
      <p>Next, we evaluate the performance of <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> by varying the level of noise <italic toggle="yes">η</italic> used when generating synthetic data in order to simulate different real-life situations where noise can arise from measurement errors, as well as the parameter <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> which controls the degree of clustering of the enriched terms (<xref rid="btad522-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

      </fig>
      <p>In addition to <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic>, we benchmark five other methods. MGSA is a Bayesian approach which embeds pathways in a Bayesian network and explicitly models the activation of sets of pathways (<xref rid="btad522-B6" ref-type="bibr">Bauer <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). It constitutes a modular enrichment method of competitive performance to <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> which does not depend on a particular pathway database. Fisher’s exact test (FET) is a classical single-term enrichment method which is still commonly used and serves as a simple alternative in the comparison (<xref rid="btad522-B19" ref-type="bibr">Fisher 1922</xref>). topGO’s elim algorithm incorporates the GO tree structure into the enrichment computation and is a modular enrichment method which relies on using the Gene Ontology (<xref rid="btad522-B1" ref-type="bibr">Alexa <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). blitzGSEA provides a computationally performant implementation of GSEA which is based on the pre-rank algorithm and constitutes a popular method for computing enrichments (<xref rid="btad522-B37" ref-type="bibr">Lachmann <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2022</xref>). The null model serves as the baseline indicating how random guessing would perform. It assigns a random enrichment <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value between 0 and 1 to each pathway.</p>
      <p>We observe that <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> consistently outperforms all competing methods over a wide range of parameter values (<xref rid="btad522-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). For varying levels of noise <inline-formula id="IE36"><mml:math id="IM36" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>η</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.25</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and similarity factor <inline-formula id="IE37"><mml:math id="IM37" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>ρ</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.5</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> achieves the highest mean areas under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC) in all cases (<xref rid="btad522-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref rid="btad522-F1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> clearly outperforms the singular enrichment methods FET and blitzGSEA, which emphasizes that the proposed method of including term-term relations in the enrichment computation yields an advantage when working with large and redundant pathway databases. Out of all other benchmarked methods, MGSA performs closest to <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> indicating that its Bayesian model-based approach which explicitly handles term-term relations in a database-agnostic way is to some extent able to deal with the clustered pathway database. topGO performs slightly worse than FET. It explicitly uses the GO tree structure and performs successive enrichment tests which are individually similar to FET. This approach is not able to appropriately process the clustering structure assumed in the synthetic benchmark which is not based on a tree.</p>
      <p>When increasing the noise level <italic toggle="yes">η</italic>, we observe that FET, blitzGSEA and topGO show a smaller decrease in performance than <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> and MGSA (<xref rid="btad522-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). This is in line with the observation that the precision of FET, blitzGSEA and topGO remains nearly constant when fixing the recall (<xref rid="btad522-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). For example, at a recall of 80% <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> has a median precision of 94% for <inline-formula id="IE38"><mml:math id="IM38" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>η</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.25</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> while MGSA has a median precision of 37%. FET and topGO have median precision values of 12% and 5% respectively. For <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> and MGSA, most PR-AUC is lost for large values of recall where FET and topGO show poor performance even for small <italic toggle="yes">η</italic>. blitzGSEA behaves similarly to FET in those cases. In terms of runtime, due to the optimization routine and cross-validation scheme used in <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic>, it takes the longest (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). While the other methods run for less than 2 min, <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> takes up to approximately 30 min when run in parallelized mode.</p>
      <p>When increasing the similarity factor <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic>, we see that <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> remains at roughly the same PR-AUC (<xref rid="btad522-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) and only slightly decreases in precision at a fixed recall level (<xref rid="btad522-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>), while MGSA shows a stronger decrease in performance. For example, fixing recall to 80% at <inline-formula id="IE39"><mml:math id="IM39" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>ρ</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> yields a median precision of 94% for <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic>. MGSA, FET, and topGO have median precision values of 29%, 12%, and 5%, respectively. This indicates that <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> is better able to deal with varying levels of clustering in the set of dysregulated pathways. topGO exhibits a slight decline in performance as its tree-based approach is not able to handle the clustering structure induced by the Jaccard similarity measure. As FET and blitzGSEA do not incorporate term-term relations into the enrichment computation, we observe no dependence on <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic>.</p>

      <title>3.2 Exploratory analysis of breast cancer samples</title>
      <p>To investigate the behavior of <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> on real data, we use it to run a pathway enrichment analysis on breast cancer (BRCA) samples from TCGA with terms from the Gene Ontology biological process subtree. We order the terms by their absolute enrichment level and list the top 25 results in (<xref rid="btad522-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) as well as visualize the top 50 non-isolated results in a network (<xref rid="btad522-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>

          <p>Summary of term enrichment results obtained for TCGA breast cancer samples (normal versus tumor) and the biological process subtree of the Gene Ontology. (a) Top 25 terms ordered by absolute enrichment. The <italic toggle="yes">y</italic>-axis lists the terms while the <italic toggle="yes">x</italic>-axis denotes the fraction of significantly differentially expressed genes (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) over the respective term size. The term size is the number of genes making up the term and also represented as the size of each circle. The color of each circle indicates the enrichment of the respective term where blue corresponds to positive and red to negative enrichment. (b) Non-isolated terms of the 50 terms with largest absolute enrichment. Nodes correspond to terms and edges to Jaccard similarities &gt;0.1. The node color and size has the same meaning as in a.

      </fig>
      <p>The largest cluster of the network visualization is made up of 8 nodes and features terms related to cell migration such as ameboidal-type cell migration and actin filament organization. It has been recognized that cancer cells can use amoeboid migration as their preferred migratory strategy (Graziani <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2021). In particular, it has been shown that treatment via endocrine therapy inhibits this kind of migration in breast cancer. Furthermore, it has been shown that the organization of actin stress fibers promote proliferation of pre-invasive breast cancer cells (<xref rid="btad522-B66" ref-type="bibr">Tavares <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2017</xref>). The dysregulation of cell adhesion dynamics has also been investigated in the literature (<xref rid="btad522-B42" ref-type="bibr">Maziveyi and Alahari 2017</xref>) and is captured by the enrichment of cell-substrate adhesion and positive regulation of cell adhesion terms. In addition, the peptidyl-tyrosine modification term is enriched. Tyrosine acts as a key player in the initiation of proteins at focal adhesion sites. Apart from this, the influence of tyrosine phosphatases on many different cancer types (<xref rid="btad522-B47" ref-type="bibr">Motiwala and Jacob 2006</xref>) and of tyrosine kinases specifically on breast cancer (<xref rid="btad522-B8" ref-type="bibr">Biscardi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2000</xref>) has been recognized.</p>
      <p>The second-largest cluster made up of seven nodes is thematically related to DNA replication and conformational changes. These processes are of high relevance to cancers in general (<xref rid="btad522-B33" ref-type="bibr">Jia <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2017</xref>) as well as breast cancer specifically (<xref rid="btad522-B23" ref-type="bibr">Ghimire <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2020</xref>). Furthermore, the importance of double-strand break repair has been captured by the enrichment of the corresponding term (<xref rid="btad522-B5" ref-type="bibr">Bau <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>A few smaller clusters remain. One cluster of three nodes contains the terms chromosome segregation, non-membrane-bounded organelle assembly, and striated muscle cell differentiation. The importance of chromosomal stability and the impact of proteins which modulate it have been highlighted for breast cancer (<xref rid="btad522-B20" ref-type="bibr">Garcia and Lizcano 2016</xref>). Furthermore, it has been observed that breast cancer cells exhibit non-random chromosome segregation (<xref rid="btad522-B40" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). In addition, striated muscle cell differentiation has been linked to the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells (<xref rid="btad522-B48" ref-type="bibr">Nikulin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2021</xref>). Another cluster of three nodes contains the terms cilium movement, cilium or flagellum-dependent cell motility, and axoneme assembly. It has been shown that the expression of cilia is downregulated in various types of cancer, including breast cancer (<xref rid="btad522-B31" ref-type="bibr">Higgins <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2019</xref>). It furthermore has impact on the regulation of cancer development (<xref rid="btad522-B17" ref-type="bibr">Fabbri <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2019</xref>). The related enrichment of the axoneme assembly terms suggests the importance of the assembly and organization of an axoneme. This constitutes a novel finding and suggests further experimental investigations. The last cluster with three nodes contains the terms T-cell receptor signaling pathway, antigen receptor-mediated signaling pathway, and immune response-regulating cell surface receptor signaling pathway. Both the relevance of the T-cell receptor signaling (<xref rid="btad522-B59" ref-type="bibr">Shah <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2021</xref>) and immune response-regulating cell surface receptor signaling term (<xref rid="btad522-B54" ref-type="bibr">Rezaei-Tavirani <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2019</xref>) have been recognized. The possibility of investigating the antigen receptor-mediated signaling pathway for a Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy has very recently been considered (<xref rid="btad522-B73" ref-type="bibr">Yang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2022</xref>). Finally, the two-node cluster contains the terms translational initiation and regulation of translational initiation. The regulation of translation via changed expression of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 has been observed to play a positive role in breast cancer progression (<xref rid="btad522-B25" ref-type="bibr">Grzmil <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>In addition to the network clusters, we also detect individually enriched pathways (<xref rid="btad522-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). We find the retrograde vesicle-mediated transport, Golgi to endoplasmic reticulum term to be enriched. The potential implications of this apparatus have already been discussed (<xref rid="btad522-B61" ref-type="bibr">Spang 2013</xref>), but have, to the best of our knowledge, not been linked to breast cancer specifically. The synaptic vesicle recycling term is also enriched. Its potential as a therapeutic target has been recognized (<xref rid="btad522-B38" ref-type="bibr">Li and Kavalali 2017</xref>), however not in the context of breast cancer. In both cases, our results suggest the novel finding that these pathways may be especially relevant to breast cancer and that further experimental validations in that direction would be interesting.</p>
      <p>We also demonstrate the effectiveness of network regularization by comparing the enrichments to results obtained from running <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> without the network regularization term (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S9</xref>) and from FET (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S10</xref>). In both cases, much fewer clusters are observed, making the biological interpretation more difficult. This indicates that employing the network regularization term is useful for a better understanding of the enrichment results.</p>

    <title>4 Discussion</title>
    <p>We have developed a novel pathway enrichment method called <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> which is based on a regularized generalized linear model. It makes use of LASSO and network fusion penalty terms to produce a sparse and coherent list of enriched pathways. The network fusion term incorporates a pathway similarity network which models functional relations between pathways and clusters pathways as part of the enrichment computation in order to handle large and redundant pathway databases.</p>
    <p>In a synthetic benchmark, we show that <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> is able to outperform single-term enrichment methods such as Fisher’s exact test, a popular tool explicitly including the GO tree in its calculations as well as a model-based approach which embeds pathways in a Bayesian network.</p>
    <p>In an exploratory analysis with breast cancer samples, we were able to recover many relevant pathways already known in the literature, as well as suggest novel ones which pose interesting future targets for experimental validation.</p>
    <p>We note that <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> assumes that a linear combination of gene-pathway memberships is driving the overall pathway dysregulation, an assumption which may reduce the algorithm’s applicability in certain biological environments, such as the interactions between genes in myocardial infarction as measured by mRNA expression profiles (<xref rid="btad522-B30" ref-type="bibr">Hartmann <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2016</xref>).</p>
    <p>Due to the flexibility of the regression approach, potential future work could go in many directions. Instead of modeling the response variable using a Beta distribution, one may use a beta-uniform mixture which has been suggested for <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values (<xref rid="btad522-B51" ref-type="bibr">Pounds and Morris 2003</xref>). It is also possible to binarize the differential gene expression <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values (similarly to how it would have to be done for Fisher’s exact test, a classical enrichment method) into dysregulated and unaffected genes by applying a threshold. The response could then, for example, be modelled using a Bernoulli distribution. This could reduce noisy <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value estimation effects but requires the selection of another hyperparameter (the binarization threshold). As the network fusion penalty depends on a general similarity matrix, different measures could be explored. For example, there exist a wide range of different semantic similarity measures which have been used to relate GO terms (<xref rid="btad522-B34" ref-type="bibr">Jiang and Conrath 1997</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B39" ref-type="bibr">Lin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 1998</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B53" ref-type="bibr">Resnik 1999</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B58" ref-type="bibr">Schlicker <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2006</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B70" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2007</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B78" ref-type="bibr">Zhao and Wang 2018</xref>). Alternatively, similarity measures which embed sets of genes in protein-protein interaction networks and compare their localization have been shown to be useful for predicting disease status; they could be another viable choice (<xref rid="btad522-B4" ref-type="bibr">Bass <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2013</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B44" ref-type="bibr">Menche <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2015</xref>).</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the potential effects of other regularization terms are interesting. Using an Elastic-Net term instead of LASSO or stability selection (<xref rid="btad522-B43" ref-type="bibr">Meinshausen and Bühlmann 2010</xref>) could improve the sparsity of the coefficient vector. Instead of the network fusion term, regularizations such as hierarchical feature regression (<xref rid="btad522-B50" ref-type="bibr">Pfitzinger 2021</xref>), regularized k-means clustering (<xref rid="btad522-B64" ref-type="bibr">Sun <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2012</xref>) or group LASSO (<xref rid="btad522-B76" ref-type="bibr">Yuan and Lin 2006</xref>) can be used to incorporate term-term relations and may exhibit more desirable statistical properties, such as stronger robustness to noise, smaller sample size requirements and faster convergence of the optimizer. Due to these regularization terms, it is not immediately possible to compute confidence intervals for each entry of the estimated coefficient vector. The de-biased LASSO approach (<xref rid="btad522-B72" ref-type="bibr">Xia <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2020</xref>) can be explored to get a better understanding of the uncertainty involved in the enrichment computation.</p>
    <p>Finally, while there have been programming language specific efforts to standardize gene set enrichment benchmarking workflows (<xref rid="btad522-B21" ref-type="bibr">Geistlinger <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2021</xref>), no widely accepted consensus has been found. The benchmarking workflow we implement is written in the workflow management system Snakemake (<xref rid="btad522-B46" ref-type="bibr">Mölder <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2021</xref>) and thus allows easy integration of additional tools as well as reproducible execution on different back ends. We thus hope that other enrichment tools can use a similar approach to enable comparative benchmarks of new methodologies.</p>

        <title>Motivation</title>
        <p>Gene set enrichment methods are a common tool to improve the interpretability of gene lists as obtained, for example, from differential gene expression analyses. They are based on computing whether dysregulated genes are located in certain biological pathways more often than expected by chance. Gene set enrichment tools rely on pre-existing pathway databases such as KEGG, Reactome, or the Gene Ontology. These databases are increasing in size and in the number of redundancies between pathways, which complicates the statistical enrichment computation.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s2">
        <title>Results</title>
        <p>We address this problem and develop a novel gene set enrichment method, called <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic>, which is based on a regularized generalized linear model and directly incorporates dependencies between gene sets related to certain biological functions, for example, due to shared genes, in the enrichment computation. We show that <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> is more robust to noise than competing methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability of our method to recover known pathways as well as to suggest novel treatment targets in an exploratory analysis using breast cancer samples from TCGA.</p>

    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>The behavior of cells is governed by a complex interplay of molecules. Their functional dynamics are organized according to biological pathways (<xref rid="btad522-B11" ref-type="bibr">Chuang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). Perturbations of pathways have been linked to certain diseases, such as cancer (<xref rid="btad522-B28" ref-type="bibr">Hanahan and Weinberg 2000</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B29" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Biological pathways can be obtained from pathway databases such as the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), the Gene Ontology (GO), or Reactome (<xref rid="btad522-B49" ref-type="bibr">Ogata <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 1999</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B22" ref-type="bibr">Gene Ontology Consortium 2004</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B35" ref-type="bibr">Joshi-Tope <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). It is important to note that pathways typically impose a structure of interactions in the form of a network on its contained molecules. While the nodes of this network typically correspond to genes, the edges correspond to interactions, such as signal transductions (<xref rid="btad522-B62" ref-type="bibr">Steffen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). Another way of grouping genes in a meaningful way is to forgo the structure requirement and simply consider, for example, functionally related genes to be part of the same gene set.</p>
    <p>Experiments investigating, for instance, differentially expressed genes between several conditions (e.g. wild-type versus mutant cell cultures) often produce a long list of genes of interest which is difficult to interpret (<xref rid="btad522-B60" ref-type="bibr">Simillion <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2017</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B41" ref-type="bibr">Maleki <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2020</xref>). A common method for aggregating these lists of potentially interesting genes is to assess whether the genes preferentially appear in biologically relevant pathways. This reduces the amount of information which needs to be interpreted from individual genes to groups of genes, i.e. pathways, following a similar function.</p>
    <p>There are several approaches to computing whether certain genes preferentially appear in certain gene sets. They can be roughly divided into three groups: (i) singular enrichment analysis, (ii) gene set enrichment analysis, and (iii) modular enrichment analysis (<xref rid="btad522-B32" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). In a singular enrichment analysis, a list of genes resulting from a differential expression analysis is first partitioned into differentially expressed and not differentially expressed genes based on a threshold typically applied to effect size or <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value. These two groups of genes are then used to compute a pathway enrichment score individually. The gene set enrichment analysis lifts the requirement of a pre-selection of genes and considers all input genes without partitioning them into groups based on a threshold. Finally, the modular enrichment analysis computes the enrichment of each gene set not in isolation but rather by incorporating term–term relations into the statistical model. A term is a set of genes which are all involved in the same biological process and are thus functionally related. These term–term relations represent dependencies between gene sets, which can arise, for example, due to shared genes. This approach has the advantage of not requiring arbitrary thresholds to prepare the input genes and is able to incorporate additional biological knowledge into the enrichment computation by imposing a structure on the gene set database. This additional biological knowledge can help maintain high statistical power in large, redundant gene set databases or structure the final visual presentation of enrichment scores (<xref rid="btad522-B32" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2009</xref>).</p>
    <p>One of the most basic approaches to compute singular enrichments is to use Fisher’s exact test which is based on the hypergeometric distribution and requires a stratification of the input gene set (<xref rid="btad522-B19" ref-type="bibr">Fisher 1922</xref>). There have been many extensions to this initial approach, including threshold-free methods such as the popular tool GSEA (<xref rid="btad522-B63" ref-type="bibr">Subramanian <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2005</xref>) which does not require an a priori stratification of the input and LRPath which formulates the enrichment computation as a regression (<xref rid="btad522-B57" ref-type="bibr">Sartor <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). GSEA has been extended to become more computationally efficient and to be able to approximate small <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values more accurately (<xref rid="btad522-B36" ref-type="bibr">Korotkevich <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2016</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B37" ref-type="bibr">Lachmann <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2022</xref>).</p>
    <p>Various methods have been proposed which follow the modular enrichment approach. topGO (<xref rid="btad522-B1" ref-type="bibr">Alexa <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2006</xref>) is tailored to the tree structure of the gene sets provided by the Gene Ontology resource and removes local dependencies between GO terms which leads to better performance. By relying on the topology of a tree, it is not applicable to many other gene set sources. Another approach is to reduce the number of pathways which are included in the enrichment computation by removing redundant terms based on the notion of semantic similarity (<xref rid="btad522-B75" ref-type="bibr">Yu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2010</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B71" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2021</xref>). RedundancyMiner (<xref rid="btad522-B77" ref-type="bibr">Zeeberg <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2011</xref>) transforms the GO database prior to the enrichment computation by de-replicating redundant GO categories and thus tries to reduce the amount of noise introduced by overlapping pathways appearing in the enrichment analysis.</p>
    <p>These approaches rely on the directed acyclic graph structure of GO terms and cannot be generalized to other pathway databases. GENECODIS (<xref rid="btad522-B9" ref-type="bibr">Carmona-Saez <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2007</xref>) incorporates relations between pathways into the enrichment computation by testing for the enrichment of co-occurring pathways. It can in principle be applied to any pathway database, but it is only available as a web-based tool and can thus not be easily used in automated workflows. The same limitation applies to ProfCom (<xref rid="btad522-B3" ref-type="bibr">Antonov <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2008</xref>) which computes the enrichment of unions, intersections, and differences in pathways. In addition, it uses a greedy heuristic which does not guarantee to find an optimal solution for each case. MGSA (<xref rid="btad522-B6" ref-type="bibr">Bauer <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2010</xref>) embeds all pathways in a Bayesian network and identifies enriched pathways using probabilistic inference. It does, however, not allow to explicitly model pathway relations.</p>
    <p>Finally, tools such as EnrichmentMap (<xref rid="btad522-B45" ref-type="bibr">Merico <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2010</xref>), ClueGO (<xref rid="btad522-B7" ref-type="bibr">Bindea <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2009</xref>), REVIGO (<xref rid="btad522-B65" ref-type="bibr">Supek <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2011</xref>) and GOrilla (<xref rid="btad522-B15" ref-type="bibr">Eden <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2009</xref>) compute a singular enrichment score per pathway and subsequently visualize the result as a network of gene set clusters based on gene overlaps. This approach can be applied to any gene set database but loses statistical power by executing the enrichment analysis and term-term relation inclusion in separate steps. GSEA has also been extended to compute the enrichment of functional gene sets instead of individual genes (<xref rid="btad522-B27" ref-type="bibr">Han <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2019</xref>). However, it is only available as a web-tool and thus not usable for large-scale, automated analyses. It furthermore suffers from long runtimes and the inability to estimate small <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values as it is based on the original GSEA implementation. Other web-based tools which include network-based enrichment methods (<xref rid="btad522-B69" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2017</xref>) can also not be included in automated analyses.</p>
    <p>It has also been shown that combining multiple enrichment methods can improve the robustness and interpretability of the results (<xref rid="btad522-B2" ref-type="bibr">Alhamdoosh <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2017</xref>). As such approaches ultimately rely on well-performing individual tools, developing novel modular enrichment methods is helpful in this context.</p>
    <p>While many methods exist which try to overcome the issue of large redundant pathway databases, none of them, to the best of our knowledge, has accomplished this goal in a simultaneously database-agnostic, flexible, and robust way. By not relying on the hierarchical structure of the Gene Ontology it is possible to create a method which is less restricted and can be used with other pathway databases that are more specialized to the experiment at hand. As there are various approaches to comparing pathways with each other, it is desirable for the enrichment algorithm to not be hard-coded to use a single specific pathway similarity measure but allow different ones based on the needs of the respective research question. The noise inherent to biological experiments leads to measurements of differential gene expression which can deviate from the underlying true differences. Robustness to the level of noise of the input data is thus a crucial property of pathway enrichment methods.</p>
    <p>Here, we introduce a novel method called <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> for computing pathway enrichments which is based on regularized regression. It follows the ideas of GSEA as it requires no stratification of the input gene list, of MGSA as it incorporates term-term relations in a database-agnostic way, and of LRPath as it makes use of the flexibility of the regression approach. By regressing the differential expression <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values of genes on their membership in multiple gene sets while using LASSO and gene set similarity-based regularization terms, we require no prior thresholding and incorporate term-term relations into the enrichment computation. We show in a synthetic benchmark that this model is more robust to noise than competing methods and demonstrate in an application to real data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (<xref rid="btad522-B68" ref-type="bibr">Tomczak <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2015</xref>) that it is able to recover known pathway associations as well as suggest novel ones.</p>

    <sec>
      <title>2.1 Overview</title>
      <p>The input to <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> consists of (i) a list of genes, where each gene is associated with a single <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value obtained from a differential expression experiment and (ii) a gene set database where a gene can be part of multiple gene sets simultaneously. <italic toggle="yes">pareg’</italic>s approach is general enough to support any kind of experimental value associated with the input genes. Pathway enrichments are then computed by regressing the differential expression <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value vector of input genes on a binary matrix indicating gene membership for each gene set in the input database. The estimated coefficient vector captures the degree of association which gene sets have with <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values of differentially expressed genes; it can thus be regarded as an enrichment score. To induce sparsity in the coefficient vector and thus in the selected set of enriched pathways, we use the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regularization term (<xref rid="btad522-B67" ref-type="bibr">Tibshirani 1996</xref>). Term-term relations are included in the model using a network fusion penalty (<xref rid="btad522-B10" ref-type="bibr">Cheng <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2014</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B14" ref-type="bibr">Dirmeier <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2018</xref>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.2 Regression approach</title>
      <p>We use a regularized multiple linear regression model to estimate gene set enrichment scores. Suppose we want to compute the enrichment of <italic toggle="yes">K</italic> pathways using <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> genes. Each gene <italic toggle="yes">g<sub>i</sub></italic> is associated with a <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value <italic toggle="yes">P<sub>i</sub></italic> from a differential expression analysis for <inline-formula id="IE1"><mml:math id="IM1" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>…</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.

      <p>The optimal values for the regularization parameters <italic toggle="yes">λ</italic> (LASSO) and <italic toggle="yes">ψ</italic> (network fusion) are determined using cross-validation (<xref rid="btad522-B14" ref-type="bibr">Dirmeier <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2018</xref>), which balances the effects of the LASSO and network fusion terms. The former term induces a sparse coefficient vector, i.e. it reduces the number of enriched pathways needed to explain the observed data. The latter term promotes assigning a similar enrichment score to (functionally) similar pathways.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.3 Pathway similarity measures</title>
      <p>The goal of adding pathway similarities to the model is to group pathways in the enrichment computation. By doing so, redundant sets of functionally related pathways jointly drive the enrichment signal and reduce the influence of noisy measurements. Due to the flexibility of our model, this can be any similarity measure which can be stored as a real matrix.</p>
      <p>As pathways are typically defined as lists of genes, the Jaccard similarity and overlap coefficients are common choices (<xref rid="btad522-B45" ref-type="bibr">Merico <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). They group pathways which share many genes together and are thus a good measure of functional relation (<xref rid="btad522-B4" ref-type="bibr">Bass <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). The overlap coefficient is particularly suited for pathway collections which feature a hierarchical structure.</p>
      <p>In addition, when using the popular Gene Ontology (<xref rid="btad522-B22" ref-type="bibr">Gene Ontology Consortium 2004</xref>) as a pathway database, semantic similarity measures exist. These measures incorporate the topological structure of the Gene Ontology and are better at inferring functional relations between pathways (<xref rid="btad522-B26" ref-type="bibr">Guo <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2006</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B16" ref-type="bibr">Ehsani and Drabløs 2016</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B78" ref-type="bibr">Zhao and Wang 2018</xref>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.4 Presentation of enrichment results</title>
      <p>The estimated coefficient vector <italic toggle="yes">β</italic> can be ordered descendingly by absolute value such that the most dysregulated and thus interesting pathways appear at the top of the list. A regression coefficient <italic toggle="yes">β<sub>j</sub></italic> of large absolute value corresponds to a strong dysregulation of pathway <italic toggle="yes">j</italic>.</p>
      <p>In addition, we implement a network-based visualization of the enrichment result. Each node in this network corresponds to a pathway, and edges correspond to high pathway similarities. The nodes are colored by the respective enrichment score of each pathway. This allows for the quick identification of functional modules as network clusters.</p>
      <p>Finally, the result of <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> can be transformed into a format readily understood by the functional enrichment visualization R package enrichplot (<xref rid="btad522-B74" ref-type="bibr">Yu 2022</xref>). This enables the usage of many plotting functions, such as dot plots, tree plots, and UpSet plots, as well as immediate access to newly implemented ones.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.5 Generation of synthetic data</title>
      <p>The goal of the synthetic benchmark is to create a known set of dysregulated pathways which induces a set of differentially expressed genes, apply several enrichment methods (listed below) to this dataset and evaluate how well each method is able to recover the initially dysregulated pathways. Thus, each synthetic dataset consists of a list of genes with associated <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values obtained from a simulated differential expression experiment, as well as a respective ground truth set of pathways.</p>

In order to model the joint activation of functionally related pathways, we apply a similarity sampling approach.

The next term is then drawn according to the probability vector <inline-formula id="IE20"><mml:math id="IM20" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="true">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mo>ρ</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="true">)</mml:mo><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo>ρ</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> where <italic toggle="yes">S<sub>j</sub></italic> is column <italic toggle="yes">j</italic> of <italic toggle="yes">S</italic> and denotes the similarity of term <italic toggle="yes">j</italic> to all other terms, and <italic toggle="yes">U</italic> is a vector of length <inline-formula id="IE21"><mml:math id="IM21" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> with values <inline-formula id="IE22"><mml:math id="IM22" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. This procedure is continued by setting <italic toggle="yes">j</italic> to the previously sampled term and repeated until the required number of terms have been sampled. For <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> close to 1 this results in similar pathways being sampled, while <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> close to 0 leads to a uniformly random sample.</p>
      <p>Next, we model synthetic differential expression <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values for the <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> genes <inline-formula id="IE23"><mml:math id="IM23" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="true">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>…</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="true">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> by sampling from a Beta distribution whose parameters are determined from a linear combination of a noisy gene-term membership matrix and a term activation vector. This mimics the real-life setting where the dysregulation of a pathway is jointly driven by the dysregulated genes it contains.</p>
      <p>In particular, we create the activation vector <inline-formula id="IE24"><mml:math id="IM24" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>β</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="true">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>…</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="true">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> with

      <title>2.6 Performance evaluation in synthetic benchmark</title>
      <p>Due to the strong class imbalance in the experimental setup of pathway enrichments featuring few positives, i.e. dysregulated pathways, compared to the number of negatives, i.e. unaffected pathways, we use precision-recall (PR) curves to evaluate the performance of each pathway enrichment method (<xref rid="btad522-B13" ref-type="bibr">Davis and Goadrich 2006</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B56" ref-type="bibr">Saito and Rehmsmeier 2015</xref>).</p>
      <p>A term <italic toggle="yes">T<sub>j</sub></italic> is classified as a true positive (TP) if it is in <italic toggle="yes">D<sub>A</sub></italic> and is enriched according to a method and respective threshold. It is classified as a false positive (FP) if it is not a member of <italic toggle="yes">D<sub>A</sub></italic> but is estimated to be enriched. Analogously, a true negative (TN) is a term which is not in <italic toggle="yes">D<sub>A</sub></italic> and is not enriched, while a false negative (FN) is a term which is in <italic toggle="yes">D<sub>A</sub></italic> but is not detected by a method.

      <p>We conduct an exploratory analysis using cancer and normal samples from processed TCGA data available in the Gene Expression Omnibus entry GSE62944 (<xref rid="btad522-B52" ref-type="bibr">Rahman <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). We retrieved 113 tumor and matched normal samples for TCGA-BRCA (Breast Invasive Carcinoma). We then use limma (<xref rid="btad522-B55" ref-type="bibr">Ritchie <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2015</xref>) to run a differential gene expression analysis to compare tumor and normal samples. The obtained <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values and pathways from the biological process subtree of the Gene Ontology are then used as input to <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic>. We use the Jaccard similarity to create a similarity matrix for all considered pathways. As in the synthetic benchmark, we use all pathways with sizes between 50 and 500 in the biological process subtree of the Gene Ontology.</p>

    <title>3 Results</title>
    <p>First, we demonstrate the effect of the regularization terms used in the objective function and compare the performance of <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> to competing methods using a synthetic benchmark study. Second, we conduct an exploratory analysis using a breast cancer dataset from TCGA.</p>
    <sec>
      <title>3.1 Synthetic benchmark</title>
      <p>We compare the performance of <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> to other enrichment tools and versions of itself using a synthetic dataset where the ground truth is known. To do so, we select a set of activated terms and generate differential gene expression <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values using a linear model.</p>
      <p>To demonstrate how the LASSO and network fusion regularization terms contribute toward an improved enrichment result, we compare four versions of <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic>: (i) <italic toggle="yes">pareg_noterms</italic> which employs an objective function without LASSO and network fusion penalties, (ii) <italic toggle="yes">pareg_lasso</italic> which only uses the LASSO term, (iii) <italic toggle="yes">pareg_network</italic> which only uses the network fusion term, and (iv) <italic toggle="yes">pareg_network_lasso</italic> which uses both penalties and is the method used in the other sections. Cross-validation was used in all applicable cases to determine optimal regularization parameters.</p>
      <p>By varying the noise level <italic toggle="yes">η</italic>, we can assess how the two regularization terms contribute toward the model performance (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). For low noise levels (<inline-formula id="IE34"><mml:math id="IM34" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>η</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.25</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), the sparsity induced by the LASSO penalty yields greater performance improvements over the model without any regularization compared to using only the network fusion penalty. For larger levels of noise (<inline-formula id="IE35"><mml:math id="IM35" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>η</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.75</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), the network structure used in the network fusion penalty is able to boost performance more than only the LASSO term. In both cases, the version of <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> which features both regularization terms can make use of each of them to achieve the best performance, demonstrating that both terms are useful and contribute jointly toward good model performance under different circumstances.</p>
      <p>Next, we evaluate the performance of <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> by varying the level of noise <italic toggle="yes">η</italic> used when generating synthetic data in order to simulate different real-life situations where noise can arise from measurement errors, as well as the parameter <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> which controls the degree of clustering of the enriched terms (<xref rid="btad522-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

      </fig>
      <p>In addition to <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic>, we benchmark five other methods. MGSA is a Bayesian approach which embeds pathways in a Bayesian network and explicitly models the activation of sets of pathways (<xref rid="btad522-B6" ref-type="bibr">Bauer <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). It constitutes a modular enrichment method of competitive performance to <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> which does not depend on a particular pathway database. Fisher’s exact test (FET) is a classical single-term enrichment method which is still commonly used and serves as a simple alternative in the comparison (<xref rid="btad522-B19" ref-type="bibr">Fisher 1922</xref>). topGO’s elim algorithm incorporates the GO tree structure into the enrichment computation and is a modular enrichment method which relies on using the Gene Ontology (<xref rid="btad522-B1" ref-type="bibr">Alexa <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). blitzGSEA provides a computationally performant implementation of GSEA which is based on the pre-rank algorithm and constitutes a popular method for computing enrichments (<xref rid="btad522-B37" ref-type="bibr">Lachmann <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2022</xref>). The null model serves as the baseline indicating how random guessing would perform. It assigns a random enrichment <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value between 0 and 1 to each pathway.</p>
      <p>We observe that <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> consistently outperforms all competing methods over a wide range of parameter values (<xref rid="btad522-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). For varying levels of noise <inline-formula id="IE36"><mml:math id="IM36" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>η</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.25</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and similarity factor <inline-formula id="IE37"><mml:math id="IM37" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>ρ</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.5</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> achieves the highest mean areas under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC) in all cases (<xref rid="btad522-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref rid="btad522-F1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> clearly outperforms the singular enrichment methods FET and blitzGSEA, which emphasizes that the proposed method of including term-term relations in the enrichment computation yields an advantage when working with large and redundant pathway databases. Out of all other benchmarked methods, MGSA performs closest to <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> indicating that its Bayesian model-based approach which explicitly handles term-term relations in a database-agnostic way is to some extent able to deal with the clustered pathway database. topGO performs slightly worse than FET. It explicitly uses the GO tree structure and performs successive enrichment tests which are individually similar to FET. This approach is not able to appropriately process the clustering structure assumed in the synthetic benchmark which is not based on a tree.</p>
      <p>When increasing the noise level <italic toggle="yes">η</italic>, we observe that FET, blitzGSEA and topGO show a smaller decrease in performance than <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> and MGSA (<xref rid="btad522-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). This is in line with the observation that the precision of FET, blitzGSEA and topGO remains nearly constant when fixing the recall (<xref rid="btad522-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). For example, at a recall of 80% <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> has a median precision of 94% for <inline-formula id="IE38"><mml:math id="IM38" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>η</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.25</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> while MGSA has a median precision of 37%. FET and topGO have median precision values of 12% and 5% respectively. For <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> and MGSA, most PR-AUC is lost for large values of recall where FET and topGO show poor performance even for small <italic toggle="yes">η</italic>. blitzGSEA behaves similarly to FET in those cases. In terms of runtime, due to the optimization routine and cross-validation scheme used in <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic>, it takes the longest (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). While the other methods run for less than 2 min, <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> takes up to approximately 30 min when run in parallelized mode.</p>
      <p>When increasing the similarity factor <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic>, we see that <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> remains at roughly the same PR-AUC (<xref rid="btad522-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) and only slightly decreases in precision at a fixed recall level (<xref rid="btad522-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>), while MGSA shows a stronger decrease in performance. For example, fixing recall to 80% at <inline-formula id="IE39"><mml:math id="IM39" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>ρ</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> yields a median precision of 94% for <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic>. MGSA, FET, and topGO have median precision values of 29%, 12%, and 5%, respectively. This indicates that <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> is better able to deal with varying levels of clustering in the set of dysregulated pathways. topGO exhibits a slight decline in performance as its tree-based approach is not able to handle the clustering structure induced by the Jaccard similarity measure. As FET and blitzGSEA do not incorporate term-term relations into the enrichment computation, we observe no dependence on <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic>.</p>

      <title>3.2 Exploratory analysis of breast cancer samples</title>
      <p>To investigate the behavior of <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> on real data, we use it to run a pathway enrichment analysis on breast cancer (BRCA) samples from TCGA with terms from the Gene Ontology biological process subtree. We order the terms by their absolute enrichment level and list the top 25 results in (<xref rid="btad522-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) as well as visualize the top 50 non-isolated results in a network (<xref rid="btad522-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>

      </fig>
      <p>The largest cluster of the network visualization is made up of 8 nodes and features terms related to cell migration such as ameboidal-type cell migration and actin filament organization. It has been recognized that cancer cells can use amoeboid migration as their preferred migratory strategy (Graziani <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2021). In particular, it has been shown that treatment via endocrine therapy inhibits this kind of migration in breast cancer. Furthermore, it has been shown that the organization of actin stress fibers promote proliferation of pre-invasive breast cancer cells (<xref rid="btad522-B66" ref-type="bibr">Tavares <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2017</xref>). The dysregulation of cell adhesion dynamics has also been investigated in the literature (<xref rid="btad522-B42" ref-type="bibr">Maziveyi and Alahari 2017</xref>) and is captured by the enrichment of cell-substrate adhesion and positive regulation of cell adhesion terms. In addition, the peptidyl-tyrosine modification term is enriched. Tyrosine acts as a key player in the initiation of proteins at focal adhesion sites. Apart from this, the influence of tyrosine phosphatases on many different cancer types (<xref rid="btad522-B47" ref-type="bibr">Motiwala and Jacob 2006</xref>) and of tyrosine kinases specifically on breast cancer (<xref rid="btad522-B8" ref-type="bibr">Biscardi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2000</xref>) has been recognized.</p>
      <p>The second-largest cluster made up of seven nodes is thematically related to DNA replication and conformational changes. These processes are of high relevance to cancers in general (<xref rid="btad522-B33" ref-type="bibr">Jia <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2017</xref>) as well as breast cancer specifically (<xref rid="btad522-B23" ref-type="bibr">Ghimire <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2020</xref>). Furthermore, the importance of double-strand break repair has been captured by the enrichment of the corresponding term (<xref rid="btad522-B5" ref-type="bibr">Bau <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>A few smaller clusters remain. One cluster of three nodes contains the terms chromosome segregation, non-membrane-bounded organelle assembly, and striated muscle cell differentiation. The importance of chromosomal stability and the impact of proteins which modulate it have been highlighted for breast cancer (<xref rid="btad522-B20" ref-type="bibr">Garcia and Lizcano 2016</xref>). Furthermore, it has been observed that breast cancer cells exhibit non-random chromosome segregation (<xref rid="btad522-B40" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). In addition, striated muscle cell differentiation has been linked to the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells (<xref rid="btad522-B48" ref-type="bibr">Nikulin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2021</xref>). Another cluster of three nodes contains the terms cilium movement, cilium or flagellum-dependent cell motility, and axoneme assembly. It has been shown that the expression of cilia is downregulated in various types of cancer, including breast cancer (<xref rid="btad522-B31" ref-type="bibr">Higgins <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2019</xref>). It furthermore has impact on the regulation of cancer development (<xref rid="btad522-B17" ref-type="bibr">Fabbri <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2019</xref>). The related enrichment of the axoneme assembly terms suggests the importance of the assembly and organization of an axoneme. This constitutes a novel finding and suggests further experimental investigations. The last cluster with three nodes contains the terms T-cell receptor signaling pathway, antigen receptor-mediated signaling pathway, and immune response-regulating cell surface receptor signaling pathway. Both the relevance of the T-cell receptor signaling (<xref rid="btad522-B59" ref-type="bibr">Shah <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2021</xref>) and immune response-regulating cell surface receptor signaling term (<xref rid="btad522-B54" ref-type="bibr">Rezaei-Tavirani <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2019</xref>) have been recognized. The possibility of investigating the antigen receptor-mediated signaling pathway for a Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy has very recently been considered (<xref rid="btad522-B73" ref-type="bibr">Yang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2022</xref>). Finally, the two-node cluster contains the terms translational initiation and regulation of translational initiation. The regulation of translation via changed expression of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 has been observed to play a positive role in breast cancer progression (<xref rid="btad522-B25" ref-type="bibr">Grzmil <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>In addition to the network clusters, we also detect individually enriched pathways (<xref rid="btad522-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). We find the retrograde vesicle-mediated transport, Golgi to endoplasmic reticulum term to be enriched. The potential implications of this apparatus have already been discussed (<xref rid="btad522-B61" ref-type="bibr">Spang 2013</xref>), but have, to the best of our knowledge, not been linked to breast cancer specifically. The synaptic vesicle recycling term is also enriched. Its potential as a therapeutic target has been recognized (<xref rid="btad522-B38" ref-type="bibr">Li and Kavalali 2017</xref>), however not in the context of breast cancer. In both cases, our results suggest the novel finding that these pathways may be especially relevant to breast cancer and that further experimental validations in that direction would be interesting.</p>
      <p>We also demonstrate the effectiveness of network regularization by comparing the enrichments to results obtained from running <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> without the network regularization term (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S9</xref>) and from FET (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S10</xref>). In both cases, much fewer clusters are observed, making the biological interpretation more difficult. This indicates that employing the network regularization term is useful for a better understanding of the enrichment results.</p>

    <title>4 Discussion</title>
    <p>We have developed a novel pathway enrichment method called <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> which is based on a regularized generalized linear model. It makes use of LASSO and network fusion penalty terms to produce a sparse and coherent list of enriched pathways. The network fusion term incorporates a pathway similarity network which models functional relations between pathways and clusters pathways as part of the enrichment computation in order to handle large and redundant pathway databases.</p>
    <p>In a synthetic benchmark, we show that <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> is able to outperform single-term enrichment methods such as Fisher’s exact test, a popular tool explicitly including the GO tree in its calculations as well as a model-based approach which embeds pathways in a Bayesian network.</p>
    <p>In an exploratory analysis with breast cancer samples, we were able to recover many relevant pathways already known in the literature, as well as suggest novel ones which pose interesting future targets for experimental validation.</p>
    <p>We note that <italic toggle="yes">pareg</italic> assumes that a linear combination of gene-pathway memberships is driving the overall pathway dysregulation, an assumption which may reduce the algorithm’s applicability in certain biological environments, such as the interactions between genes in myocardial infarction as measured by mRNA expression profiles (<xref rid="btad522-B30" ref-type="bibr">Hartmann <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2016</xref>).</p>
    <p>Due to the flexibility of the regression approach, potential future work could go in many directions. Instead of modeling the response variable using a Beta distribution, one may use a beta-uniform mixture which has been suggested for <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values (<xref rid="btad522-B51" ref-type="bibr">Pounds and Morris 2003</xref>). It is also possible to binarize the differential gene expression <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values (similarly to how it would have to be done for Fisher’s exact test, a classical enrichment method) into dysregulated and unaffected genes by applying a threshold. The response could then, for example, be modelled using a Bernoulli distribution. This could reduce noisy <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value estimation effects but requires the selection of another hyperparameter (the binarization threshold). As the network fusion penalty depends on a general similarity matrix, different measures could be explored. For example, there exist a wide range of different semantic similarity measures which have been used to relate GO terms (<xref rid="btad522-B34" ref-type="bibr">Jiang and Conrath 1997</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B39" ref-type="bibr">Lin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 1998</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B53" ref-type="bibr">Resnik 1999</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B58" ref-type="bibr">Schlicker <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2006</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B70" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2007</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B78" ref-type="bibr">Zhao and Wang 2018</xref>). Alternatively, similarity measures which embed sets of genes in protein-protein interaction networks and compare their localization have been shown to be useful for predicting disease status; they could be another viable choice (<xref rid="btad522-B4" ref-type="bibr">Bass <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2013</xref>, <xref rid="btad522-B44" ref-type="bibr">Menche <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2015</xref>).</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the potential effects of other regularization terms are interesting. Using an Elastic-Net term instead of LASSO or stability selection (<xref rid="btad522-B43" ref-type="bibr">Meinshausen and Bühlmann 2010</xref>) could improve the sparsity of the coefficient vector. Instead of the network fusion term, regularizations such as hierarchical feature regression (<xref rid="btad522-B50" ref-type="bibr">Pfitzinger 2021</xref>), regularized k-means clustering (<xref rid="btad522-B64" ref-type="bibr">Sun <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2012</xref>) or group LASSO (<xref rid="btad522-B76" ref-type="bibr">Yuan and Lin 2006</xref>) can be used to incorporate term-term relations and may exhibit more desirable statistical properties, such as stronger robustness to noise, smaller sample size requirements and faster convergence of the optimizer. Due to these regularization terms, it is not immediately possible to compute confidence intervals for each entry of the estimated coefficient vector. The de-biased LASSO approach (<xref rid="btad522-B72" ref-type="bibr">Xia <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2020</xref>) can be explored to get a better understanding of the uncertainty involved in the enrichment computation.</p>
    <p>Finally, while there have been programming language specific efforts to standardize gene set enrichment benchmarking workflows (<xref rid="btad522-B21" ref-type="bibr">Geistlinger <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2021</xref>), no widely accepted consensus has been found. The benchmarking workflow we implement is written in the workflow management system Snakemake (<xref rid="btad522-B46" ref-type="bibr">Mölder <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2021</xref>) and thus allows easy integration of additional tools as well as reproducible execution on different back ends. We thus hope that other enrichment tools can use a similar approach to enable comparative benchmarks of new methodologies.</p>
