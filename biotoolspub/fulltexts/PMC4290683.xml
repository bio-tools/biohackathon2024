        <title>Background</title>
        <p>Differential expression analysis of (individual) genes is often used to study their roles in diseases. However, diseases such as cancer are a result of the combined effect of multiple genes. Gene products such as proteins seldom act in isolation, but instead constitute stable multi-protein complexes performing dedicated functions. Therefore, complexes aggregate the effect of individual genes (proteins) and can be used to gain a better understanding of cancer mechanisms. Here, we observe that complexes show considerable changes in their expression, in turn directed by the concerted action of transcription factors (TFs), across cancer conditions. We seek to gain novel insights into cancer mechanisms through a systematic analysis of complexes and their transcriptional regulation.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Results</title>
        <p>We integrated large-scale protein-interaction (PPI) and gene-expression datasets to identify complexes that exhibit significant changes in their expression across different conditions in cancer. We devised a <italic>log-linear model </italic>to relate these changes to the differential regulation of complexes by TFs. The application of our model on two case studies involving pancreatic and familial breast tumour conditions revealed: (i) complexes in core cellular processes, especially those responsible for maintaining genome stability and cell proliferation (<italic>e.g</italic>. DNA damage repair and cell cycle) show considerable changes in expression; (ii) these changes include decrease and countering increase for different sets of complexes indicative of <italic>compensatory mechanisms </italic>coming into play in tumours; and (iii) TFs work in cooperative and counteractive ways to regulate these mechanisms. Such aberrant complexes and their regulating TFs play vital roles in the initiation and progression of cancer.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>Complexes in core cellular processes display considerable decreases and countering increases in expression, strongly reflective of compensatory mechanisms in cancer. These changes are directed by the concerted action of cooperative and counteractive TFs. Our study highlights the roles of these complexes and TFs and presents several case studies of compensatory processes, thus providing novel insights into cancer mechanisms.</p>

  <sec>
    <title>Background</title>
    <p>Transcriptional regulation is a fundamental mechanism by which all cellular systems mediate the activation or repression of genes, thereby setting up striking patterns of gene expression across diverse cellular conditions - <italic>e.g</italic>. across cell-cycle phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], normal <italic>vs </italic>cancer states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] or stress conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Such regulation of gene expression is executed by the concerted action of transcription factors (TFs) that bind to specific regulatory DNA sequences associated with target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Deciphering the roles of TFs is a significant challenge and has been the focus of numerous studies, with great interest being recently shown in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. For example, Bar-Joseph <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] identified periodically expressed cell-cycle genes in human foreskin fibroblasts to understand their differential regulation between normal and cancer conditions. Nebert [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] surveyed TF activities in cancer, emphasizing the roles of TFs as proto-oncogenes (gain-of-function) that serve as accelerators to activate the cell cycle, and as tumour suppressors (loss-of-function) that serve as brakes to slow the growth of cancer cells. Darnell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] classified TFs having cancerous or oncogenic potential into three main kinds - steroid receptors (<italic>e.g</italic>. oestrogen receptors in breast cancer and androgen receptors in prostate cancer), resident nuclear proteins activated by serine kinase cascades (<italic>e.g</italic>. JUN and FOS), and latent cytoplasmic factors normally activated by receptor-ligand interaction at the cell surface (<italic>e.g</italic>. STATs and NF<italic>κ</italic>B). Darnell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] also discussed the signalling pathways of these TFs (including Wnt-<italic>β</italic>-catenin, Notch and Hedgehog signalling) as potential drug targets in cancer. Karamouzis and Papavassiliou [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] discussed rewiring of transcriptional regulatory networks in breast tumours focusing on subnetworks of estrogen receptor (ERs) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRs) family members.</p>
    <p>Most studies focus on transcriptional regulation of individual target genes. However, diseases such as cancer are a result of the combined effect of multiple genes. Gene products such as proteins seldom act in isolation, but instead physically interact to constitute <italic>complexes </italic>that perform specialized functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Studying protein complexes therefore provides an aggregative or "systems level" view of gene function and regulation than studying individual proteins (genes). Here we integrate large-scale protein-interaction (PPI) and gene-expression datasets to examine the differential regulation of complexes across cancer conditions.</p>
    <sec>
      <title>An initial analysis</title>
      <p>We compiled a list of protein complexes by clustering a network of human PPIs. Co-functional (interacting) proteins are encoded by genes showing high mRNA co-expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Therefore, we quantified the "functional activity" for each of these complexes by aggregating pairwise co-expression values between their constituent proteins. Analysis for two pancreatic-tissue conditions <italic>viz </italic>normal and ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumour revealed significant changes in co-expression for these complexes between the two conditions. For example (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), CHUK-ERC1-IKBKB-IKBKG showed a change in co-expression, interestingly coinciding with changes in its transcriptional regulation by the NF<italic>κ</italic>B-family of TFs. This complex constitutes the serine/threonine kinase family, while the TFs play essential roles in NF<italic>κ</italic>B signalling pathway (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genecards.org">http://www.genecards.org</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], which are implicated in PDAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p>

          <p><bold>Changes in complex co-expression and its transcriptional regulation in pancreatic tumour</bold>. The complex CHUK-ECR1-IKBKB-IKBKG showed considerable change in its co-expression between normal and pancreatic tumour conditions. Its regulation by the NFKB family of TFs also exhibited similar changes. Both the complex and the TF family have been implicated in pancreatic tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="1752-0509-8-S4-S1-1"/>
      </fig>
      <p>Based on these observations, here we seek to understand differential co-expression of complexes and its relationship with differential regulation by TFs between cancer conditions. Therefore we:</p>
      <p>• devise a computational model to identify complexes showing significant differential co-expression and the TFs regulating these complexes; and</p>
      <p>• apply the model on two case studies - normal <italic>vs </italic>PDAC tumour and BRCA1 <italic>vs </italic>BRCA2 familial breast tumour conditions - to decipher their roles in these tumours.</p>
      <p>In summary (see Methods for details) we compute co-expression values for each of the complexes under different cancer conditions. We then introduce a log-linear model to relate changes in co-expression of complexes to changes in their regulation by TFs between these conditions. We apply the model to identify influential TFs and complexes and validate their roles in cancer.</p>

      <title>Experimental datasets</title>
      <p><italic>PPI data: </italic>We gathered <italic>Homo sapiens </italic>PPIs identified from multiple low- and high-throughput experiments deposited in Biogrid (v3.1.93) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and HPRD (2009 update) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. To minimize false positives in these PPI datasets, we employed as scoring scheme Iterative-CD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] (with 40 iterations) to assign a reliability score (between 0 and 1) to every interaction, and then discarded all low-scoring interactions (&lt; 0.20) to build a dense high-quality PPI network of 29600 interactions among 5824 proteins (average node degree 10.16).</p>
      <p><italic>Gene expression data: </italic>We have performed one of the largest gene expression profiling analyses of familial breast tumours (<italic>n </italic>= 74) and stratified them based on BRCA mutation status as BRCA1-, BRCA2- and non- BRCA1/2 tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Among these, BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumours are phenotypically most different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and we consider these two for our analysis here; our dataset contains 19 BRCA1 and 30 BRCA2 expression samples (GEO accession GSE19177). In addition, we also gathered expression samples from pancreatic tumours - normal and PDAC matched (39 in each) - from the Badea <italic>et al</italic>. study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] (GSE15471).</p>
      <p>Sporadic breast tumours constitute 93-95% of all breast tumours and most studies classify these into the four molecular subtypes, luminal-A, luminal-B, basal-like and HER2-enriched [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Broadly, basal-like tumours do not express the ER, PR and HER2 receptors, and exhibit high aggressiveness and poor survival attributed to distant metastasis, compared to luminal tumours. However, much less is known about familial tumours (the remaining 5-7%), although studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] have noted that BRCA1 tumours are predominantly basal-like while BRCA2 tumours are more hetergeneous and may be HER2-enriched or luminal-like.</p>
      <p>Pancreatic tumours, on the other hand, are more uniform with PDAC accounting for most (95%) pancreatic tumours and is predominantly characterized by dysfunctioning (by mutation) of the KRAS oncogene and of the CDKN2A, SMAD4 and TP53 tumour-suppressor genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p>
      <p><italic>Transcription factors: </italic>We gathered 1391 TFs from Vaquerizas <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], manually curated from a combined assessment of DNA-binding capabilities, evolutionary conservation and integration of multiple sources. <italic>Benchmark complexes: </italic>For independent validation, we used manually curated human complexes from CORUM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], a total of 1843 complexes of which we used 722 having size at least 4.</p>
      <p><italic>Benchmark genes and TFs in cancer: </italic>For validation we used known (mutation-driver) genes (total 118) from COSMIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and known TFs (total 82) in cancer from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p>

      <title>Analysis of PPI networks highlights considerable rewiring between tumour conditions</title>
      <p>By integrating PPI and gene expression datasets (see Methods) we obtained two pairs of conditional PPI networks - normal-PDAC for pancreatic and BRCA1-BRCA2 for breast tumours. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows the co-expression-wise distribution for protein pairs in these networks. Normal <italic>vs </italic>PDAC displayed striking differences in these distributions (KS test: <italic>D<sub>NP </sub></italic>= 23.11 <italic>&gt; K<sub>α = 0.05 </sub></italic>= 1.36), reflecting considerable rewiring of PPIs. PDAC showed significant loss in co-expression for both positively co-expressed as well as negatively co-expressed interactions compared to normal, indicative of both disruption as well as emergence of interactions in the tumour. Such rewiring has also been noted in earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Strikingly enough BRCA1 <italic>vs </italic>BRCA2 tumours also showed significant differences in PPI distributions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) (KS test: <italic>D<sub>B12 </sub></italic>= 22.85 <italic>&gt; K<sub>α = 0.05 </sub></italic>= 1.36), reflecting considerable differences in PPI wiring between the two breast tumours. BRCA1 tumours displayed higher co-expression compared to BRCA2 tumours, <italic>∼</italic>15700 PPIs with higher correlations.</p>
      <p>DAVID-based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] functional analysis of these rewired interactions (Δ <italic>≥ </italic>0.50) showed significant (<italic>p ≤ </italic>1.1) enrichment for the <italic>Biological Process </italic>(BP) terms - Cell cycle, Chromatin organisation, DNA repair and RNA splicing, indicating considerable rewiring in core cellular processes responsible for genome stability. Among these were interactions involving the tumour suppressors TP53 and SMAD4 in PDAC, which are known genes mutated in the tumour, and the DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair proteins BRE and BRCC3 along with BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53, in breast tumours.</p>

      <title>Analysis of complexes highlights disruption to core cellular mechanisms in tumours</title>
      <p>Matching of complexes using <italic>t<sub>J </sub></italic>= 0.67 and <italic>δ </italic>= 0.10 (Methods) resulted in a total of 256 and 277 matched complexes (<italic>M</italic>) for normal-PDAC and BRCA1-BRCA2 conditions, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The co-expressionwise distributions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) revealed significant differences for both normal <italic>vs </italic>PDAC as well as BRCA1 <italic>vs </italic>BRCA2 conditions (KS test: <italic>D<sub>NP </sub></italic>= 1.69 <italic>&gt; K<sub>α=0.05 </sub></italic>= 1.36 in pancreatic and <italic>D<sub>B12 </sub></italic>= 5.48 <italic>&gt;</italic>K<sub><italic>α</italic>=0.05 </sub>= 1.36 in breast), indicating that rewiring in PPI networks had considerable impact on these complexes. Overall, we noticed considerable drop in co-expression for PDAC <italic>vis-a-vis </italic>normal, whereas BRCA1 tumours showed higher co-expression <italic>vis-a-vis </italic>BRCA2 tumours (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These differences were larger towards the higher co-expression ranges which correspond better to active complexes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), indicating that cellular functions were considerably impacted in these tumours. These observations were reproducible using an independent set of complexes from CORUM (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and were significantly (<italic>p &lt;</italic>0.001) greater than expected by random (using 500 random complexes generated 1000 times).</p>

But, the decrease was steeper compared to the increase (max: 0.969 <italic>vs </italic>0.421 and 0.761 <italic>vs </italic>0.543; avg: 0.336 <italic>vs </italic>0.192 and 0.281 <italic>vs </italic>0.197). Similar trends were observed using CORUM complexes and were significantly (<italic>p &lt;</italic>0.001) greater than expected by random.

      <p>In the classical work on "hallmarks of cancer", Hanahan and Weinberg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] describe seven to ten key distinguishing hallmarks of tumour cells, among which are limitless replicative potential and self-sufficiency in growth signals. Cellular mechanisms including cell cycle and DDR are considerably weakened in tumour cells, but these cells survive on last-standing mechanisms (weak links) to continue proliferation. This is due to the activation of compensatory or back-up mechanisms. Although these compensatory mechanisms cannot completely substitute for the weakened or disrupted ones, these are sufficient to enhance the survival of tumour cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Our analysis reflect such compensatory trends - a fraction of complexes showed increase in co-expression, but the increase was not as steep as the decrease for the remaining faction. However, a straightforward Gene Ontology analysis is too general to delineate the roles of the two factions because both originate from the same or similar processes. We therefore investigated a few specific cases (below).</p>

        <title>Examples of compensatory mechanisms and validation for roles in cancer</title>
        <p><bold>Normal vs PDAC tumour </bold>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>): DSB-repair functionality is severely impacted in PDAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], with inactivating mutations in RAD50 and NBS1 attributed to loss of DSB-repair functionality increasing the risk of pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. DSBs are detected by the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) and Ku70/Ku80 (XRCC6/XRCC5) complexes in the HR and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathways, respectively. In HR, the repair process involves recruitment of the BRCA1-A complex (BRCA1-BARD1-FAM175A-UIMC1-BRE-BRCC3-MERIT40) to sites of DSBs. We observed a decrease in co-expression for all the three complexes, indicating considerable weakening of the DSB machinery. On the other hand, we noticed an increase in co-expression for the single-strand break (SSB) and mismatch (MMR) repair complexes XRCC1-POLB-PNKP-LIG3 and MSH6-MLH1-MLH2-PSM2-PCNA, respectively. The XRCC1 complex is responsible for SSB repair through sister chromatid exchange following DNA damage by ionizing radiation, while the MSH6 complex is involved in the recognition and repair of mispairs. Together these observations suggest the activation of SSB and MMR machinery compensating for the loss in DSB-repair machinery; such a functional relationship has been observed previously between DSB and SSB repair pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p>

        <p>The NF<italic>κ</italic>B signalling pathway has been strongly implicated in KRAS signalling and pancreatic tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Consistent with this, we noticed considerable changes in co-expression for several NF<italic>κ</italic>B complexes including the NF<italic>κ</italic>B1/REL family, which plays important roles in programmed cell death and proliferation control and is critical in tumour initiation and progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The calcium-binding proteins S100A2, S100A8 and S100A9 are known to modulate P53 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and their over-expression has been associated with metastatic phenotype of pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The inactivation of the RAS-associated RASSF1A and RASSF5 complexes, which act as tumour suppressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], is frequent in pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The complex DDX20-GEMIN4-PPP4C-PPP4R2 associated with the SMN (survival of motor neuron), and SNAP23-STX4-VAMP3-VAMP8 associated with vesicular transport, docking and/or fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genecards.org">http://www.genecards.org</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], support tumorigenic invasion of neural cells in pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p>
        <p><bold>BRCA1 vs BRCA2 tumours </bold>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>): We observed a lower co-expression for the MMR complex MLH1-MSH6-MSH2-PMS2-PCNA in BRCA1 tumours compared to BRCA2 tumours; we think this is due to the parallel roles of BRCA1. BRCA1 has a key role in DSB repair, and BRCA1-deficient cells have defects in the two DSB repair pathways HR and NHEJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. BRCA1 associates with PCNA and the mismatch repair proteins MSH2, MSH6 and MLH1 to form the BASC complex, a genome-surveillance complex required to sense and repair DNA damages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], thereby also playing a role in the MMR pathway. On the other hand, BRCA2 has been associated with functions only in HR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Therefore, we suspect that although MMR pathway is compensatorily activated in response to DSB-repair deficiency, BRCA1 tumours exhibit a weaker MMR pathway compared to BRCA2 tumours because of the direct involvement of BRCA1 in the MMR pathway.</p>
        <p>The DSS1 complex consisting of BRCA2, DSS1 and the integrator subunits mediates the 3'-end processing of small nuclear RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], and BRCA2 deficiency could result in a reduced stability of this complex. The expression of replication factor C complex (RFC2, RFC3 and RFC4) is indicative of proliferative potential (high cell division rates) of BRCA1 tumours. We noticed over-expression of this complex in BRCA1 compared to BRCA2 tumours.</p>
        <p>Finally, a considerable number of cancer genes from COSMIC Classic were represented in complexes showing changes Δ<italic>C ≥ </italic>0.10 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), suggesting that differential co-expression of complexes is a strong indicator of tumorigenic processes.</p>

This resulted in 226 complex-TF pairs in pancreatic and 241 in breast with non-zero Δ<italic>C </italic>and Δ<italic>R</italic>. Note that we lose at most 13% of complexes (pancreatic: 256 down to 226, breast: 277 down to 241) as a result of our requirement that TFs interact with at least one complexed protein (Methods). We observed positive Pearson and Spearman coefficients which were supported by CORUM complexes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). The Spearman coefficients were higher than Pearson in both cases, indicating a non-linear relationship; this supports our use of a log-linear model (Methods).</p>

      <title>Analysing influential TFs in pancreatic and breast tumours</title>
      <p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref> lists the TFs with non-zero <italic>overall </italic>influence identified using our model (see Methods). Extrapolating from the simplified example (see Methods), the + and <italic>− </italic>signs can be interpreted as cooperative and counteractive action of TFs in regulating complexes. As these are overall influence values (that is, across all complexes and TFs), it is difficult to interpret this straightaway. Therefore, we restrict our focus to only STAT1 and STAT3. These two TFs are directly involved in pancreatic tumorigenesis and proliferation, and are thought to play opposite roles - while STAT1 promotes apoptosis, STAT3 is essential for the proliferation and survival of tumour cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Solving Equation 5 for STAT1 and STAT3 using only the subset of complexes they share (#90), we obtained <italic>γ</italic>(STAT1) = 1.714 and <italic>γ</italic>(STAT3) = <italic>−</italic>1.582, <italic>i.e</italic>. these are counteractive TFs (Methods). Their shared complexes were enriched for Cell cycle, Apoptosis and RAS signalling, consistent with the counteractive roles for STAT1 and STAT3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p>

      <p>Differential expression analysis using limma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] for normal <italic>vs </italic>PDAC indicated that most of the influential TFs were significantly up- or down-regulated (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). But, a few influential TFs did not show such differential expression, for example heat shock factor-1 (HSF1). Investigation into the complexes regulated by HSF1 revealed considerable changes in co-expression for the cysteine-aspartic acid protease (caspase) family including CASP10-CASP8-FADD-FAS (from 1.28 to <italic>−</italic>0.019), documented in CORUM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] under the functional category '40.10.02: Apoptosis'. Caspases are involved in signal transduction pathways of apoptosis, necrosis and inflammation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genecards.org">http://www.genecards.org</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and the role of HSF1 in regulating caspases thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer has been investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>].</p>
      <p>In the case of BRCA1 <italic>vs </italic>BRCA2 tumours, only four of the influential TFs (GATA3, ESR1, FOXA1 and XBP1) were identified as differentially expressed. These four TFs are ER targets. BRCA1 tumours, being predominantly basal-like, do not express ER and therefore show lower expression of ER targets compared to BRCA2 tumours, which are predominantly luminal-like and express ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Additionally, Joshi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], using a pathway-based analysis, have noted over-representation of ESR1, GATA3, MYC, XBP1, FOXA1 and MSX2 in luminal tumours, and NF<italic>κ</italic>B1, C/EBP<italic>β</italic>, FOXO3, JUN, POU2F3 and FOXO1 in basal-like tumours. We also found higher expression of the NF<italic>κ</italic>B-signalling TFs in BRCA1 tumours - the complex NF<italic>κ</italic>B1-NF<italic>κ</italic>B2-REL-RELA-RELB composed entirely of NF<italic>κ</italic>B TFs, showed a higher correlation in BRCA1 tumours than BRCA2 tumours. This is consistent with earlier findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] that ER-negative tumours (BRCA1 tumours) display aberrant expression of NF<italic>κ</italic>B which makes these tumours highly aggressive.</p>
      <p>These observations also suggest that differential expression is not sensitive enough to identify all the genes (here, TFs) involved in tumours. Many of the TFs may not be differentially expressed themselves, but are differentially <italic>co-expressed </italic>with their target genes. One such possible situation occurs when the TFs themselves are not mutated or (epigenetically) silenced, but their target genes are.</p>
      <p>Finally, 12 of 37 TFs in pancreatic, and 14 of 40 TFs in breast tumours were among the 82 cancer TFs listed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. DAVID-based functional analysis of TFs showed significant enrichment for several pathways in cancer (<italic>p &lt;</italic>1.1E-05, 23.1% genes), in particular the JAK-STAT pathway (<italic>p &lt;</italic>1.9E-02, 10.3% genes), a known driver pathway in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p>

    <p>We had observed considerable PPI rewiring <italic>via </italic>differential co-expression analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, we now show the PPI network for normal <italic>vs </italic>PDAC with interactions weighted by the differential co-expression values. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a</xref> highlights the largest component (558 proteins and 519 interactions), which shows an overall decrease in co-expression. A considerable number of genes in this component are targets of ubiquitination (UBC) and sumoylation (SUMO1 and SUMO2) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7b</xref>) possibly causing their inactivation. However, there are several pockets showing increase in co-expression. Interestingly some of the genes topologically central to these pockets are known drug targets in PDAC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7c</xref>), <italic>e.g</italic>. PLK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] and ANAX2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Similarly PELP1 which interacts directly with STAT3 and is responsible for cell proliferation and survival in several tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], is likewise an identified drug target in PDAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. A similar analysis in BRCA1 <italic>vs </italic>BRCA2 tumours highlighted increase in PPI co-expression around the mitotic regulators CDK1, CDC20 and CKS1B and the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC6; these are known drug targets for which inhibitors have been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>].</p>

    <p>We clustered this normal <italic>vs </italic>PDAC network using MCL (inflation 2.3) both with and without the weights as input, and we observed that most clusters predominantly constitute only one kind of interactions, either those showing increase or decrease in co-expression - of the 30 clusters of sizes <italic>≥ </italic>4, in 17 at least two-thirds of the interactions show a decrease, and in 9 at least two-thirds of the interactions show an increase. Among these, PLK1 belonged to a cluster in which all interactions showed an increase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7d</xref>). Similarly, in the BRCA1 <italic>vs </italic>BRCA2 network, CDK1 and CKS1B belonged to a cluster that showed an increase for all its interactions. These observations suggest that identifying clusters (complexes) that show increase in co-expression could identify new therapeutic targets in cancer.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>Proteins seldom act in isolation, but instead interact to constitute specialized complexes driving key processes. We integrated PPI and gene-expression datasets to perform a large-scale unbaised evaluation of complexes in PDAC and familial breast tumours. These complexes showed considerable changes in expression, in particular decreases and countering increases, reflecting compensatory processes coming into play in the tumours. These complexes enable us to explain the possible underlying mechanisms, which is otherwise difficult only by analysing individual genes. These complexes are driven by the concerted action of influential TFs, which themselves work in cooperative and counteractive ways. Network-based analysis shows that complexes could have therapeutic potential in cancer.</p>

    <p><italic>From earlier work </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]<italic>(upper portion of </italic>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref><italic>): </italic>We first assemble a high-confidence network of human PPIs to identify human protein complexes. These PPIs are largely devoid of contextual (conditional) information, and therefore we overlay mRNA expression data of the coding genes, assigning a confidence score to each protein pair under normal and tumour conditions. These scores reflect the presence or absence of interactions under these conditions. Complexes are extracted from these conditional PPI networks by network clustering; for a detailed background on PPI networks and the complex-extraction procedure, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>].</p>
    <p><italic>In this work (lower portion of </italic>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref><italic>): </italic>The contribution of this work is to relate changes in co-expression of complexes to changes in their transcriptional regulation by TFs between cancer conditions by introducing a <italic>log-linear model</italic>. This enables us to identify influential TFs and to validate their roles in cancer. This procedure is described in the following subsections.</p>

      <p>Here we consider a TF to regulate a complex only if the TF physically interacts (in the PPI network) with at least one protein in the complex. From the classical view of transcriptional regulation, this assumption means that we consider a TF to regulate a set of genes encoding a complex only if the TF physically interacts with at least one protein from that complex. Although this assumption may be valid for only a subset of TFs or complexes, we employ it here to simplify our model. Indeed (see Results) we only lose at most 13% TF-complex pairs due to this assumption.</p>

        <p>Here we see that the second TF performs at least twice the regulation than the first TF on the two complexes (5 and 6 <italic>vs </italic>10 and 20), the regulation by the second TF is doubled (from 10 to 20) as against a smaller increase for the first TF (from 5 to 6) between <italic>A </italic>and <italic>B</italic>, and yet <italic>A </italic>and <italic>B </italic>show roughly the same change in co-expression (0.50 <italic>vs </italic>0.60). This intuitively means that the first TF has a greater influence than the second TF, and that counteracts the second TF to maintain the co-expression of complexes similar. Indeed upon solving the equations we get <italic>γ</italic><sub>1 </sub>= <italic>−</italic>1.293 and <italic>γ</italic><sub>2 </sub>= 0.603, which is interpreted as the first TF being about twice as influential as the second, with the two TFs working counteractively in regulating <italic>A </italic>and <italic>B</italic>. It is easy to realize a similar example for the cooperative action of TFs.</p>
