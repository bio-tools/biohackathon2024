      <p>Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis is useful for identifying genetic variants correlated with gene expression, however, it cannot distinguish between causal and nearby non-functional variants. Because the majority of disease-associated SNPs are located in regulatory regions, they can impact allele-specific binding (ASB) of transcription factors and result in differential expression of the target gene alleles. In this study, our aim was to identify functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that alter transcriptional regulation and thus, potentially impact cellular function. Here, we present regSNPs-ASB, a generalized linear model-based approach to identify regulatory SNPs that are located in transcription factor binding sites. The input for this model includes ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing) raw read counts from heterozygous loci, where differential transposase-cleavage patterns between two alleles indicate preferential transcription factor binding to one of the alleles. Using regSNPs-ASB, we identified 53 regulatory SNPs in human MCF-7 breast cancer cells and 125 regulatory SNPs in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). By integrating the regSNPs-ASB output with RNA-seq experimental data and publicly available chromatin interaction data from MCF-7 cells, we found that these 53 regulatory SNPs were associated with 74 potential target genes and that 32 (43%) of these genes showed significant allele-specific expression. By comparing all of the MCF-7 and MSC regulatory SNPs to the eQTLs in the Genome-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project database, we found that 30% (16/53) of the regulatory SNPs in MCF-7 and 43% (52/122) of the regulatory SNPs in MSC were also in eQTL regions. The enrichment of regulatory SNPs in eQTLs indicated that many of them are likely responsible for allelic differences in gene expression (chi-square test, <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.01). In summary, we conclude that regSNPs-ASB is a useful tool for identifying causal variants from ATAC-seq data. This new computational tool will enable efficient prioritization of genetic variants identified as eQTL for further studies to validate their causal regulatory function. Ultimately, identifying causal genetic variants will further our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of disease and the eventual development of potential therapeutic targets.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis has developed over the years into a powerful tool to investigate the effects of genetic variants on gene regulatory networks, identify quantitative traits for complex diseases, and derive causal inference frameworks for genomic markers and gene expression (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Fagny et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">van der Wijst et al., 2020</xref>). Specifically, eQTL analysis is designed to investigate how single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in regulatory elements directly modify the abundance of a gene transcript. The major goal of an eQTL study is to reduce the large number of variants identified from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to a list of potential causal SNPs for further investigation into how the locus contributes to disease. The validity of eQTL analysis has been demonstrated in multiple tissue types, in which high heritability has been observed in a large variety of gene transcripts (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Nica and Dermitzakis, 2013</xref>).</p>
    <p>Despite recent technological and methodological advances, eQTL analysis cannot distinguish between causal and non-functional variants that are in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD). In this study, we aim to identify functional SNPs in key regulatory regions that alter transcriptional regulation and thus, potentially impact cellular function. Such variants would be important for investigating the etiology of the associated disease and for identifying potential therapeutic targets.</p>
    <p>Surveys of GWAS indicate that about 93% of disease- and trait-associated variants lie within non-coding sequences, especially in intergenic and intronic areas (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Maurano et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, 76.5% of all non-coding GWAS SNPs are either within or in perfect LD with DNase I hypersensitive sites, which correspond to open chromatin regions that contain transcription factor (TF) binding motifs (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Maurano et al., 2012</xref>). Such variants are likely to disturb gene expression by modulating transcriptional regulatory elements, including promoters, silencers, and enhancers (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cookson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Musunuru et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Degner et al., 2012</xref>). Intronic variants can affect gene splicing by altering canonical splice sites, activating non-canonical splice sites, or changing splicing regulatory elements. In addition, intronic variants can also affect transcription regulatory motifs resulting in altered gene expression (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Vaz-Drago et al., 2017</xref>). We previously developed a computational framework called regSNPs-intron that showed high accuracy in predicting disease-causing intronic SNPs (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2019</xref>). Similar methods are needed to prioritize intragenic variants that alter binding sites of key DNA binding proteins, such as TFs, as an efficient way of identifying candidate disease-causing SNPs.</p>
    <p>Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) is a high-throughput technology that employs an engineered Tn5 transposase to map genome-wide chromatin accessibility and nucleosome positioning (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>). In open chromatin regions, DNA-binding proteins protect DNA from DNase I enzyme digestion in DNase-seq or Tn5 transposase insertion (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Thurman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Sung et al., 2016</xref>). Such protection often results in an altered pattern of enzymatic cleavage at the binding site compared to the flanking genomic region, which is referred to as a footprint. To date, many studies have inferred TF binding sites from ATAC-seq data by analyzing the digital genomic footprints left by DNA-binding proteins (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cavalli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">D’Antonio et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2018</xref>). For example, the algorithms HINT-ATAC, DeFCoM, and Mocap each focus on identifying TF binding sites from sequencing-based footprint data (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Quach and Furey, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2019</xref>). While these existing methods predict TF binding events at the single base-pair resolution, none of these tools were designed to evaluate the impact of genetic variants on TF footprints. Furthermore, like DNase I, Tn5 transposase is reported to have specific sequence bias (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2017</xref>), although the impact of this bias on ATAC-seq footprinting profiles has not been systematically investigated.</p>
    <p>Recently, the Sasquatch algorithm was developed to predict the effect of non-coding variants on TF binding by analyzing differences in DNase footprints between samples with different genotypes (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Schwessinger et al., 2017</xref>). This method improved the statistical power by effectively eliminating biases resulting from variations in the footprint patterns of different transcription factors. Here, we propose to further analyze the differences in the ATAC-seq read distribution between two heterozygous alleles from the same individual. This strategy further reduces the biases of the sequencing variation on different experiments and sample types.</p>
    <p>In our analysis, we first systematically screened for functional variants by applying a generalized linear model (GLM) based on the ATAC-seq data from two different cell lines. We further evaluated our findings using RNA-seq data from the same cell line, as well as publicly available chromatin interaction data (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Teng et al., 2015</xref>). The overall strategy presented in this study provides evidence for functional SNP activity, which can serve as the basis for generating testable hypotheses for experimental validation. Ultimately, findings generated from regSNPs-ASB are expected to aid in understanding the molecular mechanisms of complex diseases.</p>

    <title>Results</title>
    <p>Sequence variants within a TF-binding site may alter TF-binding affinity at that locus (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Johnston et al., 2019</xref>). When functional SNPs are heterozygous and TFs preferentially bind to one allele, differential ATAC-seq cleavage patterns between the two alleles are expected to result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Based on this premise, we developed a computational model called regSNPs-ASB for detecting allele-specific differences in TF occupancy on a genome-wide scale.</p>

TF binding to the site prevents the Tn5 transposase from cleaving the DNA at that location. <bold>(B)</bold> The difference in TF binding is detected in ATAC-seq data by a characteristic footprint, observed as a dip in read counts at the binding site. An allele-specific binding (ASB) event is identified by the occurrence of this footprint in one allele (top) and uniform read counts in the other allele (bottom). The ASB regions are defined by transposase cut sites shown above the plot: a = TF-binding site, b = site shoulders, c = flanking region. The number of cut sites in region b are not considered in the regSNPs-ASB model to allow for variability in the size of the TF binding motifs.</p>

      <p>The overall strategy of regSNPs-ASB is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, which consists of six steps. First, open chromatin regions and SNPs were extracted from ATAC-seq data. Second, open chromatin regions and SNPs were filtered by the quality control and the total number of cutting sites in each open chromatin region, respectively. Third, potential allele-specific TF binding sites were extracted by merging the loci of heterozygous variants and TF binding sites. Fourth, significant allele-specific TF binding events were detected using GLM. Fifth, empirical filtering was performed to avoid false positive events. The final output is a list of ASB events with associated TF and regulatory SNP information.</p>

      <p>To identify potential allele-specific transcription factor binding sites, we first conducted ATAC-seq experiments on patient-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and a breast cancer cell line (MCF7). Using the MACS2 algorithm (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2011</xref>), we identified 33,919 and 8,746 open chromatin regions in MSC and MCF7 cells, respectively. Within these regions, heterozygous SNPs were derived from the ATAC-seq BAM files using samtools (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2009</xref>). After quality control filtering, 1,119,374 and 815,852 heterozygous variants were identified in the open chromatin regions of MSC and MCF7 cells, respectively (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In each open chromatin region, we used FIMO (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Grant et al., 2011</xref>) to scan both reference and alternative sequences for putative transcription factor binding sites. In total, 3,874,515 and 1,725,376 candidate binding sites were identified from MSC and MCF7 cell lines, respectively. Among these, 40,475 binding sites contained heterozygous variants in MSC and 12,402 in MCF7.</p>

      <title>Detection of Allele-Specific TF Binding Events in MSC and MCF7 Cells</title>
      <p>For each potential TF binding site containing heterozygous variants, we asked whether there were allele-specific differences in the open chromatin regions. To address this question, a generalized linear model (see section “Materials and Methods”) was implemented to examine the differences in the ratio of the cut site frequency in the flanking regions relative to the TF footprint (i.e., the flanks-to-footprint ratio) between the reference and alternative alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
      <p>A negative binomial distribution was used in our model to account for the over-dispersion of the read counts. The coefficient of the interaction between the allele type (reference or alternative) and the region (flanking or footprint), β<sub>int</sub>, was used to evaluate whether the footprints on the putative TF-binding sites were significantly different between the two alleles. This analysis resulted in 2,417 candidate allele-specific TF binding sites in MSC and 922 sites in MCF-7 cells (FDR &lt; 0.05). Using the position weight matrices (PWM) of the candidate TFs retrieved from the JASPAR database (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2018</xref>), we further calculated the position-specific scoring matrices (PSSM) scores (see section “Materials and Methods”) of the candidate allele-specific TF-binding sites for both reference and alternative alleles. Overall, we detected 406 and 122 candidate TF-binding sites in MSC and MCF7 cell lines with a significant β<sub>int</sub> value and a sizable PSSM score difference (| deltaPSSM| &gt; 5). Since each variant can potentially disrupt the binding sites of multiple TFs, 125 and 53 heterozygous SNPs in MSC and MCF7 were identified with the potential to disrupt TF binding. The number of TFs whose binding sites were disrupted by each heterozygous variant are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>. A complete list of these variants can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS2">S2</xref>. In addition, the β<sub>int</sub> values, the ATAC-seq read distribution on and flanking the putative sites, and the deltaPSSM, can be found in an RShiny website<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="footnote1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Examples of the ATAC-seq signal distribution for two TF binding sites on the reference and alternative alleles identified by regSNPs-ASB are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>. For SNP rs7164266, regSNPs-ASB detected a decrease in the footprint on the alternative allele. The matching score differences (deltaPSSM = 7.24) further supported the regSNPs-ASB prediction. Since rs7164266 occurs in a CTCF-binding motif, this finding suggests that the variant allele could potentially repress CTCF binding to this site. On the contrary, for rs6752740, a SNP located in a putative KLF14 binding site, a clear footprint was observed on the alternative allele, but not on the reference allele. This finding indicates that the rs6752740 SNP could enhance KLF14 binding, which was supported by the matching score differences (deltaPSSM = −5.48). The ratio of the number of ATAC-seq cutting sites between the two alleles on putative TF binding sites (X) versus the flanking regions (Y) was plotted for all of the identified events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the regSNPs-ASB algorithm can identify genome-wide allele-specific TF binding events from ATAC-seq data.</p>

      <title>Correlation of Allele-Specific TF Binding and Allele-Specific Gene Expression</title>
      <p>We next asked whether the allele-specific TF binding predicted by regSNPs-ASB correlated with allele-specific gene expression. To address this question, we first identified likely target genes for the heterozygous variants that exhibited allele-specific TF binding. For putative promoter variants, the closest gene to each variant was considered as the target gene. However, because enhancer variants can be far away from their target genes, Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) and its derivative techniques have become the major biochemical approaches to study such distal transcriptional regulation and chromatin interactions. Therefore, potential enhancer regulatory SNPs were combined with 3C experimental interaction data obtained from the 4Dgenome database. For this analysis, we focused on MCF-7 cells since 3C data was not available for MSCs. In MCF7 cells, 8 of the 53 heterozygous variants that exhibited allele-specific TF binding were located in the promoter or 5′UTR regions, while the other 45 SNPs were located in intronic or distal intergenic regions and were considered potential enhancer regulatory SNPs. For these 45 putative enhancer SNPs, 66 potential target genes were identified in the 4Dgenome database.</p>
      <p>Allele-specific expression analysis for the target genes was conducted using heterozygous variants in the open reading frame of the putative target genes. We found that 75% (6/8) of the target genes associated with promoter variants and 39% (26/66) of the target genes associated with putative enhancer variants showed significant allele-specific expression (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.01, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS7">Supplementary Table S7</xref>).</p>
      <p>One example of the chromatin interaction analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, where allele-specific binding on rs151202 was observed in the ATAC-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).

      <title>Correlation of Allele-Specific TF Binding and Allele-Specific Gene Expression</title>
      <p>We next asked whether the regulatory SNPs identified by regSNPs-ASB could be found in a list of eQTL signals. To address this question, we compared all of the regulatory SNPs identified in MCF-7 and MSC to the eQTLs in the GTEx database. We found that 30.2% (16/53) of the regulatory SNPs in MCF-7 and 42.6% (52/122) of the regulatory SNPs in MSC were also eQTLs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS3">Supplementary Tables S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS4">S4</xref>). This enrichment was significant when compared to non-regulatory SNPs (chi-square test, <italic>p</italic>-value = 1.52E-08). Thus, SNPs identified by regSNPs-ASB that are also in eQTLs could be prioritized for experimental validation of their functional role as the causal variants involved in the target gene regulation.</p>
      <p>Based on the finding that regulatory SNPs are significantly enriched in eQTLs, we further tested whether our method could be used to identify plausible causal SNPs that modulate TF binding from a list of GWAS SNPs associated with specific cell systems. Notably, rs7943121 was identified as a SNP that weakens the binding of the transcriptional repressor CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) (FDR = 0.033, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). This SNP was also identified as an eQTL in breast mammary tissue that could modulate <italic>SPT2 chromatin protein domain containing 1</italic> (<italic>SPTY2D1</italic>) expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Furthermore, we also observed that rs7943121 was in strong LD (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.8) with rs10832963, which is one of the most significant GWAS-SNPs associated with breast cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Michailidou et al., 2017</xref>). Overall, these results provide compelling evidence that regulatory SNPs detected by regSNPs-ASB can potentially be the drivers of previous-reported eQTL and GWAS signals.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>eQTLs and GWAS are conventional methods for mapping association variants that have identified tens of thousands of loci that are highly correlated with gene expression and common diseases, respectively. However, screening for the true causal variants remains a challenging problem. In this study, we introduced a computational method, regSNPs-ASB, for detecting regulatory SNPs that affect transcription factor binding using ATAC-seq data. The major conclusion of this study is that by integrating ATAC-seq data with RNA-seq expression data, chromatin conformation data and LD information from SNP datasets, regSNPs-ASB is able to efficiently evaluate the regulatory functions of SNPs in disease contexts. This conclusion is based on the following evidence: First, we systematically detected potential regulatory SNPs with allele-specific differences in TF occupancy using a statistical test. Second, we provided evidence that regulatory SNPs can affect the expression of their target genes. Finally, we found that regulatory SNPs are significantly enriched within expression-correlated variants compared with non-regulatory SNPs in the GTEx database. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the regSNPs-ASB algorithm can be used to identify causal variants from ATAC-seq data, and thereby, further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of complex diseases.</p>
    <p>Our method is developed based on the established strategy for conducting allele-specific analysis on many types of sequencing data, which specifically focus on the sequencing reads on heterozygous loci. This includes allele-specific gene expression (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Castel et al., 2015</xref>), allele-specific alternative splicing analysis (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Nembaware et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2012</xref>), allele-specific binding of ChIP-seq (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">de Santiago et al., 2017</xref>) and CLIP-seq data analysis (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2019</xref>), allele-specific chromatin interaction (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Cavalli et al., 2019</xref>), and allele-specific chromatin accessibility (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Harvey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). To our knowledge, our method is the first to analyze allele-specific footprint.</p>
    <p>When designing regSNPs-ASB, we considered several potential issues that could arise from technical artifacts. On the one hand, the intrinsic sequence bias of DNase I and Tn5 enzymes has a striking effect on the average cut profile over a specific TF-binding motif, which is a major limitation of current genomic footprinting methods (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Yardımcı et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). regSNPs-ASB effectively eliminates the impact of sequence preference bias, since this algorithm focuses on identifying the differences in the cut-site distribution between two alleles of a single locus, where the technical variability should be the same. For the same reason, our model is insensitive to the differences in the intrinsic footprint patterns from different TF domains. On the other hand, cancer cell lines often contain copy-number variants, which complicate the detection of allele-specific TF binding. Traditional ChIP-based methods for identifying allele-specific TF binding (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cavalli et al., 2016</xref>), cannot effectively distinguish gene expression changes that are caused by allele-specific copy number amplification from the effects caused by allele-specific TF binding. regSNPs-ASB ignores this feature of cancer genomes because it detects differences in footprint shape that result from TF-binding, rather than the imbalance of read counts from different alleles. By avoiding these technical problems, regSNPs-ASB effectively screens for allele-specific TF binding in an unbiased manner.</p>
    <p>We also note that there are some limitations of regSNPs-ASB. First, although this model can effectively evaluate TFs with shallow footprints that are caused by transient interactions with DNA, regSNPs-ASB, like all other footprinting-based computational algorithms, cannot detect TFs that do not leave footprints because of their short occupancy time (on the order of seconds). In that case, the differential TF binding events cannot be detected by ATAC-seq and technological improvements will be needed to capture those events. Second, the proposed method can only be applied on the heterozygous loci in the genome, and cannot be used to identify the functional variants on the homozygous variants. In addition, regSNPs-ASB infers TF occupancy from open chromatin regions that contain a probabilistic match to TF consensus recognition motifs, which limits the ability to identify TFs whose motif sequences are not known. However, this limitation will diminish as new TF motifs are discovered and included in the JASPAR database.</p>
    <p>It should be noted that the proposed methods are designed for the cell systems with diploid genomes, which may not be appropriate to study the cell systems with complicated chromosome rearrangement, including tumors and cancer cells that have aberrant CNV (copy number variation) and LOH (lost of heterogeneity). In theory, our method can be applied on the genomic loci with somatic mutations. At such loci, however, since only a proportion of the cells will carry the same mutation, the power of our method for detecting such variants may be compromised.</p>
    <p>In summary, we show that the regSNPs-ASB algorithm is effective in identifying candidate causal SNPs from ATAC-seq data. This new computational tool will enable efficient prioritization of genetic variants identified by association studies for further studies to validate their causal regulatory function. Ultimately, identifying causal genetic variants will further our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of disease.</p>

      <p>where y is the number of ATAC-seq reads in which the Tn5 cleavage position mapped to a specific region and allele; x<sub>r</sub> and x<sub>a</sub> are binary predictor variables that indicate the region where a cleavage event happened (0 = binding site and 1 = flanking region) and the allele that the fragment mapped to (0 = reference allele and 1 = alternative allele), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>); β<sub>r</sub> and β<sub>a</sub> are the regression coefficients used to estimate the relationship between the scalar response and x<sub>r</sub> and x<sub>a</sub>. In addition, β<sub>0</sub> indicates the average sequencing depth around a heterozygous site and ε is the random error. Logarithm is the canonical link function when the response variable follows a negative binomial distribution. Our null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) is: β<sub>int</sub> = 0. Rejecting the null hypothesis indicates that the allelic imbalance differs between reference and alternative alleles. A positive or negative β<sub>int</sub> value indicates a gain or loss of binding ability to the variant, respectively. False discovery rate was calculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>).</p>

      <title>Regulatory SNPs Target Gene Identification</title>
      <p>For each regulatory SNP, we first used SnpSift (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Cingolani et al., 2012</xref>) to retrieve the corresponding reference SNP ID number (rsID) before querying the SNPs to the Short Genetic Variations database (dbSNP). ANNOVAR (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Hakonarson et al., 2010</xref>) was used to annotate the location of each SNP. Variants located within a 1 kb region upstream or downstream of a transcription start site were considered as potential promoter regions. The remaining regulatory SNPs were considered as enhancers using chromatin interaction data from the 4DGenome database<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="footnote2">2</xref></sup>. Each record in this database includes three parts: a chromatin interaction between two genomic regions, genes located in the interacting regions, and the experimentally-derived or computationally-predicted data used to detect the genomic interaction. BEDTools <italic>IntersectBed</italic> (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>) was used to examine overlaps between regulatory SNPs and interacting chromatin regions. For any genomic region overlapping with regulatory SNPs, genes located in the paired interacting region were recognized as potential target genes for the corresponding regulatory SNPs.</p>

      <title>Allele-Specific Expression Analysis</title>
      <p>Typical allele-specific expression analysis seeks to capture allelic imbalance of reference and alternative alleles in RNA-seq read counts covering heterozygous sites. Under the null hypothesis of balanced expression, the fraction of allelic read counts is expected to fit a binomial distribution (N, 0.5). For each regulatory SNP target gene, we used a binomial test to detect whether allele-specific expression occurred at each coding SNP based on the corresponding RNA-seq data. All target genes that reject the null hypothesis (<italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.05) were considered genes with allele-specific expression.</p>

      <title>SNP Linkage Disequilibrium Analysis</title>
      <p>We used the 1000 Genome Project Phase 3 variants<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="footnote3">3</xref></sup> (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Auton et al., 2015</xref>) and plink2 (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2015</xref>) to conduct the linkage disequilibrium analysis. First, vcf file formats were converted to the corresponding pgen, psam, and pvar file formats using <italic>plink –vcf</italic>. Then we calculated <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> and D’ between each SNP and disease-correlated GWAS-SNP using <italic>plink –out</italic>. The linkage disequilibrium results were plotted by the genetic variant-centered annotation browser, SNiPA (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Arnold et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

      <title>eQTL Analysis</title>
      <p>The eQTL analysis was performed using GTEx v7 data<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="footnote4">4</xref></sup>. We classified a regulatory SNP as a genetic variant exerting regulatory effects on the expression of gene if it was completely overlapping with any eQTL in the corresponding tissue.</p>
