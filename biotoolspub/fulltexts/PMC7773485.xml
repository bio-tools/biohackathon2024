        <title>Motivation</title>
        <p>Disordered flexible linkers (DFLs) are abundant and functionally important intrinsically disordered regions that connect protein domains and structural elements within domains and which facilitate disorder-based allosteric regulation. Although computational estimates suggest that thousands of proteins have DFLs, they were annotated experimentally in &lt;200 proteins. This substantial annotation gap can be reduced with the help of accurate computational predictors. The sole predictor of DFLs, DFLpred, trade-off accuracy for shorter runtime by excluding relevant but computationally costly predictive inputs. Moreover, it relies on the local/window-based information while lacking to consider useful protein-level characteristics.</p>

      <sec id="s2">
        <title>Results</title>
        <p>We conceptualize, design and test APOD (<bold>A</bold>ccurate <bold>P</bold>redictor <bold>O</bold>f <bold>D</bold>FLs), the first highly accurate predictor that utilizes both local- and protein-level inputs that quantify propensity for disorder, sequence composition, sequence conservation and selected putative structural properties. Consequently, APOD offers significantly more accurate predictions when compared with its faster predecessor, DFLpred, and several other alternative ways to predict DFLs. These improvements stem from the use of a more comprehensive set of inputs that cover the protein-level information and the application of a more sophisticated predictive model, a well-parametrized support vector machine. APOD achieves area under the curve = 0.82 (28% improvement over DFLpred) and Matthews correlation coefficient = 0.42 (180% increase over DFLpred) when tested on an independent/low-similarity test dataset. Consequently, APOD is a suitable choice for accurate and small-scale prediction of DFLs.</p>

    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in protein sequences are functionally important while lacking a stable tertiary structure <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="btaa808-B16" ref-type="bibr">Dunker <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B21" ref-type="bibr">Habchi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B46" ref-type="bibr">Oldfield <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019a</xref>,<xref rid="btaa808-B47" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B62" ref-type="bibr">van der Lee <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) can be fully or partially unstructured, where in the latter (more frequent) case they include one of more IDRs. Previous studies have shown that the IDPs/IDRs are very common across all kingdoms of life, particularly in eukaryotes, and carry out a variety of important cellular functions that cover regulation, signaling, translation and transcription (<xref rid="btaa808-B5" ref-type="bibr">Babu, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Kriwacki, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B15" ref-type="bibr">Dunker <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B29" ref-type="bibr">Kjaergaard and Kragelund, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B31" ref-type="bibr">Lieutaud <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B37" ref-type="bibr">Meng <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B53" ref-type="bibr">Peng <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B64" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B66" ref-type="bibr">Xie <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p>
    <p>The DisProt database is the primary source of the experimentally and functionally annotated IDPs/IDRs (<xref rid="btaa808-B23" ref-type="bibr">Hatos <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). According to a recent analysis, the second most commonly annotated function of IDPs/IDRs is entropic chain, behind only the molecular recognition function (<xref rid="btaa808-B26" ref-type="bibr">Katuwawala <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019a</xref>,<xref rid="btaa808-B27" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>,<xref rid="btaa808-B28" ref-type="bibr">c</xref>). Close to 75% of the entropic chains include disordered flexible linker (DFL) regions. The current version 8.0 of DisProt includes slightly over 100 proteins with the DFL regions. These disordered regions are characterized by extreme flexibility (lack of defined structure) and act as connectors between protein domains and between structural elements/constituents that make up domains (<xref rid="btaa808-B14" ref-type="bibr">Dunker <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). The defining differences between flexible linkers (<xref rid="btaa808-B10" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) and DFLs are the degree of flexibility (flexible versus disordered), length (DFL tends to be longer) and localization (inter-domain versus. inter- and intra-domain; <xref rid="btaa808-B36" ref-type="bibr">Meng and Kurgan, 2016</xref>). DFLs have many important functional roles that center around facilitation and regulation of inter- and intra-domain movement. Specific examples include peptide aggregation (<xref rid="btaa808-B59" ref-type="bibr">Shvadchak and Subramaniam, 2014</xref>), connecting multiple disordered protein binding regions (<xref rid="btaa808-B45" ref-type="bibr">Oldfield and Dunker, 2014</xref>), movement of structured domains between catalytic sites (<xref rid="btaa808-B2" ref-type="bibr">Anand and Mohanty, 2012</xref>), and allosteric regulation (<xref rid="btaa808-B60" ref-type="bibr">Sorensen and Kjaergaard, 2019</xref>). Moreover, recent computational analysis suggests that thousands of proteins are likely to harbor these regions. More specifically, about 7% of human proteins were shown to have at least one long putative DFL region (20 or more consecutive residues in length) and 10% of human proteins have at least 30% of their residues serving as putative DFLs (<xref rid="btaa808-B36" ref-type="bibr">Meng and Kurgan, 2016</xref>).</p>
    <p>Given the high-levels of abundance and functional importance of these regions, and the relatively low numbers of the experimentally annotated DFLs, it may came as a surprise that there is only one computational tool that predicts DFLs, DFLpred (<xref rid="btaa808-B6" ref-type="bibr">Barik <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B26" ref-type="bibr">Katuwawala <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019a,b,c</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B36" ref-type="bibr">Meng and Kurgan, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B38" ref-type="bibr">Meng <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). DFLpred was recently used to assist with functional characterization of several protein domains including SH3 (<xref rid="btaa808-B3" ref-type="bibr">Arbesu and Pons, 2019</xref>) and RRS1 (<xref rid="btaa808-B20" ref-type="bibr">Guo <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). However, the main drawback of this computational tool is its limited quality of the predictive performance. DFLpred was designed to offer very fast but only modestly accurate predictions. The latter is due to the exclusion of relevant but computationally costly predictive inputs, such as sequence conservation (CONS) and putative/sequence-derived structural characteristics, e.g. secondary structure (SS) and solvent accessibility. These characteristics were previously used as powerful markers of functional sites (<xref rid="btaa808-B63" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Samudrala, 2006</xref>), including functional IDRs, such as molecular recognition features (MoRFs; <xref rid="btaa808-B12" ref-type="bibr">Disfani <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B22" ref-type="bibr">Hanson <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B26" ref-type="bibr">Katuwawala <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019a,b,c</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B33" ref-type="bibr">Malhis and Gsponer, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B34" ref-type="bibr">Malhis <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B56" ref-type="bibr">Sharma <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018a</xref>,<xref rid="btaa808-B57" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B67" ref-type="bibr">Yan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Moreover, DFLpred relies solely on the information extracted from a local sequence fragment (sliding window), and does not use the protein-level information. A case in point for using protein-level characteristics is the observation that the IDPs involved in different functions have different amounts of intrinsic disorder (<xref rid="btaa808-B51" ref-type="bibr">Peng <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="btaa808-B53" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). This is also observed for the IDPs with DFLs which were shown to have about 45% lower disorder content (DisCon; fraction of disordered residues) compared with the other IDPs (<xref rid="btaa808-B36" ref-type="bibr">Meng and Kurgan, 2016</xref>). Finally, DFLpred applies a simple logistic regression (LR) model, while more sophisticated (albeit slower) models are available.</p>
    <p>Motivated by the above-mentioned drawbacks of DFLpred, we introduce a novel predictor of DFLs, APOD (<bold>A</bold>ccurate <bold>P</bold>redictor <bold>O</bold>f <bold>D</bold>FLs), which aims to provide (significantly more) accurate predictions of the DFLs. Our design includes a comprehensive selection of relevant predictive inputs, combines both local- and protein-level information and uses an advanced and well-parametrized predictive model. Consequently, as our empirical study shows, APOD offers very accurate results at the expense of a longer runtime.</p>

    <title>2 Materials and methods</title>
    <sec>
      <title>2.1 Benchmark datasets</title>
      <p>We source our data from the current release 8.0 of DisProt (<xref rid="btaa808-B23" ref-type="bibr">Hatos <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>) and we follow the annotation protocol from (<xref rid="btaa808-B36" ref-type="bibr">Meng and Kurgan, 2016</xref>). Using the functional annotations DisProt we annotated 5893 residues in 175 DFL regions that are located in 117 IDPs. For convenience we use the term ‘DFL protein’ to denote IDP that has at least one DFL. We also extracted a set of non-DFL proteins to test the ability of our predictor to separate DFL from the non-DFL residues. Consistent with (<xref rid="btaa808-B36" ref-type="bibr">Meng and Kurgan, 2016</xref>), to reduce the number of potential false negatives, we collected 131 proteins that have majority of their residues functionally annotated and where this annotation is not DFL. The residues without functional annotations were excluded from the design and assessment. In other words, only the disordered residues with the non-DFL functional annotations and the structured residues are marked and used as the negatives.</p>
      <p>Following (<xref rid="btaa808-B36" ref-type="bibr">Meng and Kurgan, 2016</xref>), we cluster the corresponding 117 + 131 = 248 protein sequences using BLASTClust (<xref rid="btaa808-B1" ref-type="bibr">Altschul <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>) at the 25% sequence identity. We divide the resulting 194 clusters into training and test datasets at random, where the training set (TR166) includes 166 sequences with 3661 DFL residues, and the test set (TE82) is composed of 82 chains with 2223 DFL residues. The placement of entire clusters into the two datasets ensures that training and test proteins share below 25% sequence similarity. We use the TR166 set to design and optimize our predictive model by performing 5-fold cross validation. We utilize the independent/dissimilar TE82 set to assess and compare APOD with the current DFLpred predictor. We note that the test dataset is similar in size to the datasets used in the CASP experiments (<xref rid="btaa808-B30" ref-type="bibr">Kryshtafovych <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>) and is slightly larger than the test set used by the authors of DFLpred (<xref rid="btaa808-B36" ref-type="bibr">Meng and Kurgan, 2016</xref>). The TR166 and TE82 datasets are available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://yanglab.nankai.edu.cn/APOD/benchmark/" ext-link-type="uri">https://yanglab.nankai.edu.cn/APOD/benchmark/</ext-link>.</p>

      <title>2.2 Architecture of the APOD predictor</title>
      <p>As shown in <xref rid="btaa808-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, APOD takes protein sequence as the only input and processes it in two steps to produce prediction for every residue. The first step involves use of several third-party programs to provide a rich <italic toggle="yes">sequence profile</italic> that characterizes relevant (putative) structural properties of the input chain. More precisely (<xref rid="btaa808-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), these properties include the amino acid composition (AAC) extracted directly from the input sequence, CONS generated with PSI-BLAST (<xref rid="btaa808-B1" ref-type="bibr">Altschul <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>), putative SS and the relative solvent accessibility (RSA) predicted with SPARKS-X (<xref rid="btaa808-B68" ref-type="bibr">Yang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) and putative intrinsic disorder derived from the DISOPRED3 prediction (<xref rid="btaa808-B39" ref-type="bibr">Meszaros <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>), which includes the sliding window-based representation of disorder (SWdis) and protein-level DisCon value. To compare, DFLpred used an inferior profile with only the information extracted directly from the sequence and putative disorder predicted with IUPred, which offers lower predictive performance than DISOPRED3 (<xref rid="btaa808-B26" ref-type="bibr">Katuwawala <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019a,b,c</xref>). In the second step, this profile is converted into a custom-designed feature vector that is processed by a support vector machine (SVM) model to produce the predictions. We derive the total of 170 features by including both the protein-level features (that quantify the DisCon) and the local window-based features; see Section 2.3 for the detailed description of these features. To compare, DFLpred relies exclusively on the local window-based features.

      <p>The predictions take form of numeric propensity scores, which quantify likelihood that a given residue is in the DFL region, and the corresponding binary score, which categorizes a given residue as either DFL or non-DFL.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.3 Encoding of the sequence profile</title>
      <p>We custom-encode the sequence profile, which covers selected relevant sequence-based and putative structural characteristics of the input protein chain, into the feature vector that has two main parts: the protein-level and the local sliding window-level features.</p>
      <sec>
        <title>2.3.1 Protein-level features</title>
        <p>The IDPs that carry out different cellular functions usually show distinct distributions of DisCon (i.e. fraction of disordered residues in a given sequence; <xref rid="btaa808-B53" ref-type="bibr">Peng <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). This is also true for DFL proteins that were shown to have lower DisCon compared with the other IDPs (<xref rid="btaa808-B36" ref-type="bibr">Meng and Kurgan, 2016</xref>). Consistent with these findings, we observe that the average DisCon for the DFL proteins is about 31% lower than that of other IDPs in TR166 dataset. Moreover, DFLs are the definition intrinsically disordered, and thus they are not present in the structured protein that has DisCon of 0. We screen out the structured proteins and the other IDPs by utilizing the protein-level feature that quantifies the DisCon.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>2.3.2 Local window-based features</title>
        <p>As the structural and functional characteristics of residue are indirectly affected by its neighbors in a sequence (<xref rid="btaa808-B9" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), the technique of sliding window is usually utilized to capture the sequence-local characteristics of a predicted residue. This window-based approach was successfully applied to predict other related disorder characteristics including MoRFs (<xref rid="btaa808-B12" ref-type="bibr">Disfani <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B22" ref-type="bibr">Hanson <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B26" ref-type="bibr">Katuwawala <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019a,b,c</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B34" ref-type="bibr">Malhis <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B46" ref-type="bibr">Oldfield <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019a,b</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B49" ref-type="bibr">Peng and Kurgan, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B58" ref-type="bibr">Sharma <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>), IDRs that interact with nucleic acids (<xref rid="btaa808-B49" ref-type="bibr">Peng and Kurgan, 2015</xref>), IDR that interact with proteins (<xref rid="btaa808-B13" ref-type="bibr">Dosztanyi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B39" ref-type="bibr">Meszaros <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B49" ref-type="bibr">Peng and Kurgan, 2015</xref>) and DFL (<xref rid="btaa808-B36" ref-type="bibr">Meng and Kurgan, 2016</xref>). We utilize empirical experiment based on the 5-fold cross validation on the training set TR166 to optimize the size of the sliding window to 13 residue (see Section 3.2). We use this window to derive the following four types of features:</p>
        <p><italic toggle="yes">AAC</italic>. DFLs were observed to be enriched with polar uncharged amino acids (AAs). This facilitates the ability of the connecting domains to twist and rotate, and to recruit their binding partners via protein domain dynamics (<xref rid="btaa808-B7" ref-type="bibr">Bu and Callaway, 2011</xref>). We therefore computed the 20 AACs in the sliding window. Motivated by the approach taken in (<xref rid="btaa808-B12" ref-type="bibr">Disfani <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), we also compute another 20 features that quantify the difference in the AAC between the residues inside the sliding window (i.e. <italic toggle="yes">near neighbors</italic>) and the residues flanking the window (i.e. <italic toggle="yes">remote neighbors</italic>). We use the six flanking residues on each end of the window to mimic the size of the window. Total number of features: 40.</p>
        <p><italic toggle="yes">Conservation-related features (CONS).</italic> Evolutionary conservation is an important indicator of functional residues in protein chains (<xref rid="btaa808-B4" ref-type="bibr">Atas <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). This information can be easily derived from the alignment profiles generated with programs such as the popular PSI-BLAST (<xref rid="btaa808-B1" ref-type="bibr">Altschul <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). We run PSI-BLAST with the default parameters against the NCBI’s (National Center for Biotechnology Information) non-redundant database. We use the probability matrix produced by PSI-BLAST to derive the conservation scores using the popular relative entropy (RE)-based approach (<xref rid="btaa808-B63" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Samudrala, 2006</xref>):

Using the sliding window of size 13, we extract the 13 RE values, we compute their average (AVG) and SD, and the differences between the AVG of REs for the near neighbors and the remote neighbors.

Total number of features: 40 PSSM-based + 16 RE-related = 56.</p>
        <p><italic toggle="yes">SS- and RSA-based features.</italic> SS defines a local conformation in the protein chain, which comprises of <inline-formula id="IE10"><mml:math id="IM10" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mo>α</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>-helices, <inline-formula id="IE11"><mml:math id="IM11" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mo>β</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>-sheets and <inline-formula id="IE12"><mml:math id="IM12" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mo>γ</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>-coils. RSA quantifies the solvent exposure of residues and is defined by the ratio of the solvent accessible area to the maximum possible solvent accessible area for the residue (<xref rid="btaa808-B61" ref-type="bibr">Tien <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). We applied SPARKS-X (<xref rid="btaa808-B68" ref-type="bibr">Yang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) to predict the SS and the solvent accessible surface area. This is one of a very few methods that couples both predictions (saving runtime) while providing high predictive performance. We focus on the putative <inline-formula id="IE13"><mml:math id="IM13" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mo>γ</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>-coil regions as they typically constitute DFLs (<xref rid="btaa808-B36" ref-type="bibr">Meng and Kurgan, 2016</xref>), while complementing the combined content of the <inline-formula id="IE14"><mml:math id="IM14" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mo>α</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>-helix and <inline-formula id="IE15"><mml:math id="IM15" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mo>β</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>-sheet regions.

Total number of features: 2 + 4 + 32 = 38.</p>
        <p><italic toggle="yes">Intrinsic disorder-based features (SWdis).</italic> Putative Intrinsic disorder is a powerful marker of DFLs since by definition these are disordered regions. This claim is supported by the design of DFLpred where the putative disorder played key role to implement the underlying predictive model (<xref rid="btaa808-B36" ref-type="bibr">Meng and Kurgan, 2016</xref>). We use the disorder prediction generated with DISOPRED3 (<xref rid="btaa808-B39" ref-type="bibr">Meszaros <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) since this is consistently one of the most accurate methods (<xref rid="btaa808-B26" ref-type="bibr">Katuwawala <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019a,b,c</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B32" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B43" ref-type="bibr">Monastyrskyy <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="btaa808-B44" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). We derive the following features from the outputs produced by DISOPRED3: disorder propensities for the 13 residues in the window, their AVG and STD values, the difference of AVG between the near and the remote neighbors, binary disorder predictions for the 13 residues in the window, the DisCon (i.e. the frequency of the disordered residues) in the window and its difference with the DisCon of the remote neighbors, and finally the number of putative IDRs in the window and their average, minimal and maximal length. Total number of features: 13 + 2 + 1 + 13 + 2 + 4 = 35.</p>

      <title>2.4 Point biserial correlation coefficient</title>
      <p>We assess the predictive value of these features based on the correlation between their numeric values and the binary residue-level annotations of DFLs.

      <p>The prediction of DFL includes two values: the binary score (DFL versus non-DFL residue) and the numeric propensity score that quantifies likelihood that a given residue forms DFL. Given that our datasets are unbalanced, i.e. majority of residues are non-DFLs, we utilize the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) (<xref rid="btaa808-B35" ref-type="bibr">Matthews, 1975</xref>), the precision (Pre) and the recall (Rec) as the metrics to evaluate the quality of the binary prediction.

      <p>We also evaluate statistical significance of differences in the values of AUC and MCC between APOD and other alternative methods for the prediction of DFLs. This test investigates whether the differences are consistent across a range of different (test) datasets. To this end, we divide the test set TE82 at random into 10 equally sized protein subsets, each with 8 or 9 proteins. Next, we calculate and compare the 10 corresponding AUC/MCC values between APOD and each of the other considered predictor. If both vectors of the AUC/MCC values are normal, as tested using Anderson–Darling test at the 0.05 significance, then we utilize <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test; otherwise we used the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test.

SVM is a popular algorithm that was extensively used to generate predictive models in closely related areas that include prediction of MoRFs (<xref rid="btaa808-B12" ref-type="bibr">Disfani <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B18" ref-type="bibr">Fang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B34" ref-type="bibr">Malhis <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B55" ref-type="bibr">Sharma <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>, <xref rid="btaa808-B56" ref-type="bibr">2018a,b</xref>, <xref rid="btaa808-B58" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B67" ref-type="bibr">Yan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) disordered protein-binding regions (<xref rid="btaa808-B25" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Cozzetto, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B69" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>), protein-peptide interactions (<xref rid="btaa808-B70" ref-type="bibr">Zhao <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) and IDRs (<xref rid="btaa808-B24" ref-type="bibr">Ishida and Kinoshita, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B25" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Cozzetto, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B40" ref-type="bibr">Mizianty <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="btaa808-B41" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, <xref rid="btaa808-B42" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B50" ref-type="bibr">Peng <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="btaa808-B65" ref-type="bibr">Ward <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). We compare these two algorithms based on the 5-fold cross validation on the training set TR166. We carefully parametrize both LR and SVM by searching over a suitable parameter space. For the LR algorithm, we set the sole <italic toggle="yes">ridge</italic> parameter ridge to equal 10<sup><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sup> where <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> = −6, −5, …, 6.

      <title>3.1 Comparison of the LR and SVM models</title>
      <p>We empirically compare the predictive quality generated by two types of machine learning algorithms: LR and SVM. We perform this comparison based on the 5-fold cross validation on the training set TR166. The results are summarized in <xref rid="btaa808-F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. The figure makes it clear that the SVM model is superior to the LR model, especially given the consistency of the improvements over the entire range of the window sizes <italic toggle="yes">ws</italic>. Improvements in MCC span between 11.4% and 24.4%, whereas AUC is higher by between 2.2% and 9.5% across different window sizes. Interestingly, the AUCs of the LR model decrease as the window size increases (<xref rid="btaa808-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). This suggests that this simple models is incapable of taking advantage of the additional information coming from a larger window, which arguably has higher noise-to-signal rate. In contrast, the AUCs of SVM initially slightly increase as the window size grows and they plateau for the longer windows. The SVM’s AUCs range between 0.807 and 0.810, and the MCCs vary between 0.355 and 0.380 across different window sizes. Interestingly, the largest values of AUC = 0.81 and MCC = 0.28 for the SVM models are for the same window size <italic toggle="yes">ws</italic> = 13. Correspondingly, we select this window size to implement the APOD predictor.

      <title>3.2 Predictive performance of considered features-based sequence representation</title>
      <p>We convert the input protein sequence into a vector of features, which includes both the protein-level features and the local sliding window-based features. The former group covers the protein-level DisCon. The latter includes four major sub-types: the AAC, the conservation-based features (CONS), features extracted from the putative structural characteristics that cover SS and RSA (SS+RSA) and the sliding window-based disorder features (SWdis). We quantify the predictive power of these feature groups by computing the distribution of their PBC values on the training set TR166 (Section 2.4 defines PBC; see <xref rid="btaa808-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Among the window-based features, we observe that the local window-level conservation (CONS) and both the window-level (SWdis) and the protein-level disorder (DisCon) are the most predictive. Correlations computed for some of these features are above 0.1, with some as high as 0.41 (SWdis). We note that DFLpred did not use neither DisCon nor CONS features (<xref rid="btaa808-B36" ref-type="bibr">Meng and Kurgan, 2016</xref>), both of which provide strong predictive quality.

      </fig>
      <p>We also analyze the distribution of the DisCon values across the proteins in the TR166 set. We find that over half of the DFL proteins have &lt;29% disordered residues while over 77% IDPs without DFLs have over 30% disordered residues (see <xref rid="btaa808-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). These substantial differences taken together with the average PBC = −0.412 for the DisCon feature (<xref rid="btaa808-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), support our conclusion that the putative protein-level DisCon is a strong predictive marker for DLFs.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>3.3 Ablation study</title>
      <p>We quantify contributions of the different input feature groups to the APOD predictor by comparing APOD with its versions where only one specific feature group is used (<xref rid="btaa808-F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). This experiment is based on the 5-fold cross validation on the training set TR166 and relies on the parametrized SVM model. Our empirical results reveal that CONS provides the strongest contribution to the APOD predictor. The corresponding SVM model that uses CONS secures AUC = 0.74 AUC and MCC = 0.29. The SWdis-based SVM model provides the second-best predictive quality by obtaining AUC = 0.56 and MCC = 0.04. Moreover, the DisCon-based SVM model performs poorly. This can be explained by the fact that this protein-level future is constant across all residues in a given protein. Thus, while it can differentiate between DFL and non-DFL proteins (<xref rid="btaa808-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), it cannot accurately differentiate DFL and non-DFL residues in a given protein (<xref rid="btaa808-F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). Interestingly, combining the WSdis and DisCon features (the local window- and the protein-level disorder-based features) leads to the predictive model that substantially outperforms the SWdis-based SVM model. The corresponding Dis-based SVM model secures AUC = 0.69 (versus 0.56 when only WSdis features are used) and MCC = 0.11 (versus 0.04). This demonstrates that SVM effectively combines multiple feature groups that reflect different aggregation of the input information (window versus protein level).

        <graphic xlink:href="btaa808f4" position="float"/>
      </fig>
      <p>We note that virtually all features groups provide an above-random contribution to the prediction of DFLs, i.e. they secure AUC &gt; 0.5 and MCC &gt; 0.01 (<xref rid="btaa808-F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The only exception is the DisCon feature by itself, for the abovementioned reasons, which when combined with WSdis provides strong predictive power. This motivates our approach to combine all feature groups together. The corresponding complete APOD model that uses all five feature groups achieves AUC = 0.81 and MCC = 0.38 on the training set TR166 (see <xref rid="btaa808-F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The improvements of the APOD model over the best-performing single feature group model (CONS) are substantial. The AUC increases by (0.81–0.74)/0.74 = 9.2% while the MCC increases by (0.38–0.29)/0.29 = 31%. We conclude that the input feature groups that we designed provide complementary information and using them together leads to accurate prediction of DFLs.</p>

      <title>Comparison with the DFLpred predictor</title>
      <p>To the best of our knowledge, the only other method that predicts DFLs is DFLpred (<xref rid="btaa808-B36" ref-type="bibr">Meng and Kurgan, 2016</xref>). We therefore compared the predictive quality of APOD against DFLpred on the independent (sharing low similarity with the training set TR166) test dataset TE82.</p>
      <p>APOD secures AUC = 0.816 and MCC = 0.418 (<xref rid="btaa808-F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). These results arguably show that the APOD’s predictions are very accurate. Moreover, they are very similar to the results from the cross validation on the training dataset (0.816 versus 0.810 and 0.418 versus 0.382). This is not surprising since the optimization of the underlying SVM model is geared towards ensuring that the model generalizes well to the out-of-sample (non-training set) data. Our empirical result suggests that APOD provides very accurate and similar levels of the predictive performance irrespective of the dataset used.

        </caption>
        <graphic xlink:href="btaa808f5" position="float"/>
      </fig>
      <p>Side-by-side comparison of APOD with DFLpred reveals that the former model provides substantially higher levels of predictive performance (<xref rid="btaa808-F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). More specifically, the APOD’s Pre and Rec are (0.512–0.337)/0.337 = 52% and (0.512–0.179)/0.179 = 186% higher compared with DFLpred, respectively. This means that APOD’s rate of correct DFL predictions is higher by 52% while our predictor also identifies 186% more DFL residues. Moreover, APOD provides (0.418–0.145)/0.145 = 180% improvement in MCC and (0.816–0.637)/0.637 = 28% increase in AUC when compared with DFLpred. Statistical tests (Section 2.5 provides details) reveal that the improvements in the predictive performance between APOD and DFLpred are significant, with <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value = 0.004 for MCC and 0.002 for AUC. Moreover, the APOD’s ROC curve is consistently and by a large margin above that of the DFLpred’s curve (<xref rid="btaa808-F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). This shows that the abovementioned improvements are consistent across the entire range of the FPRs.</p>
      <p>Altogether, our empirical analysis reveals that APOD provides accurate DFL predictions and that it outperforms the existing DFLpred method by a large margin. This can be explained by the many innovations that we introduced in our model, compared with the DFLpred model. They include inclusion of the features extracted from the conservation and putative structural properties of the input sequence, integration of the protein-level information, which helps to differentiate DFL and non-DFL proteins, and use of a well-parametrized SVM model.</p>

      <label>3.5</label>
      <title>Comparison with indirect approaches to predict DFLs</title>
      <p>We also consider comparison with other, indirect ways to predict DFLs. They could be potentially identified using disorder predictors (since they are disordered), methods that predict domain boundaries (since some of the DFLs link domains), and flexibility predictors (since they are flexible). Therefore, we consider the latest protein domain predictor FUpred (<xref rid="btaa808-B71" ref-type="bibr">Zheng <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>) and one of the latest flexibility predictors, PredyFlexy (<xref rid="btaa808-B11" ref-type="bibr">de Brevern <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). We also compare against a selection of popular disorder predictors including DISOPRED3 (<xref rid="btaa808-B25" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Cozzetto, 2015</xref>) and IUPred2A (<xref rid="btaa808-B39" ref-type="bibr">Meszaros <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>), the latter in two of its versions that focus on the prediction of long and short IDRs. We also consider combining the disorder and flexibility predictions, given that DFLs possess both characteristics. To do that, we simply multiply the putative flexibility and disorder propensities generated by PredyFlexy and each of the disorder predictors, respectively. We note that the domain predictor FUpred is limited to proteins with &lt;1500 residues and that the flexibility predictor PredyFlexy does not provide predictions for the first and last 10 residues in a protein chain. Therefore, we had to exclude the 3387 residues long DP01931 protein and the first and the last 10 residues of each of the remaining 81 test proteins from the TE82 dataset for the purpose of this assessment.</p>
      <p><xref rid="btaa808-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarizes the comparative assessment for APOD and the eight indirect predictors. The FUpred domain predictor achieves AUC = 0.637 and MCC = 0.162, which reveals that the use of the putative domains produces modest levels of predictive performance. This is expected since some DFLs are localized between domains; however, the inter-domain linkers cannot be captured with this approach. These predictions are significantly worse than the results produced by APOD (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value = 0.004 for AUC and 0.003 for MCC; Section 2.5 defines the corresponding statistical test). The MCC and AUC values produced by APOD improve by 162% and 29% over FUpred, respectively. We also note a wide and consistent, over the entire range of FPR values, margin of improvement between the ROC curve of APOD and that of FUpred (see <xref rid="btaa808-F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).

      <p><xref rid="btaa808-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> also compares APOD to several popular disorder predictors and the flexibility predictor. The predictor of the flexible residue PredyFlexy secures AUC = 0.574 and MCC = 0, which point to a near-random predictive quality. These results are significantly worse that the predictions by APOD (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value = 0.0003 for AUC and 0.006 for MCC). This can be explained by the fact that DFLs are disordered while flexibility prediction concerns flexible but structures residues. The disorder predictors also perform poorly with the best AUC = 0.514 and best MCC = 0.002 for IUPred2A short (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value = 0.0001 for AUC and 0.004 for MCC when compared with APOD). This is because they predict all disordered residues, instead of focusing specifically on DFLs. The combinations of the flexibility and disorder predictions, which are covered at the bottom of Table, secure the best AUC = 0.557 and the best MCC = 0.059. This result corresponds to the solution that combines PredyFlexy with IUPred2A short, and is again significantly outperformed by APOD (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value = 0.0001 for AUC and 0.003 for MCC). The corresponding ROC curves are shown in <xref rid="btaa808-F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>.</p>
      <p>We conclude that all considered here indirect approaches to predict DFLs are significantly worse than APOD and could not be used to reliably identify the DFLs.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>We conceptualize, develop and test a novel and APOD. This method predicts DFL regions directly from the input protein sequence using a two-step process. First, we convert the sequence into an information-rich profile that represents selected structural properties including CONS and putative (sequence derived) SS, solvent accessibility and intrinsic disorder. Second, we encode this profile into a carefully designed feature set that we input into the well-parametrized SVM model to generate the DFL predictions. The features that we generate rely on the new (to this area) information source (CONS and putative structure) and include an innovative protein-level information. We empirically show that the inclusion of the protein-level features leads to substantial improvements (gray bars in <xref rid="btaa808-F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). This can be explained by the fact that these features can effectively differentiate between proteins with DFLs and proteins that do not include DFLs. Empirical comparison with the existing predictor of DFLs, DFLpred, reveals that these innovations leads to statistically significant improvements in the predictive quality. APOD offers AUC and MCC values that are higher by 28% and 180%, respectively, when compared against DFLpred on the independent/low-similarity test dataset. The improvements are even more substantial when compared again several approaches that can be used to indirectly predict DFLs.</p>
    <p>We provide a free access to the APOD predictor via a convenient webserver located at <ext-link xlink:href="https://yanglab.nankai.edu.cn/APOD" ext-link-type="uri">https://yanglab.nankai.edu.cn/APOD</ext-link>. This webserver performs all computations on the server side and requires the FASTA-formatted protein sequence as the only input. The results are delivered directly in the web browser window and are also sent to the user’s email address, if provided.</p>
    <p>Given the high predictive quality of APOD and availability of the convenient to use webserver, we believe that our tool will find significant interest among researchers that study dynamics and functions of the disordered proteins and protein domains.</p>
