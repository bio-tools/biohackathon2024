    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>Modern microbial genomic approaches utilize a combination of genomic technologies and bioinformatics tools to directly retrieve the genetic content of entire communities of organisms. Methods based on aligning sequencing reads to large databases of micro-organism genome references continue to illuminate the true microbial composition of deep sequenced biological samples. However, a limitation of such reference alignment-based analyses is that candidate pathogens may have limited identity to micro-organisms with sequenced genomes. To overcome this limitation, we pioneered the identification of novel non-human sequences (putative pathogens) in a comprehensive and unbiased manner using a ‘computational subtraction’ approach (<xref rid="bty501-B2" ref-type="bibr">Bhatt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bty501-B7" ref-type="bibr">Kostic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bty501-B15" ref-type="bibr">Weber <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). This approach relies on the removal of host reads and analysis of the non-host portion of reads, resulting in the detection of both known and novel pathogens as well as any resident micro-organisms. Other methods for identifying novel micro-organisms in sequencing data from host organisms include digital transcript subtraction (<xref rid="bty501-B5" ref-type="bibr">Feng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), Pathoscope (<xref rid="bty501-B6" ref-type="bibr">Francis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), SURPI (<xref rid="bty501-B12" ref-type="bibr">Naccache <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) and VirusSeq (<xref rid="bty501-B4" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p>
    <p>We present an updated implementation of the PathSeq pipeline (<xref rid="bty501-B7" ref-type="bibr">Kostic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) that makes substantial improvements on the original version. First, computational efficiency has been improved by incorporating faster computational approaches (Materials and Methods Section). Second, unlike the original version, Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) PathSeq permits users to configure the workflow for multiple use cases such as different library types (i.e. whole-genome and RNA sequencing), sample types (e.g. blood, tissue, sputum, etc.), or host species. Third, the tool suite is implemented in Java with the GATK engine (<xref rid="bty501-B11" ref-type="bibr">McKenna <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>) and Apache Spark framework (<xref rid="bty501-B16" ref-type="bibr">Zaharia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), enabling parallelized data processing on local workstations, computing clusters and Google Cloud computing services (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cloud.google.com">https://cloud.google.com</ext-link>).</p>
  </sec>
  <sec>
    <title>2 Materials and methods</title>
    <p>PathSeq begins with removal of low quality, low complexity, host-derived and duplicate reads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material S1</xref>). Several methodological improvements have been made to these steps in order to improve performance. Apache Spark is used to process batches of sequencing reads asynchronously in memory, thus maximizing resource utilization and minimizing slow hard-disk operations between pipeline stages. To accelerate filtering of low-complexity sequences, the RepeatMasker step (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.repeatmasker.org/">http://www.repeatmasker.org/</ext-link>) has been replaced with the symmetric DUST algorithm (<xref rid="bty501-B10" ref-type="bibr">Morgulis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). To rescue reads that are partially informative, the new version also incorporates trimming of low-quality bases, sequencing adapter artifacts and low-complexity sequences. The reads are then subjected to a fast <italic>k</italic>-mer search using a Bloom filter (<xref rid="bty501-B3" ref-type="bibr">Bloom, 1970</xref>) to detect short sequences from the host reference. Reads containing at least one host <italic>k</italic>-mer (<italic>k</italic> = 31) are removed. This step typically subtracts ∼90% of the host reads prior to performing sequence alignment, thus greatly reducing run time. The BLAST (<xref rid="bty501-B1" ref-type="bibr">Altschul <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>) aligner has been replaced with the faster BWA-MEM aligner (<xref rid="bty501-B8" ref-type="bibr">Li, 2013</xref>), which is used to map the remaining reads to the host reference (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p>
    <p>PathSeq then aligns the remaining non-host reads to a reference of microbial genomes (viruses, bacteria, fungi, etc.; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) and classifies each read taxonomically. Alignment efficiency is again improved using BWA-MEM. Classification specificity has been increased by running the aligner in paired-end mode and requiring that both reads in a pair map to the same organism during classification. Finally, a report is generated containing microbial abundance estimates at each taxonomic level (e.g. species, genus, family, etc.).</p>

    <title>3 Results</title>
    <p>We used two datasets to demonstrate the performance of GATK PathSeq: (i) a total RNA sequencing library from HeLa cervical cancer cell line (<xref rid="bty501-B7" ref-type="bibr">Kostic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) and (ii) mRNA and WGS sequencing libraries from a cervical cancer patient (SGCX-NOR-030; <xref rid="bty501-B13" ref-type="bibr">Ojesina <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). The cloud computing environment used for this study are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material S2</xref>. A cutoff of 70% sequence identity was used for microbial read classification; this cutoff can be set by the user.</p>
    <p>The HeLa library (10.3 million high-quality 76 bp paired-end reads) was used as a positive control and compared to the earlier PathSeq version. GATK PathSeq identifies 38 350 reads, comprising 0.37% of the library, aligned to HPV-18 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>), compared with the original PathSeq pipeline, which identified 25 879 HPV-18 reads (<xref rid="bty501-B7" ref-type="bibr">Kostic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). While we did not identify the cause of this increase, it may be due to improvements in the completeness of the microbe reference, read quality filtering and host read subtraction methodology. GATK PathSeq also reveals 4078 unmapped reads, or approximately 0.04%. The total CPU time taken for the analysis is 0.8 h.</p>
    <p>The mRNA and WGS libraries derived from patient SGCX-NOR-030 contained approximately 218 million (76 bp) and 1.58 billion (101 bp) paired-end reads, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material S3</xref>). These libraries were available as BAM files aligned to a human reference. Mapped reads were filtered before running PathSeq, reducing each library size by an order of magnitude. After quality filtering and host subtraction, the SGCX-NOR-030 mRNA and WGS samples contain 23 803 non-host reads and 2.2 million non-host reads including 1.7 million bacterial reads, respectively. GATK PathSeq identifies HPV-16 as the predominant HPV strain in SGCX-NOR-030 mRNA and WGS samples with read counts of 1984 and 9882 reads, respectively. This finding is consistent with previously published data (<xref rid="bty501-B13" ref-type="bibr">Ojesina <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). The identity cutoff does not substantially affect the number of detected HPV reads, which only decreases by up to 13% if the identity cutoff is raised from 60% to 90% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). Note that in both samples HPV-16 reads comprise &lt;0.01% of the input reads and &lt;0.001% of the original libraries, demonstrating PathSeq’s ability to detect extremely low abundance organisms. Residual unmapped reads were 12 215 (∼0.006% of the original reads) from the SGCX-NOR-030 mRNA library and 453 423 (∼0.03%) from the SGCX-NOR-030 WGS library (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). The total CPU time taken for analysis is approximately 2.3 h for the mRNA sample and 6.7 h for the WGS sample. Processing of large libraries scales efficiently in cluster environments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>).</p>
    <p>Using a BLAST search, 36% of the unmapped reads of the HeLa library, 28% of the SGCX-NOR-030 mRNA library and 11% from the WGS library could be identified. These consisted primarily of human, HPV, bacteria, fungi and microbial eukaryote sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S6</xref>) not represented in the PathSeq reference. Assembly of the unmapped reads using Fermi-lite (<xref rid="bty501-B9" ref-type="bibr">Li, 2015</xref>) yielded little further insight into the identity of these sequences in the HeLa and SGCX-NOR-030 mRNA libraries. However, in the SGCX-NOR-030 WGS library, 11 of the 20 largest assembled contigs mapped to <italic>Sphingomonadaceae</italic>, indicating the possible presence of a novel bacterium from this family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S7</xref>). Understanding these residual unmapped reads will help us to improve GATK PathSeq and will also provide insight into the completeness of the human reference genome and the sequencing quality control process.</p>
    <p>In summary, we have developed an adaptable and easily configurable pipeline for identification of microbial sequences in next generation sequencing data. This tool allows for customized analyses of biological samples with substantially reduced computational time.</p>
