      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>With the study of human diseases and biological processes increasing, a large number of non-coding variants have been identified and facilitated. The rapid accumulation of genetic and epigenomic information has resulted in an urgent need to collect and process data to explore the regulation of non-coding variants. Here, we developed a comprehensive variation annotation database for human (VARAdb, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.licpathway.net/VARAdb/">http://www.licpathway.net/VARAdb/</ext-link>), which specifically considers non-coding variants. VARAdb provides annotation information for 577,283,813 variations and novel variants, prioritizes variations based on scores using nine annotation categories, and supports pathway downstream analysis. Importantly, VARAdb integrates a large amount of genetic and epigenomic data into five annotation sections, which include ‘Variation information’, ‘Regulatory information’, ‘Related genes’, ‘Chromatin accessibility’ and ‘Chromatin interaction’. The detailed annotation information consists of motif changes, risk SNPs, LD SNPs, eQTLs, clinical variant-drug-gene pairs, sequence conservation, somatic mutations, enhancers, super enhancers, promoters, transcription factors, chromatin states, histone modifications, chromatin accessibility regions and chromatin interactions. This database is a user-friendly interface to query, browse and visualize variations and related annotation information. VARAdb is a useful resource for selecting potential functional variations and interpreting their effects on human diseases and biological processes.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Recent advances in high-throughput technologies, such as DNA sequencing and genome-wide association studies (GWAS), have generated a flood of data associating variants with complex human diseases and phenotypes (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). These variants often lie far from known genes, presumably in transcriptional regulatory regions, such as distal enhancers, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and accessible chromatin regions (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Several studies have shown that disease-associated variants were significantly enriched in regulatory elements that are dispersed widely across the genome. Many variants such as rs1198588, rs4442975 and rs117480515 have been found to affect TF binding sites within regulatory regions and regulate gene expression (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref>). Furthermore, variants nearby or located in enhancers were found to disrupt enhancer–promoter loop resulting in disease and gene expression dysregulation (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6–9</xref>). For instance, rs4442975, a strong candidate for causality, flanks a transcriptional enhancer that physically interacts with the promoter of <italic>IGFBP5</italic>. Researchers have demonstrated that rs4442975 is associated with <italic>FOXA1</italic> binding and the low expression of <italic>IGFBP5</italic> increased breast cancer susceptibility. In colorectal cancer, risk SNP rs6983267 was found to increase <italic>TCF7L2</italic> binding and enhancer activity to regulate <italic>c-MYC</italic> expression (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Therefore, annotation and analysis of non-coding variants can help to explain GWAS results and understand the genetic structure of diseases. Importantly, integrating variations with genetic and epigenomic information, and long-range interactions will help to select causal regulatory variants and understand underlying regulatory mechanisms in biological processes.</p>
    <p>In recent years, several databases and web tools have been developed to annotate non-coding variants based on genetic and epigenomic information (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12–15</xref>). HaploReg (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and rSNPBase (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) are both useful databases for annotating cataloged variants. Different from HaploReg and rSNPBase, RegulomeDB can interrogate the regulatory information of novel variants by using a scoring system (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). These non-coding variant databases and web tools have provided effective platforms and available data for variant exploration. However, a flood of genomic datasets, such as enhancers, super enhancers, TFs, accessible chromatin regions and chromatin interactions, is accumulating rapidly, which promotes an urgent need to integrate and process the data for variants comprehensively and effectively. In particular, TFs from ChIP-seq data and motif changes of variants should be further provided. In addition, providing a strategy and regulatory network for variants based on genomic data will help researcher to prioritize potential functional variants in complex diseases. Fortunately, ENCODE (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), the Roadmap Epigenomics project (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), and UCSC (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), as well as other comprehensive data sources, have uncovered the landscape of massive regulatory elements in the genome. In addition, chromosome conformation capture (3C)-based technologies, Hi-C (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19–21</xref>), ChIA-PET (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and 5C (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), have provided increased datasets of chromatin interactions and revealed patterns on how regulatory elements regulate the expression of their target genes (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Together, to integrate, prioritize and analyze variation-associated information, building a human variation annotation database is necessary. VARAdb will help to explore the regulatory mechanisms of variations and discover casual variations, which may accelerate the development of variation research.</p>
    <p>To this end, we developed a comprehensive VARiation Annotation database for human (VARAdb, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.licpathway.net/VARAdb/">http://www.licpathway.net/VARAdb/</ext-link>), which is focused on providing a large number of variations and annotating their potential roles with various regulatory information, in particular, non-coding variants are considered. The current version of VARAdb cataloged a total of 577 283 813 variations and provided five annotation sections: ‘Variation information’, ‘Regulatory information’, ‘Related genes’, ‘Chromatin accessibility’ and ‘Chromatin interaction’. The genetic and epigenomic data involved motif changes, risk SNPs, linkage disequilibrium (LD) SNPs, eQTLs, clinical variant-drug-gene pairs, sequence conservation, somatic mutations, enhancers, super enhancers, promoters, TFs, chromatin states, histone modifications, ATAC accessible regions and chromatin interactions. Moreover, the database collected two types of variation-related genes: (i) variation related genes based on whether the variation is located in an enhancer or not (if it is, the variation may associate with enhancer target genes predicted by Lasso method) and (ii) variation-related genes based on distance including overlapping genes, proximal genes and the closest gene. In addition, to perform the in-depth analysis of variations, VARAdb was designed to prioritize variations based on score, annotate novel variants and provide pathway downstream analysis. VARAdb is a user-friendly database to query, browse and visualize information associated with variations. We believe that VARAdb could become a useful and effective platform for exploring potential functions and regulation of variations in human diseases and biological processes.</p>

Human eQTL data were downloaded from GTEx v7 (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), PancanQTL (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) and HaploReg v4.1 (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). We downloaded and processed significant SNP–gene pairs in 48 human tissues from GTEx v7. For each eQTL pair, we annotated eQTL with ‘rsID’ according to ‘chr_position_ref_alt_b37’ and provided not only ‘Gene_ID’ but also ‘Gene_name’. Finally, we obtained 16 489 663 eQTL pairs (with false discovery rate, FDR ≤ 0.05, including 3 052 986 SNPs and 18 126 genes). From PancanQTL, we first obtained a large number of cis-eQTL pairs from 33 cancer types, then added three valuable statistical values to 5 596 894 cis-eQTL pairs (with FDR ≤ 0.05, 1 370 558 SNPs and 17 353 genes). At the same time, we collected 4 613 715 eQTL pairs (914 358 SNPs and 20 331 genes) in different tissues from HaploReg v4.1.</p>

Moreover, biologists need to obtain various genetic and epigenomic information of the novel variants they want to explore. To strengthen the practical application of novel variants, we have designed ‘Novel variant annotation’ to provide five annotation sections, where the information includes accessible chromatin, chromHMM state, histone modification, TF, chromatin interaction, super-enhancer, promoter, gene, eQTL, GWAS, somatic mutation and SNV (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">B</xref>).

After submitting, VARAdb will identify significantly enriched pathways, downstream TFs, common SNPs located in TF binding regions, and common SNP-associated genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2J</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). The enriched pathways are calculated using a hypergeometric test with the following formula:<disp-formula id="M2"><label>(2)</label><tex-math id="M4">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <title>Case study</title>
      <p>To illustrate the usage of VARAdb, we searched the database with a well-studied variation rs2279590 (chr8:27456253:T&gt;C, score = 6) by inputting the ‘rsID’ or its genomic location (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>). The variation was associated with age-related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>). We will validate the key predictions of the variation using VARAdb by collecting experimental data from studies. Notably, after clicking ‘rsID’ in the output table that first displayed the summary annotation information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>), the details page exhibited an overview of rs2279590, variation–gene–enhancer network, and five annotation sections (variation information, regulatory information, related genes, chromatin accessibility and chromatin interaction) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>). From ‘Variation information’ and ‘Related genes’, as a Risk SNP, rs2279590 was annotated as a genetic risk factor of AD and reported to regulate gene expression of <italic>CLU</italic>, which was consistent with studies of GWAS information (<xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>,<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>). We found that <italic>CLU</italic> was the related gene of rs2279590 because <italic>CLU</italic> was not only the closest gene of rs2279590 but also an eQTL gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>, left panel), which was validated by the experimental results of Padhy <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>). From ‘Regulatory information’, we found that rs2279590 was located in an enhancer of AD. Moreover, rs2279590 was enriched in super enhancers where <italic>CLU</italic> is the closest active gene. In addition, rs2279590 was associated with many histone marks such as H3K4me1 and H3K27ac as well as accessible chromatin regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>, middle panel), which are in line with some studies (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>). More importantly, the relationship between <italic>CLU</italic> and rs2279590-associated super enhancers was further validated by chromatin loops according to Hi-C and ChIA-PET data in the ‘Chromatin intersection’ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>, right panel).</p>
      <p>The relationship between variation and TF is crucial to transcriptional regulation and worth detecting. From motif change data of ‘Variation information’, rs2279590 was predicted to strongly affect the binding of three TFs including <italic>NFATC1</italic>, <italic>RFX1</italic> and <italic>SREBF1</italic>. These TFs were regulated by other functional features such as receptors associated with AD (<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88–90</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>, left panel). For instance, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors open channel blocker memantine is used to treat AD, which correlates with a reduction in T-cell receptor (TCR)-induced Ca(2+) mobilization and nuclear localization of <italic>NFATC1</italic> (<xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). From the TF ChIP-seq data of ‘Regulatory information’, VARAdb displayed rs2279590-associated TF binding information based on ChIP-seq data, which is an effective high-throughput experiment strategy for validating TF binding results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>, middle panel). We found that 14 out of 26 rs2279590-related TFs were reported to be associated with AD, these were <italic>CEBPA</italic>, <italic>E2F6</italic>, <italic>EP300</italic>, <italic>ERG</italic>, <italic>ETS1</italic>, <italic>FOS</italic>, <italic>GATA2</italic>, <italic>IKZF1</italic>, <italic>NR4A1</italic>, <italic>RUNX1</italic>, <italic>SPI1</italic>, <italic>SPIB</italic>, <italic>TCF7L1</italic> and <italic>WT1</italic> (<xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91–104</xref>). For example, lower expression of TF <italic>SPI1</italic> reduces AD risk by regulating myeloid gene expression and cell function (<xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>). We also found that TF <italic>MAX</italic> was associated with AD but not reported by in existing studies. <italic>MAX</italic> was enriched in AD-related Gene Ontology terms such as DNA binding and protein binding based on relevant results from ENSEMBL (<xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>). In addition, these 14 TFs can be used to identify rs2279590-related pathways. After performing the ‘Pathway downstream analysis’, the output table showed that the ‘ERK cascade’, ‘Glucocorticoid receptor regulatory network’, and ‘Regulation of Androgen receptor activity’ were significantly enriched. Above all, these results showed the usefulness and value of VARAdb in exploring the potential function and regulation of variation.</p>
      <p>Risk SNP rs6983267 (chr8:128413305:G&gt;T, score = 6) was used as another example to access VARAdb. The variation is associated with colorectal cancer pathogenesis. After searching rs6983267, users can obtain various annotation results in the details page (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2A, B</xref>). We found that rs6983267 was predicted to affect the binding of TF <italic>JUND</italic>, which was further validated in HCT116 (sample type: cell line, tissue: colon) by TF ChIP-seq data from ‘Regulatory information’ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2C</xref>, left panel). In colorectal cancer, rs6983267 was associated with <italic>MYC</italic>. Indeed, VARAdb identified <italic>MYC</italic> as a variation-related gene and enhancer-related target gene, which was consistent with previous studies (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Notably, Wright <italic>et al.</italic> has presented evidence that the risk region harboring rs6983267 physically interacts with the <italic>MYC</italic> oncogene in colorectal cancer and rs6983267 binds to <italic>TCF7L2</italic> (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In addition, an in vivo study by Sur <italic>et al.</italic> has reported that deletion of the enhancer region, including rs6983267, results in resistance to intestinal tumors (<xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>). Interestingly, we found that rs6983267 was not only located in some super enhancers and typical enhancers identified by H3K27ac ChIP-seq data in colon relevant tissue and cell type, but also in many chromatin regions with the H3K4me1 mark (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2C</xref>, middle panel), as well as accessible regions in cholangiocarcinoma from ATAC-seq data of ‘Chromatin accessibility’ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2C</xref>, right panel). A study by Wright <italic>et al.</italic> validated the predictions involving rs6983267, where this variation had enhancer-related histone marks such as H3K4me1 and was located in enhancers that form a 335-kb chromatin loop to interact with the <italic>c-MYC</italic> promoter (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In addition, we also found that rs6983267 was associated with <italic>PCAT1</italic> which was not reported in existing studies. In VARAdb, <italic>PCAT1</italic> is an overlapping gene of rs6983267, which was reported to correlate with <italic>MYC</italic> (<xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>). Moreover, GWAS data and other studies (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) showed that <italic>MYC</italic> was a rs6983267-associated gene. Therefore, these results suggest that VARAdb could explore the potential function and regulation of genes that are related to the variation.</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>Expanding the functional datasets collected and integrating them across more effective resources will improve the functional predictions of non-coding variants in human complex diseases and phenotypes (<xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>). The genetic and epigenomic information, as well as chromatin interactions, are important for interpreting the roles of non-coding variants enriched in various regulatory elements (<xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>). Compared with the existing databases (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>), VARAdb focuses on the comprehensive annotation of a large number of variations and massive regulatory annotation information. VARAdb not only provides annotation for the cataloged variations but also the novel ones. The current version of VARAdb cataloged a total of 577 283 813 variations which are ∼three times more than similar databases and provided five annotation sections including ‘Variation information’, ‘Regulatory information’, ‘Related genes’, ‘Chromatin accessibility’, and ‘Chromatin interaction’, with significantly more information than similar databases (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p>

    <p>VARAdb has rich annotations, scoring strategy, regulatory element information and useful analysis tools. Furthermore, VARAdb provides a user-friendly interface to browse, search, analyze, and visualize information about variations. Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, which compares VARAdb with other databases for information and functions, shows the advantages of VARAdb. We provide: (i) the annotation of 577 283 813 variations; (ii) the scores for 577 283 813 variations (range from 0 to 9) based on the annotated records of nine annotation categories: risk SNP, eQTL, motif change, conservation, enhancer/super enhancer, promoter, TF binding, ATAC accessible region and Hi-C; (iii) five annotation sections of variation, each of which contains detailed annotation information; (iv) online analysis tools including ‘Novel variant annotation’ and ‘Pathway downstream analysis’; (v) user-friendly visualization of genomic information of variants linking to the UCSC genome browser by adding multiple tracks; (vi) five search paths to access variation; (vii) user-friendly browsing; (viii) detail pages containing different charts for relationships between variations, risk SNPs, enhancers, genes and TFs.</p>
    <p>VARAdb supports annotating the cataloged and novel variations in many categories. In the process of developing the database, we considered this matter. Because there are many data sources, we designed multiple sections and data modules for effectively managing updates in a modular way. This will effectively ensure the controllability of data and improve the efficiency of updating the database. Specifically, we designed five annotation sections: ‘Variation information’, ‘Regulatory information’, ‘Related genes’, ‘Chromatin accessibility’, and ‘Chromatin interaction’. For each section, we divided many sources of the same or similar characters into a group, which is an independent module. In other words, each module contains several data sources shown by a drop-down menu in the database. Because the stored information is based on the module of five sections, we can control the quality of data and ensure that VARAdb is user-friendly and effective. We developed a workflow for updating the database (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). When updating each data source, the quality of data will be controlled according to the modular process. If a series of requirements are met, the data source will be updated and the score of variation may be also calculated again (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). In the future, the sources of the annotation data may accumulate rapidly. Therefore, we will continue to collect available resources, process these data to enrich the regulatory information and provide a new scoring strategy based on TF binding sites, eQTLs, enhancers and super enhancers, ATAC accessible regions and Hi-C considering tissue/cell-specific features. Moreover, we will add new methods of analysis in VARAdb such as upstream analysis. VARAdb will help users to predict the function of variation and provide perspectives of variation regulation.</p>
