    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>The accurate segmentation of a microscopy image into single cells is an important preprocessing step for many image analysis pipelines (<xref rid="btz402-B10" ref-type="bibr">Meijering, 2012</xref>). As a model organism, the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> is often used in imaging experiments, some of which can generate tens of thousands of images (<xref rid="btz402-B5" ref-type="bibr">Dubreuil <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="btz402-B8" ref-type="bibr">Koh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="btz402-B11" ref-type="bibr">Riffle and Davis, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="btz402-B14" ref-type="bibr">Weill <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). To analyze these images, a range of segmentation options have emerged, often tailored to specific datasets. Some integrate assumptions specialized to screens, such as the presence of fluorescent markers (<xref rid="btz402-B6" ref-type="bibr">Handfield <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), edge patterns (<xref rid="btz402-B4" ref-type="bibr">Dimopoulos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="btz402-B13" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>), or assumptions specific to microfluidics experiments (<xref rid="btz402-B1" ref-type="bibr">Bakker <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Others require the laborious specification of many manual parameters (<xref rid="btz402-B2" ref-type="bibr">Carpenter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>); indeed, most methods for brightfield images require extensive parameter tuning for optimal performance (<xref rid="btz402-B12" ref-type="bibr">Versari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p>
    <p>For a cell biologist, the wide choice and complexity of segmentation methods may lead them to manual quantification if the effort required for automation appears disproportionate to the scale of their experiments. We envisioned a tool that could produce reasonable segmentations for most images with minimal effort. Toward this goal, we designed YeastSpotter (yeastspotter.csb.utoronto.ca), a web application that generalizes to images from different microscopes and imaging modalities, without the need to specify any parameters: the user simply submits their images and obtains a segmentation. Despite its simple use, we obtain comparable performance to specialized state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks for segmentation of both fluorescent and brightfield images.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec>
    <title>2 Materials and methods</title>
    <p>Our underlying segmentation method is based upon transferring publicly available convolutional neural networks from the 2018 Kaggle Data Science Bowl competition. In this competition, contestants trained models to segment images of mostly human nuclei, using image set BBBC038v1 from the Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection (<xref rid="btz402-B9" ref-type="bibr">Ljosa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) as training data. Despite not being trained on yeast cells, we found that these models transferred well without fine-tuning. We used a pre-trained mask-RCNN model (<xref rid="btz402-B7" ref-type="bibr">He <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) by the third-place winner, the Deep Retina team, which we chose due to its simplicity and easily extensible code. To make this model more accessible to the community, we implemented YeastSpotter as a web application to run images through this model.</p>
    <p>To use YeastSpotter, the user simply uploads their image, which redirects them to a page that tracks the progress of their request and produces segmentation results once ready. A preview image on the result page shows the outlines of the segmentation overlaid on the original input. The user can then download the segmentation, which is stored as an integer-signed tiff file (pixels with a value of 0 correspond to the background, while pixels belonging to each unique cell are each assigned a different integer value). On the website, we provide instructions for loading these fines into ImageJ and scripts to read them in Python, Matlab and R.</p>
    <p>YeastSpotter is intended for low-throughput use and only accepts a single image per request. For batch segmentation, we also provide user-friendly Python code (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.github.com/alexxijielu/yeast_segmentation">www.github.com/alexxijielu/yeast_segmentation</ext-link>).</p>
  </sec>
  <sec>
    <title>3 Results</title>
    <p>To understand the accuracy and run-time of the segmentations produced by our method, we used a set of 4305 ellipses manually drawn around yeast cells in fluorescent micrographs (<xref rid="btz402-B6" ref-type="bibr">Handfield <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). We compared segmentations from YeastSpotter to previously reported results for segmentation software specially designed for this dataset by Handfield <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="btz402-B6" ref-type="bibr">Handfield <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), and for segmentations obtained through CellProfiler (<xref rid="btz402-B2" ref-type="bibr">Carpenter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) in <xref rid="btz402-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, using parameters previously optimized by Chong <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="btz402-B3" ref-type="bibr">Chong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). These results suggest that our method segments fluorescent micrographs of yeast cells more accurately than established methods, with no manual tuning of parameters.

    <p>We report the percent of manual ellipses with a matched single-cell segmentation within ten pixels, the mean and standard deviation of distance (in pixels) between the centers of the manual ellipse and segmentation, the correlation between their areas and the time (in seconds) to process the evaluation image set (68 images).</p>
    <p>To test the generalization capacity, we evaluated our segmentations on detecting cell centers in brightfield images from the Yeast Image Toolkit benchmark (<xref rid="btz402-B12" ref-type="bibr">Versari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). We achieved comparable performance to most tools, even though they have been extensively optimized for brightfield images (<xref rid="btz402-B12" ref-type="bibr">Versari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), while YeastSpotter was not. We note that YeastSpotter does not achieve state-of-the-art performance, so expert users may still want to optimize tools for their images.</p>
    <p>We next qualitatively examined segmentation results on these (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="btz402-F1">Fig. 1</xref>) and other image modalities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref> shows differential interference contrast (DIC) and phase contrast). On fluorescent images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="btz402-F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), CellProfiler (with parameters used for <xref rid="btz402-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) under-segments bud cells, grouping the pixels of bud cells with mother cells and does not accurately detect the boundaries of cells with dim vacuoles. Accurately segmenting bud cells is critical for understanding yeast biology, as it permits for the study of the cell-cycle (<xref rid="btz402-B6" ref-type="bibr">Handfield <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). YeastSpotter and the method of Handfield <italic>et al.</italic> more reliably separate bud cells from mother cells.

      </caption>
      <graphic xlink:href="btz402f1"/>
    </fig>
    <p>However, as the method of Handfield <italic>et al.</italic> is engineered for fluorescent images, it fails to generalize to the segmentation of brightfield images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="btz402-F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The CellProfiler segmentation optimized for fluorescent micrographs is more robust, but still produces many errors, identifying parts of the background as cells and over-segmenting some cells. YeastSpotter performs well on both fluorescent and brightfield images; there are some errors with overlapping or out-of-focus cells in the brightfield images, but most cells are segmented well.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec>
    <title>4 Conclusion</title>
    <p>Here, we introduced a user-friendly and generalizable web application for the segmentation of yeast microscopy images. We produced high-quality segmentations for both fluorescent and brightfield images using the same model and parameters. These results suggest that YeastSpotter is highly general, as opposed to most previous methods, which have been developed to segment images of a particular type.</p>
    <p>YeastSpotter may not outperform carefully optimized methods tailored to specific problems. However, for users without the time or expertise to fine-tune or compare specialized methods, our method offers excellent off-the-shelf performance.</p>
