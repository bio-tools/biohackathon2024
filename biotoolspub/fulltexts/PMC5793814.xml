      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>We develop a hierarchical pipeline, ThreaDomEx, for both continuous domain (CD) and discontinuous domain (DCD) structure predictions. Starting from a query sequence, ThreaDomEx first threads it through the PDB to identify multiple structure templates, where a profile of domain conservation score (DC-score) is derived for domain-segment assignment. To further detect DCDs that consist of separated segments along the sequence, a boundary-clustering algorithm is used to refine the DCD-linker locations. In case that the templates do not contain DCDs, a domain-segment assembly process, guided by symmetry comparison, is applied for further DCD detections. ThreaDomEx was tested a set of 1111 proteins and achieved a normalized domain overlap score of 89.3% compared to experimental data, which is significantly higher than other state-of-the-art methods. It also recalls 26.7% of DCDs with 72.7% precision on the proteins for which threading failed to detect any DCDs. The server provides facilities for users to interactively refine the domain models by adjusting DC-score threshold, deleting and adding domain linkers, and assembling domain segments, which are particularly helpful for the hard targets for which current methods have a low accuracy while human-expert knowledge and experimental insights can be used for refining models. ThreaDomEX server is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/ThreaDomEx">http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/ThreaDomEx</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Protein domains are subunits that can fold and evolve independently. The majority of eukaryotic proteins are found to consist of multiple domains for achieving various composite cellular functions (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The identification of protein domains is thus the essential step for protein structure determination and functional annotations, where a variety of computational methods have been proposed to divide proteins into domains from the amino acid sequences (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p>
    <p>One of the earliest and still widely used approaches is homologous modeling, which predicts protein domain boundaries through the identification of the evolutionarily conserved sequence families from multiple homologous sequence alignments. Examples that use such approach include Pfam (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), PASS (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), EVEREST (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), ADDA (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and FIEFDom (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Another popularly used approach obtains domain predictions through the statistical modeling or machine leaning trained from known domain structures in the PDB library. These include, for example, DGS (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), Armadillo (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), DPD (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), DomCut (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), CHOPnet (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), Dompro (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), DomNet (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), PPRODO (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), kemaDom (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), DLP-SVM (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), DROP (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), H-DROP (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), DOBO (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), and the methods proposed by Galzitskaya and Melnik (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and Tanaka <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). There are also methods, such as SnapDRAGON (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), RosettaDom (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and OPUS-DOM (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), which first construct 3D models through <italic>ab initio</italic> folding and then extracted domain information directly from the structure prediction. Recently, we proposed a new method, ThreaDom (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), which deduces the domain boundary information from multiple query-to-template alignments derived by meta-server threading programs (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p>
    <p>Most of the methods can only generate predictions for continuous domains (CDs) that consist of continuous residues along the query sequence, while a large number of proteins contain discontinuous domains (DCDs). For example, the current PDB library deposits about 18% proteins with at least one DCD which consists of two or more non-sequential segmental sequences (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The detection and correct division of the DCDs represents a major challenging problem. The 3D-model based methods, such as SnapDRAGON (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), RosettaDom (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), OPUS-DOM (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), can in principle split the predicted 3D models into DCDs, but the success rate of <italic>ab initio</italic> structure predictions is very low (if not impossible) for the proteins of DCDs which usually have a medium to large size (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). ThreaDom (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) can break up the size limit due to the adoption of threading-based template recognition technique, but the success relies on the existence of similar DCD structure in the threading template library. DomEx (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) was recently proposed to predict DCDs by the reassembly of DCD segments guided with homology and symmetry alignments, which is able to detect DCDs beyond the structures in the template library and therefore significantly increases the accuracy of the DCD predictions.</p>
    <p>Despite of the high number of method proposed, the number of on-line webservers available to biological community for automated domain prediction is quite low. Among the limit on-line servers, DOBO (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) generates domain boundary prediction by integrating evolutionary signals and machine learning. DomCut (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) collects linker preference profiles along the sequence with the domain boundary position predicted as the minima of the profiles. Scooby-domain (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) creates domain number and boundary predictions from the length and hydrophobicity analyses. The server by Galzitskaya and Melnik (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) generates fast domain boundary estimations based on chain entropy and amino acid composition. DLP-SVM (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), H-DROP (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and DROP (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) provide domain linker positions and probability of the predictions based on SVM training. Finally, the ThreaDom server (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) uses multiple threading alignments and domain conservation score profiles to generate domain boundary assignments, which have witnessed successful applications in various 3D structure predictions (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) and structure-based function annotation studies (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).</p>
    <p>Here, we propose a new domain prediction server, ThreaDomEx, which combines the ThreaDom and DomEx methods into a unified and user-friendly on-line server system for efficient structural domain predictions. Compared with many of the existing servers, one of the major novelties of ThreaDomEx is the enhanced ability to predict the DCD structures, mainly through the incorporation of the DomEx algorithm that assembles non-consecutive domain segments following multiple threading template alignments. Meanwhile, considerable efforts have been made to provide advanced visualization facilities, which, for the first time, allows users to conveniently integrate the human-expert knowledge and experimental insight to improve the domain prediction results of the sever pipelines.</p>

      <title>Method overview</title>
      <p>The pipeline of ThreaDomEX for protein domain prediction consists of three consecutive steps (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). When a user uploads an amino acid sequence, the query is first threaded through a representative structure library of the PDB by LOMETS (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) to identify homologous and analogous structural templates. Meanwhile, PSSpred (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) and MUSTER (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) are employed to generate secondary structure and solvent accessibility predictions for further domain structure analyses. Secondly, a domain conservation score (DC-score) is calculated from the multiple threading template alignments to evaluate the conservativeness of each of the residues, where the initial boundaries of domain segments are decided on the distribution of DC-score along the sequence (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Finally, a boundary-clustering based strategy is used to fine-tune the boundary positions, as well as to detect the DCDs from the templates. If no DCD is detected from the LOMETS templates, a segment assembly process guided by symmetric motif comparison, as proposed in DomEx (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), is employed for further detection of DCD structures.</p>

          <p>Flowchart of ThreaDomEx. The query sequence is first threaded through a representative PDB structure library to search for structural templates. Domain Conservation score (DC-score) is then calculated to evaluate the conservativeness of each amino acid in the query, with the domain boundaries assigned around the valley of the DC-score profile. Next, a boundary clustering-based strategy is used to optimize the boundary predictions and to detect discontinuous domains (DCDs). Finally, a symmetric alignment based segment assembly algorithm is employed for further DCD detection when no DCD was detected in the threading templates.</p>

      <p>The on-line server system is constructed on a three-layer architecture of front-end, server-end and business logic layer. The front-end of server is implemented with HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, bootstrap CSS and D3.js to preprocess the input data from the user submission and display the domain prediction results. The server-end is developed with PHP, Mysql and Perl for data persistence and constructing output pages. The business logic layer implements the backstage modeling calculations based on the ThreaDom and DomEx programs.</p>

      <title>Datasets and assessment criterions</title>
      <p>Two independent datasets (Test-I and Test-II) were constructed to evaluate the performance of ThreaDomEX on the domain boundary prediction and DCD detection, respectively. The Test-I set contains 630 non-homologous proteins, which include 315 single-domain, 245 two-domain, 57 three-domain, and 13 four- or higher-order-domain proteins; the Test-II set has 481 non-redundant and multi-domain chains, which include 326 chains containing DCDs and 155 chains with only CDs. Each protein chain in Test-II has at least three segments, with segment length &gt;40 residues. None of the testing proteins are homologous to any of the proteins that are used for training the ThreaDomEx program. To further rule out homology contamination, all the templates that have a sequence identity &gt;30% to the query or are detectable by PSI-BLAST with an <italic>E</italic>-value &lt;0.05 have been excluded in the threading template library.</p>
      <p>The true domain boundaries of the test proteins are defined based on the CATH3.4 database (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). A predicted boundary is considered as correct if it is located with <inline-formula><tex-math id="M31">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <title>Domain boundary prediction on Test-I</title>
      <p>The ability of domain boundary prediction is tested on the Test-I dataset, where ThreaDomEx correctly classifies the target sequences as being single- or multi-domain proteins in 81% of the cases. For the 522 ‘Easy’ proteins in which LOMETS has a higher confidence score, the average accuracy of classification is 84.7%, and for the rest of the 108 ‘Hard’ proteins, the accuracy is 68.5%. We also used the NDO-score, which is defined as the normalized overlap rate of all predicted domain and linker regions with the true assignments of the query structure (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), to evaluate the domain boundary prediction. The average NDO-score for the ‘All’, ‘Easy’ and ‘Hard’ targets is 0.893, 0.905 and 0.832, respectively. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> lists the NDO-score of ThreaDomEX, in control with that by the five publicly available domain predictor programs, including FIEFDom (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), DomPro (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), DROP (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and PPRODO (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), on the same set of testing proteins. These programs represent a representative set of methods on homology and machine learning based approaches, where the data demonstrates the advantage and efficiency of the threading-based domain predictions on accurately assigning the protein domain locations.</p>

      <p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> summarizes the NDO-score of ThreaDomEx with the other control programs for the 481 proteins from the Test-II dataset. Here, only ThreaDomEx and ThreaDom have the ability to detect DCDs, while the major difference between these two programs is that ThreaDomEx exploits DomEx to detect DCDs when ThreaDom does not detect any DCDs. Although the NDO-score of ThreaDomEx (0.759) is only slightly higher than ThreaDom (0.750), ThreaDomEx could recall 26.7% of the DCDs with 72.7% precision on the subset that ThreaDom failed to detect any DCDs, indicating that segment alignment and assembly process by DomEx can indeed help identify DCDs beyond template-based transferals.</p>
      <p>To further examine the impact of the segment-assembly based DCD detection on the domain boundary prediction, we construct two hybrid methods that combine DomEx with the best two boundary predictors ThreaDom_Bdr and FIEFDom, denoted as ThrDm_Bdr+DomEx and FIEFDom+DomEx, respectively. ThrDm_Bdr represents a truncated program of ThreaDom that uses the DC-score profile to predict the domain boundaries but turns off the clustering-based boundary optimization and DCD detection. The results in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> shows that the inclusion of DomEx can improve the NDO-score of both programs, demonstrating a positive impact of the segment-assembly based DCD detection on the overall domain boundary prediction. But the ThreaDomEx pipeline, which includes the entire process of multiple threading, domain refinements, and segment-assembly based DCD detection, has a higher accuracy than all these testing programs.</p>

      <title>ThreaDomEx on a public dataset</title>
      <p>In addition to the tests on the two internal datasets, we applied ThreaDomEx on a publically available dataset at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://web.tuat.ac.jp/%E2%88%BCdomserv/cgi-bin/LinkerList.txt">http://web.tuat.ac.jp/∼domserv/cgi-bin/LinkerList.txt</ext-link>, which was previously used by Ebina <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). This dataset contains 206 proteins, with 174 two-domain, 24 three-domain and 8 four-domain proteins. Under a similar homologous template filter, i.e. excluding all templates with an identity identity &gt;30% to the query or detectable by PSI-BLAST with an <italic>E</italic>-value &lt;0.05 from the threading library, we obtained the domain boundary prediction with the average sensitivity and specificity being 0.795 and 0.601, respectively, compared to the true domain assignments. These values are significantly higher than the randomly domain assignments, which have the sensitivity and specificity being 0.221 and 0.262, respectively, calculated by Ebina <italic>et al</italic>. by randomly selecting a 11-residue window from the non-terminal region as the domain linker (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The ThreaDomEx results also compare favorably to that by several other sequence-based predictors reported by Ebina <italic>et al.</italic>, including DLP-SVM (sensitivity/specitificity = 0.597/0.436) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and Armadillo (0.486/0.342) (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). But it should be noted that the dataset that Ebina <italic>et al</italic>. used (containing 182 proteins) is slightly smaller than what we used here, which may account for part of the differences of the results between ThreaDomEx and these methods.</p>

    <title>CONCLUSION</title>
    <p>We developed a new on-line server system, ThreaDomEx, for efficient and user-friendly protein domain prediction, which was built on the multiple threading template alignments followed by domain boundary clustering and segment reassembly. Compared to traditional sequence homology and machine-learning based approaches, the threading based domain assignment, guided by a domain conservation scoring profile, achieves a significantly higher domain division accuracy, as shown in the large-scale benchmark tests. In particular, a segment assembly algorithm is introduced to enhance accuracy of both domain boundary prediction and DCD detection, which makes ThreaDomEx one of the very few on-line systems equipped with the ability to model DCD structures beyond template-based domain transferals.</p>
    <p>The pipeline of the ThreaDomEx is fully automated. However, the overall accuracy of domain prediction can be low for the non-homologous hard proteins and those with DCDs, where the human-expert knowledge and insights from experimental data or biological function analyses will become valuable for further improving the automated domain prediction results. Considerable effort has been made to enable users to interactively edit and refine the domain predictions; these include the facilities to manually tune the DC-score threshold, delete and add domain linkers, and merge and assemble different domain segments. In addition to the final modeling results, various intermediate modeling data, including the DC-score profile, secondary structure and solvation prediction, and multiple threading template alignments, have been made available and visualizable, which not only help users to manually improve the domain predictions, but also provide valuable information to assist further structure prediction and function annotation studies for the submitted sequences.</p>
