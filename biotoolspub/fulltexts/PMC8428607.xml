        <p>Cancer dependencies provide potential drug targets. Unfortunately, dependencies differ among cancers and even individuals. To this end, visible neural networks (VNNs) are promising due to robust performance and the interpretability required for the biomedical field.</p>

        <title>Results</title>
        <p>We design Biological visible neural network (BioVNN) using pathway knowledge to predict cancer dependencies. Despite having fewer parameters, BioVNN marginally outperforms traditional neural networks (NNs) and converges faster. BioVNN also outperforms an NN based on randomized pathways. More importantly, dependency predictions can be explained by correlating with the neuron output states of relevant pathways, which suggest dependency mechanisms. In feature importance analysis, BioVNN recapitulates known reaction partners and proposes new ones. Such robust and interpretable VNNs may facilitate the understanding of cancer dependency and the development of targeted therapies.</p>

    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>Precision medicine aims to improve therapy based on individual patient and disease variations. In cancer, a promising approach is to target treatment on specific genetic vulnerabilities, which encode mechanisms essential to the survival and proliferation of cancer cells. Genetic dependencies differ among cancers and individuals, unfortunately, requiring resource-intensive experimental approaches [e.g. CRISPR screening (<xref rid="btab137-B7" ref-type="bibr">Dempster <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019b</xref>; <xref rid="btab137-B24" ref-type="bibr">Meyers <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>)] to map them. As these experiments are impractical to conduct on every patient, algorithmic methods to pinpoint dependencies may accelerate a general approach to discover cancer essential genes for personalized therapeutic targeting.</p>
    <p>One possible approach is deep learning (i.e. neural networks; NNs). It has been useful in biological applications, such as to predict sequence specificities of DNA- and RNA-binding proteins (<xref rid="btab137-B1" ref-type="bibr">Alipanahi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>) and to classify clinical images (<xref rid="btab137-B10" ref-type="bibr">Esteva <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Despite robust performance, however, these models are like black boxes. Their parameters are difficult to interpret due to their complex and nonlinear relationship with the output (<xref rid="btab137-B9" ref-type="bibr">Eraslan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). While model interpretability is not uniformly crucial, it is highly desired in biomedical applications, to guide both clinicians and patients to make well-reasoned medical decisions.</p>
    <p>To improve interpretability, recent studies sought to encode biological knowledge directly into the architecture of the NN. This led to parameters and output states that represent biological entities or subsystems (<xref rid="btab137-B9" ref-type="bibr">Eraslan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="btab137-B36" ref-type="bibr">Yu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). These models were named visible neural networks (VNNs; <xref rid="btab137-B23" ref-type="bibr">Ma <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) as opposed to the traditional, black box NN whose parameters are not interpretable. For example, <xref rid="btab137-B23" ref-type="bibr">Ma <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2018)</xref> used Gene Ontology (<xref rid="btab137-B33" ref-type="bibr">The Gene Ontology Consortium, 2017</xref>) and Clique-eXtracted Ontology (<xref rid="btab137-B16" ref-type="bibr">Kramer <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) to design the architecture of an NN model, DCell, for predicting yeast cell growth given gene deletion genotypes. The same group further extended the model to predict drug responses and synergy (<xref rid="btab137-B17" ref-type="bibr">Kuenzi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). <xref rid="btab137-B20" ref-type="bibr">Lin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2017)</xref> and <xref rid="btab137-B28" ref-type="bibr">Peng <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2019)</xref> embedded protein–protein interactions, protein–DNA interactions and Gene Ontology into VNNs that reduce the dimensions of single-cell RNA-seq data. <xref rid="btab137-B8" ref-type="bibr">Eetemadi and Tagkopoulos (2019)</xref> used the transcriptional regulatory network to build the architecture of the genetic NN to predict gene expression. These examples suggest that VNNs perform as well or better than traditional NNs and other non-NN methods while providing interpretable models/predictions. However, signaling pathway information has not yet been used to design VNN.</p>
    <p>Pathways [e.g. Reactome (<xref rid="btab137-B11" ref-type="bibr">Fabregat <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>)] summarize how some biological components work together to relay upstream signals downstream and biochemically transform molecules through orchestrated series of reactions. Such pathways (<xref rid="btab137-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) can be viewed as a hierarchy of interconnected modules that integrate signals and process responses, not unlike an NN architecture (<xref rid="btab137-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Therefore, such pathway information may naturally fit well to build VNNs models that better reflect biological and cellular systems.</p>

(<bold>B</bold>) A BioVNN designed based on pathway information in (A). The information from nodes in previous layers is integrated in a node of the next layer only if two nodes are connected. The input layer nodes (genes) are connected to the hidden layer nodes (pathways) only when the gene is in that pathway. The input consists of RNA features and deletion status (see Section 2). Lower-level pathways are further connected to higher-level pathways for integrating information toward the prediction of gene dependency. BioVNN is sparsely connected opposed to (<bold>C</bold>) traditional fully connected feedforward network</p>

    <p>As a test, VNNs might help deconvolute cancer dependencies where, besides their performance, they could advance the understanding of the internal states of biological systems by linking predictions to underlying mechanisms represented by pathways (<xref rid="btab137-B36" ref-type="bibr">Yu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). However, to our knowledge, VNNs have not been utilized to predict cancer dependencies to improve the model interpretability and accelerate precision medicine.</p>
    <p>To that end, we develop here <underline>Bio</underline>logical <underline>V</underline>isible <underline>N</underline>eural <underline>N</underline>etwork (BioVNN), an interpretable model, to predict the dependencies of potentially druggable genes for cancer cells with RNA expression features. Crucially, the architecture design of BioVNN reflects domain expert-curated signaling pathways, Reactome (<xref rid="btab137-B11" ref-type="bibr">Fabregat <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Just as convolutional layers combine pixel information of spatial relationships, BioVNN integrates modular information on gene pathways; the neuron units are sparsely connected by following the pathway knowledge (<xref rid="btab137-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). We compare BioVNN to a matched random gene group model and to a fully connected network (FCN), and find that even with fewer training cycles, it significantly outperforms the former and slightly outperforms the latter, which has 193 times more parameters in five-fold cross-validation. In a time-stamp experiment, BioVNN outperforms random group model when predicting future observations from prior data. Besides this robust performance, BioVNN predictions can also be explained by the neuron states of specific pathways. The pathway states are different between dependent and nondependent cells and such difference specifically exists only when the gene of target variable is in the pathways. On closer examination, strikingly, BioVNN learns to overweight the feature genes in the same reactions as the genes of target variable, even though such reaction information is never explicitly provided in training data or model. In addition, greater feature weights may suggest novel reaction components. In summary, BioVNN embeds Reactome pathways to predict gene dependency in cancer cells and also provide interpretable neuron states that suggest a rationale for the predictions. By improve our understanding of cancer dependency, this robust and interpretable model is a step toward faster development of precision medicine.</p>

      <title>2.1 Data collection and preprocessing</title>
      <sec>
        <title>2.1.1 Pathway data</title>
        <p>To design BioVNN from pathway information, the pathways gene set file (*.gmt), pathway hierarchy relationship file, and reaction file were downloaded from Reactome (<xref rid="btab137-B11" ref-type="bibr">Fabregat <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) (<ext-link xlink:href="https://reactome.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://reactome.org</ext-link>) on May 29, 2019. To ensure that the pathway information was useful, we selected just those 1,425 pathways (including the root) with at least five genes which are feature genes (which expression profiles are used as the model input) and/or genes in the target variable (which dependency predicted in the model output). They consist of total 9,501 genes. The reaction file provides more detailed gene–gene relationship information within a pathway, e.g. binding, activation, translocation, degradation and biochemical events. We test whether the trained models could recapitulate these reaction relationships as validation.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>2.1.2 RNA expression features and dependency target variables</title>
        <p>We downloaded CCLE RNA expression data of cancer cell lines (<xref rid="btab137-B12" ref-type="bibr">Ghandi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>) and CRISPR data of cancer cell lines (<xref rid="btab137-B7" ref-type="bibr">Dempster <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019b</xref>; <xref rid="btab137-B24" ref-type="bibr">Meyers <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) of 19Q3 and 20Q2 versions from DepMap (<ext-link xlink:href="https://depmap.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://depmap.org</ext-link>). In total, 609 cell lines in 19Q3 and 142 different cell lines newly added in 20Q2, which have both expression and CRISPR data, were used.</p>
        <p>The expression data are RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) log2-transformed TPM (transcripts per million) values, using a pseudo-count of 1. To select feature genes, we first only considered those with values greater than 1 in at least 1% of the cell lines (i.e. 7 cell lines). Then, we further narrowed our choice to genes present in Reactome. This yielded 9488 genes as RNA expression features.</p>
        <p>The CRISPR screening measures the knockout effects of around 18,000 genes on cancer cell growth and the more significant effects represent higher dependencies. The dependency probabilities (between 0 and 1) were used to set up a classification problem of interests, i.e. a gene has a significant effect on a cell line, as suggested on the DepMap webpage: samples with dependency ≥0.5 were defined as the positive class (target variable = 1) and the samples with dependency &lt;0.5 were defined as the negative class (target variable = 0).</p>
        <p>To choose genes as target variables (which dependencies were predicted in the model output) we first selected genes that exist in both Reactome and CRISPR data. Then, to focus on genes with sufficient data for training and potential druggabilities, we further restricted our choice to a final set of 683 genes with (i) at least six positive samples; (ii) at least six negative samples; (iii) at least one druggable gene category and at least one chemical interaction in DGIdb (which records drug–gene interactions and potentially druggable genes) (<xref rid="btab137-B5" ref-type="bibr">Cotto <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) (v3.0.2). Note also that we excluded genes which were either nearly all dependent or nearly all nondependent across cell lines as they could lead to overestimates and inaccurate performance evaluation.</p>

      <title>2.2 BioVNN design</title>
      <p>Like the convolutional layers combining pixel information based on spatial relationship and forming higher-level abstraction in deeper layers, BioVNN layers integrate information based on gene–pathway and pathway–pathway relationships and simulate the representations of higher-level pathways in deeper layers. We hypothesize that NNs only need to integrate the information of the genes/pathways which are functionally related to predict dependency. In other words, we specifically look for the correlation among RNA expression and deletion status of all genes in the same pathway and the correlation among pathways having the same parents. Hence, the first hidden layer of lowest-level pathways selectively connects those input genes in the same pathways to the same neuron units, which look for the combinatory effects of expressed and knocked-out genes on cell growth/death. Then, it sends the integrated information to the neurons of corresponding parent pathways until reaching the root. These are important distinctions between BioVNN and FCNs. BioVNN selectively integrates the input based on pathway knowledge, whereas FCNs integrate all information from the previous layer (<xref rid="btab137-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Code and data are available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/LichtargeLab/BioVNN" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/LichtargeLab/BioVNN</ext-link>.</p>
      <p>The input of BioVNN consists of two parts (<xref rid="btab137-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The first part is the RNA gene expression profile of the cell line. The second part is the deletion status that specifies which gene is ‘knocked-out’ to simulate its effect on the cell line, inspired by DCell (<xref rid="btab137-B23" ref-type="bibr">Ma <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). With the architecture mimicking the 13-level hierarchy of 1,425 Reactome pathways, BioVNN predicts the dependency of the gene in the cell line specified in the input. Conceptually, BioVNN could be viewed as a sparsely connected feedforward network of 13 hidden layers (<xref rid="btab137-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

      <title>2.4 Time-stamped experiment</title>
      <p>To test performance in the most realistic context, we ran time-stamped experiments. We used the models trained on data from DepMap 19Q3. Then we applied these models to predict the dependency for 142 cell lines that were added in 20Q2. To be noted, some cell lines have data in both releases. Even if using 20Q2 data for both training and testing could potentially reduce batch effects affecting the performance, we used the data solely from 19Q3 for training and the data solely from 20Q2 for testing. In this case, it tests the robustness of the model to handle variations from different data versions. One gene, FCGR1A, only exists in 19Q3 but not in 20Q2 dependency data. So only 682 target variable genes were tested in this experiment. The Pearson’s correlation of dependency between 19Q3 and 20Q2 is 0.996 in 609 overlapping cell lines and 682 overlapping genes. The Pearson’s correlation of RNA expression between 19Q3 and 20Q2 is 1.0 in 609 overlapping cell lines and 9488 overlapping genes. It shows slight variations between two data versions.</p>

      <title>3.1 BioVNN predicts cancer dependencies in potentially druggable genes</title>
      <p>Because we aimed to predict drug targets, we trained the model to predict cancer dependencies for potentially druggable genes in five-fold cross-validation (see Methods). As a baseline, we first calculated the performance while making prediction based on the expression values because the expression levels have been shown to be correlated with the dependency (<xref rid="btab137-B6" ref-type="bibr">Dempster <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019a</xref>). However, our results showed that at least for these druggable genes we selected, the correlation is low (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.32; Supplementary Fig. 1) and the performance is almost random (AUROC = 0.527; AUPRC = 0.256). For model comparison, we used the matched fully connected network (Fig. 1C) which has the same number of neurons in each hidden layer and the same depth as BioVNN. To examine whether the Reactome-based architecture is useful for predicting gene dependency, we generated the matched random gene group model by shuffling the gene-pathway and pathway-pathway relationship as a control (see Supplementary Methods). In the five-fold cross-validation, Figure 2A and 2B showed that overall BioVNN (AUROC = 0.883; AUPRC = 0.754) marginally outperforms the FCN (AUROC = 0.879; AUPRC = 0.740) but, significantly, converges with one third fewer training cycles (i.e., epochs; Fig. 2C; Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon (MWW) test two-sided <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 5.9E−03) and 193 times fewer trainable parameters (Fig. 2D). In addition, BioVNN also outperforms the random gene group model (AUROC = 0.845; AUPRC = 0.688) with 21% fewer epochs (Fig. 2C; MWW test two-sided <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 5.9E−03). Interestingly, in the experiments of gradually increasing randomized network connections, we found that AUPRC decays faster than AUROC (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, random sparsity may lead to worse performance. Overall, these data suggest that Reactome pathways provide non-random gene group information which facilitates the training of neural networks and the prediction of cancer dependencies.</p>
      <p>Because the FCN has similar performance despite much more parameters, we suspected whether those additional model weights converged to zeroes after training. First, we compared the model weights of first layer to BioVNN and found that FCN has a distribution significantly more enriched at zeroes comparing to BioVNN (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 1E−16; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), which suggests that BioVNN uses much fewer parameters but with higher averaged absolute values of weights (∼0.03) to retain similar amount of information in the data. Next, we asked whether those parameters in FCN connect the feature genes of the same pathway to the same computing neuron, which may rediscover the pathways. Because those neurons in FCN cannot be mapped to pathways directly, we formulated gene groups by applying <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-means clustering (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic> = 826, the number of the pathways in the first layer of BioVNN) to the PCA-compressed model weights. We found that, surprisingly, 353 out of 826 (42.7%) of gene groups overlapped significantly [hypergeometric test adjusted <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.1 using BH method (<xref rid="btab137-B2" ref-type="bibr">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>)] with at least one Reactome pathways. We further generated random gene groups matching the sizes of gene group generated based on FCN in 1,600 simulations and found the probability to reach 353 overlapping groups is less than 1E−200 given the simulated exponential distribution (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement Fig. 3</xref>). The results suggest that the parameters of FCN integrate the gene group information that is similar to Reactome pathways used by BioVNN. In addition, FCN also used other ways of integrating gene information, which may imply new gene groups that are also important for predicting cancer dependency.</p>

      <title>3.2 BioVNN predicts dependencies in newer data release</title>
      <p>To test predictions prospectively, we setup time-stamped experiments using the training/test dataset from different data releases. We trained the BioVNN on data from DepMap as of 19Q3 (August 2019) and then evaluated its performance over 142 new cell lines that were added later, in the 20Q2 version (May 2020). To be clear, no data from 20Q2 were used for training and 20Q2 data were used for testing. This tests whether the model is robust across data versions given potential batch effects and variations.</p>
      <p><xref rid="btab137-F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows that, as before, BioVNN marginally gains on the FCN (MWW test two-sided <italic toggle="yes">P &gt; </italic>0.09) and outperforms the random gene group model for both AUROC and AUPRC (MWW test two-sided <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 8.0E−03). Again, the results suggest that the pathway knowledge embedded in the BioVNN is helpful to predict cancer dependency. More importantly, by validating the ability of BioVNN to predict dependency prospectively, these data show that BioVNN is generalizable to future data releases.</p>

      <title>3.3 The neuron states of BioVNN simulate pathway states</title>
      <p>Besides performance, interpretability is an essential characteristic of BioVNN. By encoding the Reactome hierarchy, the hidden layers of BioVNN can represent actual signaling pathways whereas traditional NNs or random group models cannot. To determine whether BioVNN’s hidden layers, representing pathways, make predictions more interpretable, we aimed to study why the model made a prediction. More specifically, we investigated three hypotheses. (1) Because the gene dependency is supposed to be affected by its pathway, we hypothesize that when one group of cell lines is dependent and another one is not dependent on the same gene, the output neuron states (<inline-formula id="IE63"><mml:math id="IM63" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">o</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula>) of the pathways including the same gene from two groups are different. (2) Because other pathways do not include the gene to predict dependency, we hypothesize that we can only find such state difference in only the specific pathways. (3) When one cell line is predicted to be dependent and another one is predicted to be not dependent on the same gene, we hypothesize that the pathway states can suggest key pathways leading to the dependency difference.</p>
      <p>To test the first hypothesis, we took the gene, ITGAV, which is a potential drug target for cancers (<xref rid="btab137-B4" ref-type="bibr">Cheuk <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; van der Horst <xref rid="btab137-B34" ref-type="bibr"><italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), as an example. We compared the ITGAV-involved pathway states of ITGAV-dependent cell lines (which have dependency of ITGAV ≥ 0.5) and nondependent cell lines (which have dependency of ITGAV &lt; 0.5). For visualization, we compressed the neuron states of ITGAV-involved pathways by principal component analysis and plotted the first two components with kernel density estimation (<xref rid="btab137-F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). As an example, the states of the pathway, ‘Neutrophil degranulation’ (R-HSA-6798695), showed significantly different distributions between two classes (i.e. ITGAV-dependent and non-ITGAV-dependent cell lines) (<xref rid="btab137-F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A;</xref> combined MWW test two-sided <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 4.7E−17; see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>). We found that 26 out of 27 ITGAV-involved pathways show significantly different neuron states between the two classes [combined MWW test two-sided adjusted <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.1 using Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) method (<xref rid="btab137-B2" ref-type="bibr">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>)]. As a result, the difference of ITGAV dependency could be explained by the state difference of ITGAV-involved pathways.</p>

The class separation was measured by how different the PC1 and PC2 of pathway neuron states are between ITGAV-dependent and non-ITGAV-dependent cell lines (see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>). Twenty-seven ITGAV-involved pathways have significantly higher class separation than 1398 other pathways. ***, MWW test one-sided <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 6.6E−06</p>
        </caption>
        <graphic xlink:href="btab137f4" position="float"/>
      </fig>
      <p>To test the second hypothesis, we examined whether such class differences are observable in all pathways, i.e. nonspecific, or only in related pathways, which contain the target variable gene (ITGAV). We found that such class separation [as measured by the −log<sub>10</sub>(<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>) value] is significantly larger in related pathways than unrelated pathways (i.e. which do not contain the target variable gene) (<xref rid="btab137-F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C;</xref> MWW test one-sided <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 6.6E−06). We further expanded the analysis to other genes, and found that in total 74.3% (396 out of 533 target variable genes involved in at least six pathways) have such significant class separation in related pathways [MWW test one-sided adjusted <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.1 using BH method (<xref rid="btab137-B2" ref-type="bibr">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>)]. That is to say, the dependency differences of the target variable gene between cell lines may be explained by the differences of the neuron states of pathways that contain that target variable gene but not others. Hence, these results suggest that these neuron states could specifically simulate the internal states of pathways in cells and provide explanations for dependency predictions.</p>
      <p>To test the third hypothesis and further explain the dependency prediction, we examined the neuron states from lower-level to higher-level pathways (<xref rid="btab137-F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A and B</xref>). Taking two cell lines, e.g. DKMG (glioma) was predicted to be ITGAV-dependent (<xref rid="btab137-F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>); BL70 (Burkitt lymphoma) was predicted not to be ITGAV-dependent (<xref rid="btab137-F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Given their RNA profiles and the ITGAV deletion vectors as input, the neuron states of their ITGAV-involved pathways look distinct (<xref rid="btab137-F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A and B</xref>), which explains their opposite predictions. In addition, we further clustered them with other cell lines by the PC1 of their neuron states. We found that predicted ITGAV dependency could be explained by the low neuron states of pathways, which include mostly those under Immune System in the Reactome hierarchy, e.g. Neutrophil degranulation, Innate Immune System and Adaptive Immune System, while non-ITGAV dependency could be explained by high neuron states in these pathways. Hence, these data showed that to predict ITGAV dependency, BioVNN simulated ITGAV deletion and pathway states in the model. The different predictions could be interpreted and explained by the differences in Immune System pathways. It also implies that Immune System pathways may play key roles in ITGAV dependency in cancer cells. These results demonstrate that BioVNN’s predictions are interpretable by inspecting the simulated pathway neuron states.</p>

      <title>3.4 BioVNN recovers reaction knowledge and suggests new reaction components</title>
      <p>Finally, we investigated which features are important for the dependency prediction in BioVNN. We utilized the reaction information from Reactome, which was not used in designing models nor training, to validate whether BioVNN found important features that fit biological knowledge. Reaction information groups genes that are involved in a common process, e.g. binding, activation, translocation, degradation and biochemical events. One gene can be involved in multiple reactions, which are typically smaller gene groups than pathways. A pathway thus often consists of multiple reactions to achieve its function. Two genes involved in the same reaction are in the same pathway but not necessarily vice versa. Such reaction relationships between two genes are stronger than pathway relationships. Should one gene be deleted, its reaction partners are more likely to be affected than pathway partners. Therefore, we hypothesized that even in the same pathway, genes involved in the same reaction as the target variable gene would have higher importance than others.</p>
      <p>Taking NFKB1 as an example, we hypothesized that those genes in the same reactions as NFKB1 have higher feature importance in predicting NFKB1 dependency than other genes in the same pathway. NFKB1 is involved in a total of 53 Reactome reactions, which consist of 333 genes that are NFKB1 reaction partners. One NFKB1-involved pathway at the bottom of the hierarchy is a 78-component pathway, ‘Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP)’ (R-HSA-2559582), consisting of 28 NFKB1 reaction partners. We found that surprisingly, those 28 genes and NFKB1 have significantly higher importance (as measured by feature weights; see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>) than the 49 other genes in the same pathway (MWW test one-sided <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 2.9E−06; <xref rid="btab137-F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Taking EP300 as another example, EP300 and the 52 genes that are reaction partners with EP300 also have significantly higher feature importance than the other genes in the 88-gene pathway, ‘Activation of anterior HOX genes in hindbrain development during early embryogenesis’ (R-HSA-5617472) (MWW test one-sided <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 5.0E−04; <xref rid="btab137-F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Furthermore, we expanded the analysis to other target variable genes, and found that 132 out of 1618 gene–pathway pairs (corresponding to 95 of 426 unique genes; see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>) had significantly higher features importance for those genes involved in the same reactions as the target variable gene [MWW test one-sided adjusted <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.1 using BH method (<xref rid="btab137-B2" ref-type="bibr">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>)]. These results demonstrated that the high-importance features in BioVNN are not random and are in agreement with the biological knowledge of reactions. Of note, only pathway information but not reaction information was used to build the BioVNN architecture. These data suggest that BioVNN recovers the reaction knowledge from the training data on its own even if such knowledge is not provided during model construction or training.</p>

      <p>During the analysis above, we found outliers in groups of ‘Other genes’, that were not involved in the same reactions as the target variable gene, that also have high feature importance. In other words, BioVNN regards those genes to be as useful in predicting dependency for the target variable genes as the reaction partner genes. Taking the NFKB1 and SASP pathway as an example (<xref rid="btab137-F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>), the gene of second highest weight in ‘Other genes’ is CDK2, which could suggest a new reaction component with NFKB1. Indeed, a previous study showed that NF-κB bound to the promoter of CDK2, turned on its transcription and upregulated the protein level of CDK2 (<xref rid="btab137-B21" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). In the example of EP300 (<xref rid="btab137-F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>), the gene of highest weight in ‘Other genes’ is HOXD4, which we propose as a reaction component with EP300. In fact, the protein interaction between HOXD4 and p300 has already been reported (<xref rid="btab137-B30" ref-type="bibr">Shen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>) but is not yet documented in the Reactome database. These findings suggest that genes with high feature importance, that are not reaction partners with the target variable gene, could be candidate reaction components, which have either not been discovered nor added in Reactome database.</p>

    <title>4 Discussion</title>
    <p>Robust and interpretable models are crucial for biomedicine, so we aimed to investigate how pathway knowledge can design VNNs for predicting and interpreting cancer dependency. We have demonstrated the ability of BioVNN to successfully predict cancer gene dependencies and provide interpretable predictions. While converging faster, BioVNN not only significantly outperforms matched random group model but also marginally outperforms the FCN that has 193 times more parameters. BioVNN is also generalizable to predict dependency for cell lines in future releases of the DepMap dataset. By examining the case of ITGAV and overall analysis, we showed that only related pathways have distinct neuron states between dependent and nondependent cell lines whereas most other pathways do not. Specifically, ITGAV dependency could be explained by the low states of pathways related to immune system.</p>
    <p>This work illustrates how biological knowledge of signaling pathways can be integrated into an NN architecture. Not only does it solve the issues of designing NN architectures, but also it provides a mechanistic explanation of predictions. For future applications of this work to precision medicine, the RNA-seq expression data of patients could be used to predict personalized cancer dependent genes.</p>
    <p>The novel application of signaling pathways to design VNNs was proven to be useful for the first time. In addition, BioVNN uniquely utilizes the pathway-guided feature masks and deletion status vectors to achieve two innovations: (1) training based on bulk RNA-seq data from only hundreds of human cell lines and (2) dependency prediction of hundreds of genes in single model. Given these innovations, a future direction would be to apply VNNs to other cell line data to predict and explain important questions like synthetic lethality and drug responses. The <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> states of VNNs could further explain the <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> observations of cell line screenings to synergistically accelerate the development of precision medicine. With more development and validation in the future, these VNNs could be used to predict personalized drug targets and drugs <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> for each patient with interpretable models to explain the predictions and guide their therapies providing better understanding of treatment mechanism.</p>
    <p>This study could be expanded in a few ways. First, other biological knowledge could also be embedded in the VNNs, due to the fact that Reactome contains around 10 000 genes, which is only about half of the human protein-coding genes and might limit performance. Many other pathway databases [e.g. Pathway Commons (<xref rid="btab137-B29" ref-type="bibr">Rodchenkov <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>), KEGG (<xref rid="btab137-B15" ref-type="bibr">Kanehisa and Goto, 2000</xref>), MSigDB (<xref rid="btab137-B19" ref-type="bibr">Liberzon <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>) and PANTHER (<xref rid="btab137-B25" ref-type="bibr">Mi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>)] could be added to increase the coverage of genes as well as pathway knowledge. In addition, the gene group information can also be nonhuman-curated, such as the gene groups detected from biological networks by computational algorithms (<xref rid="btab137-B3" ref-type="bibr">Cantini <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="btab137-B35" ref-type="bibr">Wilson <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Since those gene groups are not curated by human, they can be less biased and provide novel functional gene groups.</p>
    <p>Second, the model could incorporate more features of cell lines. One possibility is to integrate other types of genomics data besides RNA expression, such as DNA mutation (<xref rid="btab137-B12" ref-type="bibr">Ghandi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>), DNA methylation (<xref rid="btab137-B12" ref-type="bibr">Ghandi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>), copy number variation (<xref rid="btab137-B12" ref-type="bibr">Ghandi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>) and protein expression (<xref rid="btab137-B27" ref-type="bibr">Nusinow <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). These multiple biological observations of the same gene from different angles could be modeled as one state and then be used as features for predicting phenotypes. Another possibility is to incorporate other biological entities [e.g. noncoding RNAs (<xref rid="btab137-B12" ref-type="bibr">Ghandi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>) and metabolites (<xref rid="btab137-B18" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>)]. In both ways, the states of the cells could be simulated more precisely and completely.</p>
