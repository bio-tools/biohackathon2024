      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Most cell type-specific genes are regulated by the interaction of enhancers with their promoters. The identification of enhancers is not trivial as enhancers are diverse in their characteristics and dynamic in their interaction partners. We present Esearch3D, a new method that exploits network theory approaches to identify active enhancers. Our work is based on the fact that enhancers act as a source of regulatory information to increase the rate of transcription of their target genes and that the flow of this information is mediated by the folding of chromatin in the three-dimensional (3D) nuclear space between the enhancer and the target gene promoter. Esearch3D reverse engineers this flow of information to calculate the likelihood of enhancer activity in intergenic regions by propagating the transcription levels of genes across 3D genome networks. Regions predicted to have high enhancer activity are shown to be enriched in annotations indicative of enhancer activity. These include: enhancer-associated histone marks, bidirectional CAGE-seq, STARR-seq, P300, RNA polymerase II and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Esearch3D leverages the relationship between chromatin architecture and transcription, allowing the prediction of active enhancers and an understanding of the complex underpinnings of regulatory networks. The method is available at: <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/InfOmics/Esearch3D" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/InfOmics/Esearch3D</ext-link> and <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7737123" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7737123</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>The non-coding genome contains a diverse collection of regulatory regions including non-coding RNAs, silencers, insulators and <italic toggle="yes">cis/trans</italic>-regulatory elements. Transcriptional enhancers, a class of distal <italic toggle="yes">cis</italic>-regulatory elements, are of particular interest as they are able to direct the cell type-specific transcriptional activity of genes (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Defining enhancers and disentangling their spatio-temporal localization with promoters is important in the context of understanding a wide variety of biological phenomena such as evolution, homeostasis and disease (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). However, current definitions of enhancers are broad and non-specific, while their mode of action is poorly understood. Despite the lower costs and advances in whole-genome sequencing, problems persist in attempts to consolidate the link between enhancers, non-coding genetic variation and protein-coding genes for a great number of diseases. The enhancer characteristics underpinning these difficulties can be broadly summarized by the following points:</p>
    <list list-type="bullet">
      <list-item>
        <p><italic toggle="yes">Enhancers are promiscuous</italic>. A single enhancer can regulate multiple genes (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p><italic toggle="yes">Enhancers can be redundant</italic>. Perturbing one enhancer can have a minimal effect on the expression of a gene that may rely on several enhancers (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref>).</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p><italic toggle="yes">Enhancer interactions are complex and dynamic</italic>. Enhancers can be located up to, and in some cases beyond, 1 Mb away from their cognate gene (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and interact with gene promoters in specific three-dimensional (3D) spatio-temporal patterns (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p><italic toggle="yes">Enhancer sequence composition is highly heterogeneous</italic>. There is no known conserved enhancer sequence that universally defines all enhancers (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p>
      </list-item>
    </list>
    <p>To address these difficulties, current methods to find enhancers have sought to identify them through their associated features. One of the most common features are histone modifications. H3K4me1 is associated with enhancers in the active (when co-existing with H3K27ac), inactive and primed (when co-existing with H3K27me3) states (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Other marks such as H3K4me3 (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), H3K79me2 (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), as well as H3K64ac, H3K122ac and H4K16ac (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), have also been found to be enriched at histones proximal to distinct sets of enhancer sequences. Currently, these marks can be used to identify putative enhancers, but they are correlative and not universally present in all experimentally validated enhancers (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p>
    <p>Beyond histone marks, coactivators such as CREB-binding protein (CBP) and P300 have been proven to be a prerequisite for the activity of some enhancers by their acetyltransferase activity at H3K27 and recruitment of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Other methods that are currently used to identify enhancers include enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) that exhibit bidirectional transcription and are quantified by cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE-seq) protocols. FANTOM has catalogued putative enhancers based on this assay (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In addition to this, self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) has become a popular high-throughput method to experimentally assess the transcriptional-enhancing properties of the DNA sequences in putative enhancers (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17–19</xref>). Finally, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) can be used to associate non-coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in putative enhancer sequences with changes in gene expression (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p>
    <p>Enhancer-associated features can be used individually or in tandem to identify enhancers, albeit with varying levels of success (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). This highlights the difficulty in both ubiquitously identifying enhancers and assessing the performance of computational models to predict them. A way of improving such predictions is to integrate more data to better inform the model.</p>
    <p>The organization of chromatin into higher order hierarchical structures such as A/B compartments, topologically associated domains (TADs) and enhancer–promoter loops has been associated with orchestrating cell type-specific gene regulation by localizing regulatory enhancers to promoters in specific spatio-temporal patterns (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). These patterns of connectivity can be uncovered by methods known as chromosome conformation capture (3C) such as Hi-C, capture-Hi-C, ChIA-PET or HiChIP (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). These specific patterns of 3D chromatin conformation add yet another layer of complexity to the genome and represent a feature from which the spatio-temporal localization of enhancers with promoters can be determined. Indeed, there are some pioneering predictive algorithms that have sought to leverage this information to link enhancers with their target genes in specific cell lines. The activity-by-contact (ABC) model uses Hi-C data, gene expression, accessible chromatin information and active histone marks to predict promoter–enhancer interaction (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Enformer exploits deep learning models trained with massive collections of chromatin and gene expression data to predict gene expression effects of DNA sequence variation at distal regulatory regions using DNA sequence as the sole input (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The main challenge of these methods is the large amount of training data that is required.</p>
    <p>A caveat of using 3C data from bulk cell populations is that it provides a snapshot of the most frequent chromatin interactions and is therefore insensitive to the dynamic and transient nature of many enhancer–promoter interactions. Additionally, single-cell Hi-C approaches are still only capturing a very small proportion of the total interactions (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and do not allow for the comprehensive detection of promoter–enhancer interactions at adequate resolutions. There is also increasing evidence that enhancer–promoter contacts are not a prerequisite for all enhancer activity. For example, transcriptional bursting has been demonstrated to enable the periodic transcription of genes (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), but the temporal dynamics of promoter–enhancer interactions appear to be uncoupled from those of transcription (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Moreover, enhancer activity has also been observed with a distinct lack of enhancer–promoter proximity (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). These types of interactions are susceptible to be missed as, typically, 3C data are interrogated in a pairwise manner. To demonstrate this, consider the scenario where the transcription of a gene in fragment A is driven by the enhancer found in fragment C and these are linked by their distinct interactions with fragment B. In traditional 3C data representations, the indirect interactions between fragment A and C are lost. Although microscopy approaches can address this, they are limited by their low throughput. Therefore, a useful way to capture these lost pairwise interactions is to represent 3C data as networks. In a network, an interaction between loci A and C can be inferred through their common interaction with loci B that would otherwise be lost using established pairwise methods.</p>
    <p>Representing these 3C data as networks has the potential to capture more chromatin interactions as well as to uncover hidden trends beyond direct interactions such as cooperative regulatory subnetworks (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Such advantages of network analysis have already been demonstrated. For example, Sandhu <italic toggle="yes">et a</italic><italic toggle="yes">l</italic>. constructed a chromatin interaction network (CIN) from RNAPII-mediated interactions describing large-scale organization into chromatin communities with specific function (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). We were able to use CINs and assortativity measures to demonstrate how specific features of the chromatin are enriched in promoter–promoter contacts versus promoter–non-promoter contacts (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). For example, H3K4me3 was more enriched in promoter–promoter interactions, while actively elongating variant RNAPII-S2P was more enriched in promoter–active-enhancer contacts (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Thibodeau and colleagues have demonstrated that H3K4me3 broad domains and superenhancers in CINs maintained unique and distinct topological properties, including higher connectivity, that could be used to distinguish broad domains from promoters and superenhancers from normal enhancers (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Finally, recent reports have shown the usefulness of graph-based approaches to detect functional modules in 3C data (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34–37</xref>).</p>

The four coloured fragment nodes correspond to the fragments shown in (A). Esearch3D expands the chromatin network by adding gene-expression nodes (circles) that connect to the fragments containing genes (like the blue fragment). Right: one of the many network paths, showing examples of the three types of nodes.</p>

    </fig>
    <p>It is becoming increasingly apparent that the global organization of chromatin and the accumulation of perturbations across the genome can have subtle but tangible effects on gene expression of most expressed genes. An omni-genic model has been proposed, where the activity of almost any gene would affect that of almost every other gene as a result of the small-world properties of regulatory networks (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). This model was proposed as an attempt to explain the multiloci nature of many complex diseases such as Alzheimer's (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) or Crohn's disease (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) that has been uncovered by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Due to the small-world properties of regulatory networks, most expressed genes in a given cell type would be only a few steps from the nearest core disease gene and thus may have non-zero effects on disease. As these mechanisms probably act to influence the localization of regulatory enhancers to gene promoters, a pan-genomic model based purely on 3D genome interactions has since been proposed to reconcile the strong effects of overexpressing transcription factors in changing cellular phenotypes with the data from eQTL studies (where genetic effects are small but widespread) (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Focusing solely on the 3D genome network and transcription, this work shows how changing the activity of just one gene can dramatically change the topology of the networks and the overall transcriptional programme This demonstrates clearly that we cannot always study the regulation of a particular gene in isolation (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Despite this, none of the current methods to identify the enhancers regulating a particular gene takes into account the expression of the other genes being transcribed.</p>
    <p>In recent years, network propagation has emerged as a powerful method to integrate biological networks and different types of data, such as the investigation of protein–protein interaction networks to identify new associations between genes and disease or genes and drugs [see review by Cowen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>)]. Recent developments of network propagation approaches have shown their usefulness in identifying disease genes from GWAS data (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) and ageing-associated genes (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) or discovering cancer drivers among genes with infrequent cancer mutations (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Fundamentally, network propagation aims to describe the associations and relationships between the nodes in the network. This type of analysis is not limited to the study of biological systems either. Consider the PageRank algorithm which was first employed by Google (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). PageRank works by returning websites (represented as nodes) in order of their importance. Imagine, for website A its importance is a function of the number of websites linking to it—in this example two with B and C—and the importance of B and C determined by the number and importance of the websites linking to them. Using such a process enables all of the websites to be ranked relative to one another. Network propagation has the additional benefit of incorporating <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> information about the nodes, meaning that some nodes are more important than others and, as such, connections to these nodes are considered more favourable by the propagation algorithm, which can help to improve the identification of influential nodes by PageRank (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>).</p>
    <p>Here, we describe Esearch3D, an approach that exploits the global relationship between the 3D genome and transcription to identify active enhancers in 3C data by propagating gene expression levels across chromatin networks. Biologically, signals pertaining to transcriptional activation are transferred across the regulatory network from enhancers found in intergenic loci to genes in the form of transcription factors, cofactors and various types of transcriptional machinery such as RNAPII. Conceptually it can be described as a flow of information between enhancers and genes, mediated by the chromatin communication network. How and where this information is transmitted to and from is central to decoding the regulatory landscape of any gene and, therefore, identifying enhancers. We show that by reverse engineering this flow of information, we can identify intergenic regulatory enhancers using solely gene expression and 3D genomic data.</p>

      <p>Processed 3C datasets were downloaded for mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs, serum) and three immune human cell types. For mESCs, we used the DNase I capture dataset from Joshi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) and promoter-capture Hi-C (PCHi-C) from Schoenfelder <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) and reprocessed by Pancaldi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), both aligned to the GRCm38/mm9 reference genome. For the human primary immune cells, we used data from Javierre <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, aligned to the GRCh37/hg19 reference genome (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Contacts were normalized and loops were called in the three datasets using the CHiCAGO algorithm (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). The normalized contact matrix was then transformed into an unweighted and undirected network G = (V, E) where the chromatin fragments are represented as nodes V and their interactions as edges E.</p>

      <title>Enhancer annotation</title>
      <p>As is common in all enhancer prediction models, the identification of a suitable ‘truth set’ of validated enhancers is non-trivial. Currently gold standard approaches such as CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) perturbation are limited in both the scalability to assess putative enhancer sequences genome wide and the availability of these data for multiple cell types. As there is no genome-wide gold standard for enhancer identification in mESCs, we identified several enhancer-associated features that could be used to label the intergenic nodes as enhancers and non-enhancers.</p>
      <p>We first used genome-wide chromatin profiles to identify putative enhancers in mESCs based on histone marks, including H3K27ac, H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). To efficiently summarize the data, we utilized the popular ChromHMM method (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), and only bins with a posterior probability &gt;0.95 were considered (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). The nodes were then labelled with the chromatin state bins and the percentage overlap of each state was calculated per fragment. This was further supplemented with the annotation of enhancer-associated features from experimental data; these included three RNAPII variants and P300 ChIPseq (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>), STARR-seq (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>) and bidirectional CAGE-seq sites from the FANTOM project (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). By combining these data, we were then able both to distinguish intergenic nodes as enhancers and to stratify this set into high and low confidence groups based on the number of features present. For the immune cells, we defined putative enhancers using chromatin states (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) from BLUEPRINT (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), eQTL SNPs (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and bidirectional CAGE-seq sites from the FANTOM project (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>).</p>

      <title>Development of a network-based expression propagation strategy</title>
      <p>Our network-based propagation algorithm, implemented within Esearch3D, uses the propagation function <italic toggle="yes">f</italic>- defined by Zhou <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). This algorithm is best understood as simulating a process where node A in the network contains an <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> value (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). In the first iteration, the propagation algorithm spreads or ‘propagates’ this value to the adjacent neighbours of A, which are B, C and D. In the second iteration B, C and D can propagate their values from the first iteration to their adjacent neighbours E and F. This process continues for a set number of iterations based on the user input. These processes have a wide range of applications, but fundamentally they are all able to impute information in nodes with no <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> value based on the starting value at A.</p>
      <p>Another feature of this algorithm is that the propagation processes factors in the global topology of the network. The number of connections between the nodes and their patterns will ultimately influence the final imputed value of each node. This can be useful when we want to assess the importance of the topological characteristics of nodes in the CIN in relation to gene expression. In our case, we wanted to understand if enhancers were uniquely connected within the network to transmit regulatory information to genes. To test this, we calculated an imputed activity score (IAS) in intergenic nodes based on the topology of a CIN using gene expression as our <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> starting values in gene nodes.</p>

      <title>Network-based propagation algorithm</title>
      <p>We define a connected weighted graph G(V, E) with a set of nodes V = {v1, v2, …, vN} and a set of links E = {(vi, vj)|vi, vj∈V}, a set of source/seed nodes S⊆V and an N × N adjacency matrix W of link weights equal to 1 (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Here, we use a Random Walk with Restart (RWR) algorithm for measuring the relative importance of node vi to S. RWR mimics a walker that moves from a current node to a randomly selected adjacent node or goes back to source nodes with a back-probability γ∈(0, 1). RWR can be formally described as follows:</p>
      <disp-formula>

      </disp-formula>
      <p>where Pt is an N × 1 probability vector of |V| nodes at a time step t of which the ith element represents the probability of the walker being at node vi∈V, P0 is the N × 1 initial probability vector and W' is the transition matrix of the graph; the (i,j) element in W' denotes a probability with which a walker at vi moves to vj among V{vi}.</p>
      <p>To provide some intuition as to how this method works, consider the following example. At a genic node, a walker starts with some amount of information; in this case, the value given by the gene expression. The walker then has an equal probability to transition to any of its direct neighbours and carry a proportion of the gene expression value to that node. The amount of gene expression that can transition is determined by the insulating parameter γ. For example, where γ = 0.8, only 20% of the original gene expression value can transition. Low values of γ were chosen as genes are unlikely to be highly regulated by nodes very far away. The other parameter corresponds to the number of iterations and influences how many times this process takes place. A low number of iterations limits the amount of gene expression that can be carried to neighbouring nodes which can lead to these nodes obtaining similar values, making it more difficult to distinguish their relative importance to the gene node of interest.</p>

      <title>Esearch3D R package</title>
      <p>Esearch3D is implemented in R, freely available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/InfOmics/Esearch3D" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/InfOmics/Esearch3D</ext-link> and <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7737123" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7737123</ext-link>. It takes as input a CIN and a cell type-specific gene expression profile. The network must be divided into two components, one composed of genes and the 3C fragments they map to where the overlap is represented as an interaction. The second component includes the interactions (contacts) from the 3C data. The network can be inputted as an adjacent matrix, edge list or igraph object (<ext-link xlink:href="https://igraph.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://igraph.org</ext-link>). The gene expression profile must be in the standard matrix format N × 1 such that rows are genes and columns are the replicates, conditions. Esearch3D propagates the gene expression values into genic- and intergenic-fragments of the network in parallel using the R package doParallel (version 1.0.17). The functions ‘create_net2plot’ and ‘start_GUI’ represent results as an R igraph object and visualize it in a shiny (version 1.7.2) graphical user interface (GUI).</p>
      <p>Esearch3D enables researchers to investigate genes or fragments by providing the names of the genes to analyse and running a new propagation with the function called ‘rwr_SGprop’ (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). This step provides how much each gene of interest contributed to give information to the chromatin network nodes (genomic fragments) and also how much information each fragment received from the genes of interest. Esearch3D documentation includes a vignette detailing the workflow to classify any node as an enhancer or not, where information about the number of enhancer annotations associated with the fragments of the CIN are made available. This workflow enables the user to build a machine learning algorithm to classify nodes within the network as enhancers. Esearch3D computes the centrality measures of the nodes with the function ‘get_centr_info’, runs the multigene propagation and combines all the information in a matrix format. The subsequent matrix contains, for each node in the network, the IAS, the provided centrality measures as well as the number of enhancer annotations (provided by the user). The user can then build the classifier with the function ‘enhancer_classifier’. The function ‘train’ tunes and tests a Random Forest classifier with the R package mlr3. The best classifier can then be passed to the function ‘explain_classifier’ that builds an explainer with the R package DALEX. The explainer describes what the classifier learnt, how much each feature contributes to the prediction and which decisions are used to predict an unlabelled node. Topological features are calculated with the igraph R package and the Random Forest models are built with the DALEX R package (version 2.4.1)—see vignettes at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/InfOmics/Esearch3D" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/InfOmics/Esearch3D</ext-link> for details.</p>

      <p>Precision–recall curves plot, at increasing thresholds, the precision, which is the fraction of nodes correctly predicted as enhancers (i.e. positive for the five enhancer features in Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>), and the recall, which is the fraction of the total number of enhancers predicted. Often, a trade-off occurs between these two metrics whereby increased recall reduces the precision, and vice versa. When plotted on the same graph, the area under the curve produced by this plot indicates the general classification performance of the model. The precision and recall of enhancer nodes using centrality measures and the corresponding area under the curve (AUPRC) were calculated using the precrec library (version 0.12.7) (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). The baseline values were calculated as the total number of enhancer nodes as a proportion of the total number of nodes in the CIN.</p>

      <title>Comparison of Esearch3d with the ABC model</title>

We used the DNaseI-seq and H3K27ac ChIPseq data from Joshi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), and the Hi-C data from Bonev <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). DNaseI-seq and H3K27ac data required a few pre-processing steps to extract the input required for ABC. Reads were aligned to the reference mm9 genome file using bwa-mem (version 0.7.17). Picard (version 2.27.5) was used for sorting the aligned reads by coordinate and removing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) duplicates through the MarkDuplicates function. Bedtools (version 2.30.0) was used to retain only uniquely mapping reads using the -bq 30 parameter on samtools view. We ran the ABC model following the guidelines on the tool GitHub page from step one to three, changing the reference to mouse. In the makeCandidateRegions –nStrongestPeaks parameter, we used 150 000 as suggested by the authors. In the prediction step, we did not define a threshold (–threshold 0) to retrieve all the candidate regions with their respective scores. Precision–recall curves on ABC scores were computed in the same way as described in the previous section but using only three of the enhancer features, i.e. those that were not included as input of the model, namely enhancer features P300 ChIPseq (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), STARR-seq (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) and CAGE-seq (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). The same curves were computed on the Esearch3D IAS score and on the Esearch3D IAS score corrected with H3K27ac information. This correction was defined as follows: if the fragment node had &lt;40% of its bases overlapping an acetylated region, then its IAS was set to 0.</p>

      <title>Overview and conceptual description of Esearch3D</title>
      <p>We have developed an R package called Esearch3D. The tool utilizes a bespoke semi-supervised network propagation algorithm to predict active enhancers using solely gene expression and chromatin interaction data. Enhancers are non-randomly located and connected in the network such that they have the potential to regulate cell type-specific gene expression. Esearch3D exploits this phenomenon to identify intergenic regions with regulatory functions.</p>
      <p>Esearch3D models 3C data as CINs. Each genomic fragment from the 3C data is represented as a node and each fragment to fragment interaction as an edge (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The fragment nodes are categorized into two types: gene-fragment nodes where the fragment coordinates overlap with a gene annotation and intergenic-fragment nodes where they do not. Additionally, Esearch3D includes a third node type: gene-expression nodes. Each gene-expression node is connected to the corresponding gene-fragment nodes by an edge where the gene-fragment node harbours a gene promoter. Given that genes can overlap with multiple fragments and multiple genes can overlap with the same fragment, integrating gene expression with fragment nodes is not a trivial step. Representing gene promoters as additional distinct nodes in the CIN enables Esearch3D to easily integrate gene expression profiles with minimal bias.</p>
      <p>Network-based propagation is a method used to predict the activity of nodes based on the activity of other nodes in the network. The basic idea is to use the known activity of each gene-fragment node and propagate this information throughout the network to all other nodes where proximal and tightly clustered nodes will receive a higher score than those further away in the network. Using this approach, Esearch3D maps the gene expression values to the corresponding gene-expression nodes and propagates them to their corresponding gene-fragment nodes in the first step, and to all other nodes, including intergenic-fragment nodes, in the second step (see example with a toy network in Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The resulting intergenic nodes receive an activity score (IAS, see Material and Methods) which accounts for the distance of the nodes, the topology of the network and the <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> expression values of all genes within the network (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). For example, an intergenic-fragment node receives a high IAS, and is therefore more likely to be an enhancer if it is adequately connected and in close proximity to highly expressed gene-expression nodes. Much like gene expression reflects the transcriptional activity of a gene, the IAS reflects the enhancer activity of non-coding regions. The IAS score is based on the propagation of all expressed genes throughout the whole network. It is therefore a function of the distance of the intergenic-fragment nodes (i.e. the number of steps) to all other gene-fragment nodes in the network, the topology of the network and the expression levels of all genes within the network. In addition to predicting enhancers, our method highlights the integral role of global chromatin organization in mediating gene expression.</p>

      <title>Imputed activity scores at intergenic nodes are higher in active enhancer nodes</title>
      <p>Esearch3D infers the likelihood of enhancer activity at an intergenic locus with the IAS following the propagation of gene expression. Esearch3D requires two inputs: 3C data which are modelled as a network, and gene expression data. We generated our first set of results using the high-resolution DNase I Capture Hi-C (DHS-CHi-C) generated by Joshi and co-workers (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) in mESCs. This dataset was chosen owing to a diverse set of publicly available canonical enhancer-associated features in mESCs, which can be used to validate our predictions (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). DHS-CHi-C targets regions of the mouse genome that are hypersensitive to DNase I (DHS regions), enriching for chromatin-accessible regions. From this DHS-CHi-C data, we created a CIN, where each genomic fragment from this dataset is represented as a node and each fragment–fragment interaction as an edge (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The DHS-CHi-C network consists of a total of 162 615 fragment nodes connected by 787 879 edges with an average degree of 9.69. The CIN is split across 776 connected components. The majority of the nodes (97.7%) are members of the major connected component. We then identified gene-fragment nodes by mapping Ensembl-defined genes to the nodes (see the Materials and Methods and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables S3–S5</xref>). We found that 36% of the nodes in the CIN were labelled as intergenic; that is to say that there are no overlaps of the gene body [including untranslated regions (UTRs), exons and introns]. Although introns also have many enhancers [see (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>), for example], we focused here in the prediction of enhancers not overlapping with genes.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>To validate the efficacy of the IAS as a predictive feature of intergenic enhancers, intergenic-fragment nodes were then labelled using the following enhancer-associated features: chromatin states derived from histone mark ChIP-seq experiments, P300, RNAPII s2p elongating variant (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>), STARR-seq (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>) and CAGE-seq data from the FANTOM project (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>) (see the Materials and Methods and Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). In the mESC DHS-CHi-C, network we found that in nodes that contain at least one enhancer-associated feature there was a significant difference in the median value of the IAS in enhancer intergenic-fragment nodes compared with non-enhancer intergenic-fragment nodes (Wilcoxon test <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value &lt;2.2e-16). Intergenic-fragment nodes were then stratified into six groups based on the different combinations of the five enhancer labels as well as the absence of any labels. We found that the median value of the IAS in each group increased as the number of enhancer labels increased, while the median IAS from nodes devoid of any enhancer annotations to the group labelled with all five annotations increased by a factor of 46 (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). These results show that the value of the IAS is higher in intergenic-fragment enhancer nodes compared with non-enhancer nodes. Furthermore, the IAS is found to be higher in nodes that contain an increasing number of enhancer features (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>).</p>
      <p>We then applied Esearch3D to an alternative 3D genome capture data type by extending the analysis to PCHi-C-derived interactions for mESCs. The resulting network showed that PCHi-C results in a higher number of connected components resulting in a more disconnected network than the DHS-CHi-C network (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables S3 and S4</xref>). Despite this, results are consistent with our previous observations using the DHS-CHi-C network with a higher IAS in enhancer nodes and significant increases in the median value of IAS between each group (Wilcoxon rank sum test <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value &lt;2.2e-16, Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). The IAS shows a minimum 14-fold enrichment overall in the high confidence enhancer nodes compared with the non-enhancer nodes for the mESC PCHi-C network.</p>
      <p>These results show that Esearch3D can be used to approximate enhancer activity in chromatin fragments derived from DHS-CHi-C and PCHi-C experiments. This is achieved independently from any <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> knowledge of enhancer-associated features, using only gene expression and 3C contact data and without the need for model parameterization. These results show that Esearch3D can be used to leverage the intrinsic relationship between the chromatin topology and gene expression to identify which nodes harbour enhancers.</p>

      <title>Imputed activity scores can be used to classify enhancer nodes</title>
      <p>Following the observations of IAS enrichment in enhancer nodes, we then used the IAS to classify nodes as enhancers and non-enhancers. Using the canonical enhancer-associated features (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>) as our ground truth, we plotted the precision–recall curves for the DHS-CHi-C network and determined the area under the precision–recall curve (AUPRC, Materials and Methods). The IAS is able to correctly classify an enhancer node containing at least one of the five enhancer-associated features with an AUPRC of 0.650 over a baseline of 0.469 (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). The baseline is calculated as the ratio of enhancer nodes (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 27 539) divided by the total number of intergenic nodes (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 58 672). This is equal to a performance of 0.181 over baseline. For the mESC PCHi-C network there is a 0.095 increase over the baseline (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>), a 0.086 decrease when compared with the mESC DHS-CHi-C network. The differences observed between the two capture methods are likely to be due to the smaller representation of the mESC genome by PCHi-C compared with a DHS-CHi-C that covers 50% more of the total genome. This has two main effects. One is the number of potential enhancers that are captured; the proportion of intergenic nodes in the DHS-CHi-C network labelled as enhancers is 50% compared with 43% for the PCHi-C network. The second is that a lower coverage capture of the genome by the PCHi-C results in the capture of fewer enhancers across the genome. In the PCHi-C network, we observe a lower average degree of 2.61 compared with 9.69 for the DNase I network (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). We note that this does not drastically alter the density of the network which calculates the ratio between the number of actual connections versus the number of potential connections; the number of potential connections is given by the binomial coefficient of the number of nodes. This suggests that the PCHi-C is not losing information about the topology of the network, rather it is sampling a smaller proportion of the real CIN.</p>

      <title>Chromatin topology and gene expression are crucial features to identify enhancers</title>
      <p>The ability of Esearch3D to predict enhancer nodes is based on the propagation of gene expression across the CIN. This propagated gene expression data from the genic nodes to the intergenic nodes. Our results suggest that enhancer nodes maintain distinct connectivity patterns with gene nodes compared with non-enhancer nodes such that they receive a higher IAS. Therefore, the quality of the predictions relies on both the gene expression data and the network topology.</p>
      <p>To demonstrate this, we tested how the performance of the IAS as a predictive feature changes when the topology of the network is perturbed. To do so, we applied a degree-preserving rewiring algorithm to shuffle the edges of the mESC DNase I network to create an ensemble of 100 rewired networks. This maintains the number of connections a node has while shuffling the node to which it is connected. We then ran Esearch3D on the ensemble of randomized networks to predict enhancer nodes. We then aggregated and compared the predictions with those of the original network. Results showed that following the randomization the ability of the model to classify enhancer nodes was lost with an AUPRC = 0.49 over a baseline of 0.47 (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). This indicates that the spatial proximity of intergenic nodes with genic nodes is important for driving these predictions, in line with evidence suggesting the role of transcriptional factories is a key determinant of gene expression (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>).</p>
      <p>There is increasing evidence that gene expression is regulated at a global level as outlined by the pan-genomic and omnigenic models (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). These models suggest that aggregate and subtle changes in the expression of genes can influence the expression of others and, by extension, enhancers can have subtle cascading effects on transcription throughout the genome. For Esearch3D we modelled this process by propagating the expression of all genes across the network and calculating the IAS at each intergenic node, which reflects its regulatory contribution and therefore its likelihood of containing an enhancer. To provide a counterfactual example, we propagated the expression of a single gene of interest in order to predict the enhancers that directly regulate its expression. This approach is also available in the Esearch3D software. In this scenario, the expression profile of a single gene of interest was propagated across the CIN. We carried out this test on the top 100 most highly expressed genes (112 when including ties). Results showed that the propagation of 112 single genes across the network reduced the performance of the model compared with that of a random classifier AUPRC = 0.19 (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the global properties of the chromatin network and the global effects of gene expression are important features to identify enhancers.</p>
      <p>In addition we also investigated how Esearch3D compares with the ABC model (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). ABC scores enhancer–gene interactions based on enhancer activity, chromatin accessibility, gene expression and, optionally, 3D interactions. Both ABC and Esearch3D use gene expression and 3D genome data to predict enhancers. However, ABC requires additional input information in the form of ChIPseq data for H3K37ac, ATACseq or DNaseI-seq and, optionally, full-genome Hi-C data. In order to compare the two tools, we took into account their dissimilarities in terms of required input data. We compared the precision and recall of the ABC scores and Esearch3D’s IAS in mESCs, using three enhancer features for validation that neither of the two methods use as input, namely P300 ChIPseq (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), STARR-seq (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) and CAGE-seq (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>).</p>
      <p>We show how Esearch3D and ABC have very comparable results in terms of AUPRC, with 0.412 for ABC and 0.397 for Esearch3D. Importantly, ABC uses two data types that Esearch3D does not, DNaseI-seq and H3K27ac, to pre-define the regions of highest potential of being active enhancers. This means that using a restricted number of input resources, Esearch3D is still able to perform comparatively. Running the ABC model is less convenient in terms of required input data, and at the same time more cumbersome, as it requires further data pre-processing. These results suggest that using further input data in Esearch3D can improve its performance. Indeed, when we pre-select nodes which present acetylated regions in Esearch3D, we also obtain better precision–recall curves than ABC, with an AUPRC of 0.445 (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>).</p>

      <title>Esearch3D can be used to study the regulatory function of regions with eQTL SNPs</title>
      <p>One of the main lessons gained from GWAS is that most disease-associated SNPs lie within non-coding regions that are enriched in enhancers (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). eQTL studies have shown how genetic variation across the genome can result in significant and quantifiable changes in gene expression (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). eQTL SNPs are defined by classifying individuals by that SNP genotype and calculating correlations with gene expression levels of genes in proximity to their linear genome (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). These approaches help to identify the cell types where disease-associated SNPs show an effect and to statistically associate non-coding SNPs with the potential gene targets, thereby aiding in the functional interpretation of GWAS hits outside genes (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p>

      <p>The BLUEPRINT Consortium generated eQTL data for three human immune cell types: monocytes, neutrophils and CD4+ T cells (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). We used these data to test the ability of Esearch3D to prioritize the regulatory potential of non-genic regions harbouring eQTL SNPs. For these cell types, we used available PCHi-C data (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) to generate 3D genome networks and annotated the non-genic nodes with the cell type-specific eQTL SNPs, enhancer chromatin states from BLUEPRINT (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>) and bidirectional CAGE-seq sites from the FANTOM project (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). We found 46 078 monocyte nodes, 39 930 neutrophil nodes and 48 016 T-cell nodes with eQTL SNPs, but only 41% of eQTLs in monocytes overlapped with nodes containing either FANTOM or BLUEPRINT enhancers, with 28% in neutrophils and 31% in T-cells.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, we observed a significantly higher IAS in non-genic nodes with eQTLs compared with non-genic nodes without eQTLs in all three cell types (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value &lt;2.2e-16), even in nodes that did not overlap with experimentally defined enhancer features (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>–<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). These eQTLs may point to loci that contain weaker enhancers that are not annotated by either CAGE-seq or chromatin state data. However, Esearch3D also predicts higher activity (IAS) when the non-genic nodes with eQTL SNPs also overlap with enhancer features (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value &lt;2.2e-16) (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>–<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). These results suggest that the IAS calculated by Esearch3D can help to prioritize eQTL SNPs with higher potential of being regulatory regions.</p>
      <p>In line with previous results in mESC-derived networks, we also find that the IAS is generally higher in nodes with all three annotations. This further highlights the generalizability of our model to additional cell types, including primary cell types that are difficult to assay for enhancer annotations that depend on transfections, such as CRISPR deletion/silencing experiments or STARR-seq screens.</p>

    <sec id="SEC3-6">
      <title>The IAS can be used in conjunction with centrality measures to classify enhancer nodes</title>
      <p>Employing five commonly used network measures (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>), we calculated different topological characteristics of intergenic nodes in the mESC DHS-CHi-C network (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). We calculated the degree, which reflects the number of edges, or connections, that the nodes in the network maintain; the betweenness centrality, which measures the number of shortest paths that pass through a node—this measurement reflects how important a node is in connecting other nodes; the closeness centrality that reflects how central a node is in the network relative to all other nodes; the clustering coefficient, a measure of the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together; and finally the eigenvector centrality, which measures the influence of a node within the network—this is calculated relative to the scores of other nodes in the network where a node with a high eigenvalue score connects to many other nodes with high eigenvalue scores.</p>
      <p>A Random Forest classifier was then used to combine these scores along with the IAS in order to classify intergenic enhancer nodes from the mESC DHS-CHi-C network. We utilized the out-of-bag (OOB) error as a measurement to evaluate the contribution of each of the five topological metrics along with the IAS when classifying intergenic enhancer and intergenic non-enhancer nodes. OOB measures the loss of classification performance of the Random Forest classifier when the feature of interest is removed. For capture Hi-C there is a bias between baits (such as promoters or, in this case, DHS sites) and other ends (non-bait fragments) due to the enrichment protocol (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). This results in artificially lower connectivity for other end nodes when compared with baits (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Due to the unique nature of capture Hi-C networks, we evaluated the five topological metrics and the IAS for non-genic baits and other ends separately, using two different Random Forest models.</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="gkad229fig5" position="float"/>
      </fig>
      <p>We found that for non-genic baits, the degree centrality was the feature that was the most informative when classifying nodes into intergenic enhancers and intergenic non-enhancers, with a drop out loss of 0.33 (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). The IAS was the next best measure, with a drop out loss of 0.20. For other ends, the best performing feature was the IAS, with a drop out loss of 0.37 (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). Interestingly, the degree centrality was only the fourth most important feature for the other ends where connectivity information is lost due to the capture Hi-C design. In summary, the IAS performs well for both types of fragments and contributes to enhancer prediction, highlighting the advantage of integrating gene expression data compared with only measuring the topological characteristics of intergenic nodes. This approach is particularly powerful to predict enhancers in less connected other end nodes, suggesting that the Esearch3D approach is a useful tool to compensate for the interaction sampling bias in capture Hi-C experiments.</p>

      <title>Esearch3D is implemented as an R package with a shiny-based GUI to explore the results</title>
      <p>We have shown how the IAS can be used to predict the location of enhancers. We have implemented Esearch3D as an R package. The method can be applied following the provided workflow with the CIN and the gene expression profiles of the user's cell type of interest (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). The software begins by performing the function ‘rwr_OVprop’ twice. During the first step, the expression of the genes is propagated from their corresponding nodes into the genic nodes. In the second step, the gene expression is then propagated across the rest of the network. This imputes a proxy for transcriptional activity, the IAS, at intergenic nodes.</p>
      <p>The user can visualize the propagation results in a matrix format or with the GUI developed with R shiny (Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The GUI allows one to explore a gene expression profile after a network-based propagation, to investigate the IASs obtained by specific genes and their neighbourhoods and to import the propagated chromatin network into Cytoscape (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). The GUI allows users to visualize and focus on specific modules of the CIN based on their interests. To illustrate the GUI functionality, we loaded the propagation results of the mESC DHS-CHi-C network and explored the interactors of the gene node of the proto-oncogene <italic toggle="yes">Myc</italic> (Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The interaction (in orange) between the <italic toggle="yes">Myc</italic> node and node frag54325 indicates that the <italic toggle="yes">Myc</italic> locus is located inside this genomic fragment in mouse chromosome 15; the purple edges show the direct fragment–fragment interactions of the fragment containing <italic toggle="yes">Myc</italic>. The interacting fragment with the highest IAS value is frag54325 (chr15:61807659–61821282): this corresponds to a genomic region downstream of <italic toggle="yes">Myc</italic> that overlaps with all enhancer features (STARR-seq, FANTOM bidirectional CAGE-seq, P300, enhancer chromatin states and RNAPII s2p). Interestingly, this genomic region overlaps with the GSDMC gene cluster that is downstream of the recently discovered ′blood enhancer cluster’, conserved between human and mouse, that controls <italic toggle="yes">Myc</italic> in mouse haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). The region containing the GSDMC gene cluster has been shown to form part of the regulatory network of <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic> in human cell lines (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>), suggesting that this could be an important regulatory node in mESCs too.</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>The folding of chromatin into hierarchical structures ultimately acts to localize genes with the prerequisite machinery for transcription such as RNAPII (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>) and the appropriate chromatin modifications (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). Whether gene expression dictates the chromatin architecture or vice versa is poorly understood. In either case, it is clear that the organization of chromatin plays an important role in mediating the communication between genes and enhancers. Herein, we have outlined a method that can be used to predict enhancers by leveraging the relationship between gene expression and the global chromatin architecture. To achieve this, we model interaction data from Hi-C-derived methods as networks.</p>
    <p>We use a network propagation algorithm based on random walks to integrate gene expression data within the CIN. The use of network propagation has been proposed previously in other fields, such as heat diffusion processes, energy states within electrical circuits, and graph kernels in machine learning (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Other applications in biology include gene function prediction, module discovery and drug target prediction; see Cowen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In cancer research, for example, network propagation has been used to identify previously unknown proteins involved in the progression of cancers by propagating mutational frequencies across a protein–protein interaction network (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). We use the same concept with chromatin–chromatin interaction networks and propagating gene expression values instead of mutational frequencies. By doing so, Esearch3D is able to impute an activity score (IAS) in intergenic nodes by propagating the gene expression values from genic nodes across the CIN. The IAS is a metric that summarizes the importance of an intergenic node in the context of its proximity to all of the genic nodes within the network, the relative expression of those genes as well as the topology of the entire network. Most widely used methods to identify enhancers do not incorporate gene expression, nor do they evaluate the subtle, but important, influences exerted by chromatin's global organization. Esearch3D builds on this, modelling 3D genome data as networks, and then exploits graph-theory algorithms to integrate RNA-seq data in order to calculate an IAS.</p>
    <p>The underlying assumption of Esearch3D is that the activity, defined by the gene expression, of one chromatin fragment is influenced by, or can influence, the activity of all other chromatin fragments. Transcriptional factories occur through dynamic processes that lead to phase separation (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). These are, in part, influenced by relative levels of gene expression across the CIN, suggesting global influence at a local level (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). We too identify such behaviour in our model. We propagate the expression of all of the genes simultaneously in order to model the global interdependent relationships between genes, chromatin conformation and enhancers. Indeed, we find that the performance of Esearch3D is driven by propagating the expression of all genes, whereas a poor performance is seen when propagating the expression of a single gene. This would suggest that gene expression and chromatin organization are linked at a global level.</p>
    <p>The challenges that exist in finding enhancers stem from a fundamental gap in our knowledge about their composition and mode of action. It is becoming increasingly apparent that chromatin architecture plays an important role in gene regulation by localizing enhancers to gene promoters in specific patterns. This idea is commensurate with the looping mechanisms that localize enhancers and gene promoters resulting in an increased contact frequency (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). These effects can be obvious as shown by the loss of interaction between the ZRS enhancer and the <italic toggle="yes">SHH</italic> promoter following the deletion of a key CTCF site (<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). This suggests that enhancers and genes are distinctly connected within the 3D chromatin structure compared with other loci. However, to what extent 3D interactions are always essential for gene regulation is debatable. Some studies have shown that the disruption of some TADs does not lead to wide-scale changes to gene expression (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>), suggesting that mechanisms other than the chromatin topology may regulate gene expression. Alternatively, complex networks are known to be robust to attack (<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>) and, as such, deletion of interactions within the network should not always be expected to result in large gene expression changes. Other explanations such as redundancy in the enhancer networks are equally plausible (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In such cases, more care should be taken when making claims about the role of chromatin organization in gene regulation when regions are studied in isolation. In fact, we show that by studying the relationships between gene expression and the global structure of chromatin, we can accurately identify enhancer regions. We have shown that enhancers and genes within our networks tend to contain distinct topological features, as shown by the centrality scores when compared with non-enhancer and intergenic nodes, and that these features can be used to predict intergenic enhancer nodes. Our data would therefore suggest that chromatin organization plays an important role in coordinating gene regulation.</p>
