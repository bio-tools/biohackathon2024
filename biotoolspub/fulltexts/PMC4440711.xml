      <p>CleavPredict (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cleavpredict.sanfordburnham.org">http://cleavpredict.sanfordburnham.org</ext-link>) is a Web server for substrate cleavage prediction for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). It is intended as a computational platform aiding the scientific community in reasoning about proteolytic events. CleavPredict offers <italic>in silico</italic> prediction of cleavage sites specific for 11 human MMPs. The prediction method employs the MMP specific position weight matrices (PWMs) derived from statistical analysis of high-throughput phage display experimental results. To augment the substrate cleavage prediction process, CleavPredict provides information about the structural features of potential cleavage sites that influence proteolysis. These include: secondary structure, disordered regions, transmembrane domains, and solvent accessibility. The server also provides information about subcellular location, co-localization, and co-expression of proteinase and potential substrates, along with experimentally determined positions of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and posttranslational modification (PTM) sites in substrates. All this information will provide the user with perspectives in reasoning about proteolytic events. CleavPredict is freely accessible, and there is no login required.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Proteolysis is an important posttranslational modification that involves irreversible hydrolysis of peptide bonds by proteinases. Proteolytic processing has a regulatory role in almost all biological pathways, including cell proliferation, cell death, and blood coagulation [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Proteinases identify their substrates with a high degree of specificity. Accurate identification of candidate substrates for proteinases has important implication for understanding the roles of these enzymes in physiological and pathological processes as well as for designing pharmacological intervention approaches. Identification of proteolytic substrates depends on a number of factors. One important factor is the primary substrate specificity, which is defined by a specific amino acid sequence in a substrate that is recognized by the active site of a given proteinase. The efficiency of a cleavage event is also related to the structural properties of the cleavage site. The cleavage site needs to be accessible at the protein surface. Recently, it has been shown that this property as measured by an absolute solvent accessibility index is essential for a proteolytic event to occur [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, cleavage sites that are hidden in native proteins can become accessible as a result of unfolding, allosteric effects, and other proteolytic activity. The efficiency of a cleavage event is also related to the secondary structure of a cleaved amino acid sequence. However, recent statistical analysis of CutDB, the proteolytic event database [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], demonstrated that proteolytic events were uniformly distributed among three types of secondary structures, although with some enrichment in loops. Cleavages in α-helices were found to be relatively abundant in regions apparently prone to unfolding, while cleavages in β-structures tended to be located at the periphery of β-sheets [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Other obvious prerequisites for cleavage to occur are co-localization and co-expression. A proteolytic event is not possible if both substrate and proteinase are not in the same compartment of the cell and if they enter the same cell compartment at different times.</p>
    <p>The majority of human proteinases have multiple (hundreds of) protein targets. For more than 550 known human proteinases, the potential range of normal and pathological proteolytic events is vast. Proteinases participate in a multitude of biological functions including cell cycle progression [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], cell differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], cell migration [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], tissue remodelling [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], cholesterol metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], blood coagulation [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Given such widespread importance, it is not surprising that proteinases represent a significant fraction of all druggable targets [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and that they are driving factors in diseases like emphysema [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], thrombosis [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], arthritis [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], Alzheimer’s [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] metastatic cancer [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], as well as those mediated by viral and bacterial pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
    <p>Among all proteinases, extracellular proteinases matrix metalloproteinases, play a key role in degrading extracellular proteins that help the cell to communicate with its surroundings and function normally. They are important from the physiological, pathological, and pharmaceutical points of view [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127877.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127877.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Vertebrate MMPs have distinct but often overlapping substrate specificities. They can cleave essential extracellular matrix proteins, and, as such, they are highly regulated. The 23 human MMPs can be segregated into three groups; secreted proteinases, proteinases with a transmembrane domain, and proteinases anchored to the membrane with a GPI-linkage. Thus, every MMP is poised to modify interactions between cells, and between cells and the extracellular matrix. So, it is not surprising that MMPs are involved in tumor biology, synaptic plasticity, pulmonary disease, arthritis, atherosclerosis, and sepsis, along with many others [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127877.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In pathological conditions MMPs can play a destructive role, e.g. in rheumatoid and osteoarthritis [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] by degrading key constituents of the extracellular matrix [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>
    <p>However, even in cases where considerable effort has been devoted to the study of an MMP, our understanding of the fundamental principles that determine their substrates and biological roles remains unclear. For example, MMPs are critical for angiogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Experimentally induced corneal angiogenesis is lacking in MMP-14 deficient mice [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and is significantly diminished in the MMP-2 knockouts [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In a mouse model of retinal regeneration after injury, neovascularization is diminished in both MMP-2 and MMP-9 deficient mice, while it is almost absent in the double MMP-2/MMP-9 knockouts [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Inhibition of MMPs using synthetic and endogenous inhibitors has also been shown to down regulate tumor angiogenesis, which is indispensable for tumor development [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. But what are the substrates for these proteinases in angiogenesis? Is a single substrate responsible for the effects of each MMP, or do they cleave distinct substrates?</p>
    <p>Similarly, MMPs have a role at every stage of progression of atherosclerosis [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127877.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. MMPs promote matrix invasion by macrophages [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and angiogenesis into vulnerable plaques [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. These actions contribute to plaque formation and destabilization. On the other hand, MMP-2, 9, and 14 contribute to vascular smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation, thus stabilizing the plaques by increasing its thickness [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p>
    <p>Recently, it was determined that MMPs (e.g. MMP 2, 3, 9, 14, 26) could be shuttled between cellular compartments. These “moonlighting” enzymes can target not only extracellular but also wide range of intracellular proteins [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127877.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p>
    <p>Understanding how MMP enzymes work and what their proteolytic networks are is of great importance to biologists. However, identification of their individual substrates is a more challenging task because of overlapping specificities of MMPs. Experimental discovery of proteinase targets is time- and resource- consuming. To facilitate this process, we have implemented an <italic>in silico</italic> method for predicting substrates for 11 out of the total 25 human MMPs. This method is available on-line via the publicly accessible CleavPredict Web server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cleavpredict.sanfordburnham.org">http://cleavpredict.sanfordburnham.org</ext-link>). On this server, we used the enzyme-specific PWMs as a primary way to predict positions of scissile bonds in protein substrates. The PWMs have been derived based on the cleavage preferences determined from a high-throughput phage display experiment [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127877.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. An efficient and reliable tool for substrate prediction should take into account a number of factors that, if only considered together, define proper conditions for matching substrates with proteinases. We expect that screening the prediction hits using multiple lines of independent qualifiers for proteolytic events is less likely to return a false positive. To augment the predictive ability of the PWMs to recognize positions of scissile bonds, the server provides additional information and evidences (“yes” or “no” filters) for accepting the potential substrate candidate. These include secondary structural elements [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127877.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], solvent exposure, presence of signal peptide, and co-expression and co-localization of the proteinase and the potential substrate. Likelihood of the proteolytic event is low if a proteinase and a substrate enter the same subcellular compartment at different times of the cell life cycle. The data on proteinase temporal behaviour can be assessed using the data of gene co-expression. If both proteinase and its substrate are localized in the same subcellular compartment, the substrate can be classified as a potential strong candidate for further experimental verification. In addition, the server reports the presence of SNPs, with available disease annotation, and PTMs in the substrate that could interfere with the proteolysis process. The analysis of SNPs is helpful in determining whether a new cleavage site was created in the disease protein or the existing (in norm) cleavage site was removed by mutation. Similarly, the presence of PTMs may fundamentally alter the function of the protein including availability of the cleavage site to proteolysis. The CleavPredict server also offers a comparison of our predictions with information contained in CutDB database [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], provides virtual mass spectrum based on predicted cleavage pattern, and finally displays predicted cleavage positions, together with SNPs and PTMs sites on the substrate’s structure, if it is only available in the PDB [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p>
    <p>In summary, the CleavPredict is a useful platform for reasoning about proteolytic events. It can be used as a discovery tool for formulating hypotheses that could be subsequently tested experimentally and conversely, it can be used for interpreting experimental findings, as has been already done in several projects [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Currently, CleavPredict is devoted to recognition of cleavage sites for MMPs, but it will be extended to other proteinases in the future. To our knowledge, none of the existing prediction methods incorporates all factors described here into the process of proteolytic substrate prediction for MMPs. The PROSPER webserver is another available prediction tool, which was developed by Pike <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. It offers the recognition of cleavage sites only for four MMPs (e.g. MMP-2, -9, -3, -7) and the batch mode functionality is not available.</p>

      <title>Derivation of PWMs for predicting cleavage sites</title>
      <p>The CleavPredict uses PWMs as a primary mechanism for cleavage prediction. We determined PWMs for the following enzymes: MMP-2, -3, -8, -9, -10, -14, -15, -16, -24, -17, and -25. We selected MMPs representing four main groups of enzymes according to the phylogenetic tree that was already published in our [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127877.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] paper. Namely, we selected MMPs belonging to: a) a group containing simple hemopexin domain (MMP-3, MMP-8, MMP-10), b) gelatin binding MMPs (MMP-2, MMP-9), c) transmembrane MMPs (MMP-14, MMP-15, MMP-16, MMP-24), and d) GPI-linked MMPs (MMP-17, MMP-25). The PWMs were derived based on statistical analysis of enzyme specific substrates selected from phage display libraries. We used about 300 substrates for each MMP (<xref rid="pone.0127877.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Phage substrates are peptides containing constant flanking sequences (small letter) and variable six amino acid sequences (capital letters): ~ggsgPSA-LDAtasgaet~ (dash denominates the cleavage position) [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127877.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p>
      <p>The primary cleavage recognition method, derived for each individual MMP, has been obtained as follows. First, a set of phage substrates specific for a given MMP was selected. Then, the sequences of these substrates were aligned along the cleavage site and the frequencies (<italic>P</italic>(<italic>i</italic>
<sub><italic>AA</italic></sub>, <italic>j</italic>)) of occurrence of each amino acid type, <italic>i</italic>
<sub><italic>AA</italic></sub>, in each of the <italic>j-th</italic> position, ranging from P3 to P2’, were calculated. We use Schechter and Berger annotation for amino acid positions in substrates [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In Ref. [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] we demonstrated that the amino acids located at P3-P2’ positions are the most important in recognition of the substrates by MMP enzymes. Next, these frequencies at each position and amino acid were normalized by the distribution of amino acids in the set of background sequences.

      <p>If any element of the PWM is equal to zero, e.g. an amino acid type <italic>i</italic>
<sub><italic>AA</italic></sub> was not observed at the <italic>j-th</italic> position in phage substrates, then the <italic>offset</italic> value is used instead. From numerical point of view this is done in order to avoid calculation of infinite value of log<sub>2</sub>(0) and yet add the sufficient penalty to the scoring function when an amino acid type <italic>i</italic>
<sub><italic>AA</italic></sub> at <italic>j-th</italic> position is not observed in our learning set. The peptide bond is considered a cleavage site when the value of the score is above the <italic>threshold</italic> value. Both <italic>offset</italic> and <italic>threshold</italic> values are MMP specific and were derived using statistical analysis. This primary scoring function can be used to screen every peptide bond in test protein. The peptide bonds that have their score values above the <italic>threshold</italic> are considered to be potential cleavage sites.</p>
      <p>The magnitudes of <italic>offset</italic> in <xref rid="pone.0127877.e003" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq 3</xref>, and <italic>threshold</italic> are optimizable parameters of the method and are enzyme dependent. In order to establish their specific values for each MMP, we performed a series of 10-fold cross-validation calculations for a large set of <italic>offset</italic> and <italic>threshold</italic> values defined on two-dimensional grid. The optimal values of <italic>offset</italic> and <italic>threshold</italic> are those corresponding to the maximum value of F1-score. The F1 score is harmonic mean of precision and sensitivity in the machine learning theory. Our additional 10-fold cross-validation calculations demonstrated that extending the range of amino acid summation in <xref rid="pone.0127877.e002" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq 2</xref> beyond P3-P2’ positions does not change significantly the statistical evaluation metrics (results not shown).</p>
      <p>We performed 10-fold cross validation calculations for each set of MMP specific substrates in two stages. In the first stage, each set was divided into two groups in approximately 2:1 ratio. The larger group of substrates was used for cross validation, e.g. involving training and validation, while the smaller set was used for independent testing of the performance of optimized scoring parameters. This smaller set is termed an “internal” test.</p>
      <p>Next, we developed the final predictive model, in which for each MMP all available specific substrates were combined into the final training and validation sets, which were used for deriving the optimized values of <italic>thresholds</italic> and <italic>offsets</italic> parameters in 10-fold cross-validation. These are the values used for prediction cleavages in unknown targets incorporated in our web server. Combining all available data is a standard approach used to create the final prediction model for any “external” tests, as is described in Ref. [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The resultant log<sub>2</sub> values of the MMP specific PWM matrices are provided in <xref rid="pone.0127877.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>. These PWMs have been applied to “external” test cases, such as evaluation of the set of substrates collected in CutDB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cutdb.burnham.org">cutdb.burnham.org</ext-link>), and peptides determined as MMPs substrates by Overall <italic>et al</italic>.

      <title>External programs and databases used by CleavPredict Web server</title>
      <p>There are two main types of query inputs for testing protein substrates in the CleavPredict server: an amino acid sequence or a structure in the PDB format. In the case when an amino acid sequence is an input, the server provides information about predicted secondary structure and disorder regions for a substrate calculated by Jnet (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/www-jpred/legacy/jnet/">http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/www-jpred/legacy/jnet/</ext-link>) [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] and Disopred (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/">http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/</ext-link>) [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] programs, respectively. If a query input is a PDB structure then the secondary structure elements and solvent accessibility is calculated with the DSSP program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://swift.cmbi.ru.nl/gv/dssp/">http://swift.cmbi.ru.nl/gv/dssp/</ext-link>) [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127877.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>].

The TMHMM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/</ext-link>) [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] program is applied to predict the transmembrane domains.</p>
      <p>In the CleavPredict server, we implemented a link to COXPRESdb (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://coxpresdb.jp">http://coxpresdb.jp</ext-link>) [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] to determine the co-expression of a proteinase and a substrate. The average rank of this event is calculated based on the correlation score and average co-expression score. The average correlation score between the substrate and the proteinase in a gene expression pattern is retrieved and presented. We linked the Mentha (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mentha.uniroma2.it/about.php">http://mentha.uniroma2.it/about.php</ext-link>) [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] database to our Web server. It is used to determine whether the interaction between a proteinase and a substrate is reported in literature. Each interaction is assigned a reliability score (Mentha Score) that takes into account all the supporting evidence. The information about subcellular location and positions of SNPs is retrieved from the Uniprot resource portal and from the Humsavar database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/humsavar">http://www.uniprot.org/docs/humsavar</ext-link>) [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127877.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>].

      <title>CleavPredict Web server implementation</title>
      <p>The CleavPredict Web server has been implemented using Python under the web2py (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://web2py.com/book">http://web2py.com/book</ext-link>) framework and running on an Apache server on a Linux machine. The cleavage-site predictions by PWM have been automated by implementing in-house Fortran programs, integrated with Python scripts for processing. Javascript and html were used to present the final results on the user interface. The server offers two options for querying the Web server: a single substrate query, e.g., Uniprot id, Fasta sequence, PDB id, or PDB file; and a batch mode, where multiple Fasta sequences or multiple PDB files can be submitted. When a PDB structure or a Fasta sequence is submitted, the server uses standalone BLASTp against Uniprot and PDB to determine the corresponding Uniprot id. This Uniprot id is used to retrieve appropriate information about co-expression, co-localization, SNPs, PTMs, and structure of the substrate. The PDB structures are displayed at the end of user interface using GLmol (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://webglmol.sourceforge.jp">http://webglmol.sourceforge.jp</ext-link>). In order to display the PDB structure with all P1 positions of predicted cleavage sites and amino acids modified by the presence of SNPs and PTMs the Uniprot and PDB structure sequence numbering were mapped using the PDBSWS server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinf.org.uk/pdbsws/">http://www.bioinf.org.uk/pdbsws/</ext-link>) [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>].</p>
      <p>CleavPredict is currently configured on Apache/2.2.15 (CentOS) and Python2.6.6. The scripts are written in Python and Fortran, and the server uses a web2py framework. The web2py framework allows us to separate the components of our system into the model, the view, and the controller (MVC). The model represents the data of the application, the view specifies the user interface, and the controller handles the communication among all elements of the application. Computational time required for the cleavage site prediction depends on the size of a protein substrate but usually takes less then 30 seconds for a single case input.</p>

        <title>Analysis of proteome samples—external test</title>
        <p>As for the first external we choose two sets of peptide substrates identified by Overall <italic>et al</italic>. in proteome samples for MMP-2 and MMP-9 enzymes [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127877.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The first set of 1775 substrates for MMP-2 [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] reported in 2008, has been obtained by the proteomic identification of proteinases cleavage sites (PICS) method combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This approach when combined with bioinformatical analysis allows for identification of the prime side sequences of the cleaved peptides. The separate bioinformatical analysis is used to establish the non-prime sequences and then to deduct the position of the cleavage sites. The duration of the enzymatic reaction was chosen to vary between 1–16 h. In 2010 Prudova and Overall [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] proposed more advanced technique called iTRAQ-TAILS, that involves isotopic labelling of substrates. This technique was applied to study specificity of several enzymes, including MMP-2 and MMP-9, for which the authors identified 201 and 19 substrates, respectively. The sensitivity of the method depends on the statistically defined reporter ion ratio cutoff for MS/MS fragmentation in samples with and without the enzyme treatment. This cutoff was uniformly established using GluC enzyme, because its specificity is well known, and cutoff ratio can be validated. Thus, both methods produced the most comprehensive to date set of well-defined peptide substrates.</p>
        <p>We applied our prediction method to all reported peptides. The experimentally identified cleavage sites were considered to be a positive set while all other peptides bonds were negative set. We used CleavPredict to evaluate all peptide bonds in substrates and calculated the distribution of PWM score values for the positive and negative sets. The results are presented in Figs <xref rid="pone.0127877.g001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0127877.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. In each case the separation between the scores for negative and positive sets is significant. In the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test the value of D statistic is equal to 0.6.</p>

        <p>Experimental identification of cleavage positions in Ref. [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] depends on the accuracy of mass spectroscopy method and there is some level of ambiguity introduced by two separate bioinformatical procedures used for analysis of prime and non-prime product sequences. We hypothesize that the actual cleavage sites could be found within 1 to 4 peptides bonds next to the reported ones. Analysis of our prediction data showed it may be the case. We only include those peptide bonds that scored above the method threshold. We found 184 cleaved peptides bonds in the vicinity of experimentally identified ones that have PWM scores higher than the threshold and better match sequence patterns observed in our phage display experiment. When taking into account those new cleavage positions the discrimination between non-cleaved and cleaved peptide bonds becomes more pronounced (D value in KS test is 0.66), see <xref rid="pone.0127877.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> (“corrected” curve) and <xref rid="pone.0127877.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. This result, of course, does not preclude the biases in our approach. Understanding them would lead to the improvement of our algorithm. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that identification of the proper cleavage position in some substrates reported by Overall <italic>et al</italic>. could be revisited.</p>

        <p>Further on we validated our PWM—based scoring method in another “external” test performed on substrates collected in CutDB [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. We selected only those MMPs for which sufficient number of cleavage events and protein substrates is available. Thus, we applied our prediction algorithm to calculate scores for cleavage sites in substrates of five MMPs including: MMP-9 (334 cleavages in 88 unique substrates), MMP-2 (135 cleavages in 50 substrates), MMP-14 (89 cleavages in 38 substrates), MMP-3 (186 cleavages in 67 proteins) and MMP-8 (85 cleavages in 26 proteins). In these calculations, the positive set constitutes the cleavage sites reported in the literature (CutDB) for appropriate protein substrates for each MMP, while for the negative set we choose peptide bonds randomly selected from the same protein substrates that are not cleaved by MMP. The ratio of positive to negative cases is 1:100. The results of our prediction calculations are collected in <xref rid="pone.0127877.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. It demonstrates that for experimental protein substrates the PWM approach yields the accuracy reaching the level of 70% for most MMPs, while the false-positive rate is in the range of 30%, with the exception of MMP-8 and MMP-9 for which false-positive rate is 61 and 47%, respectively. The appropriate ROC curves are presented in <xref rid="pone.0127877.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>. Area under the curve (AUC) (<xref rid="pone.0127877.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), in most cases is well above 0.8, which demonstrate a good ability of our method to discriminate between cleavable and non-cleavable peptide bonds for MMP hydrolysis. The high level of false-positive rate is not satisfactory here and substantially higher than for uniformly identified substrates by Overall <italic>et al</italic>., as discussed above. However, we are aware that the reported cleavage sites come from highly heterogeneous sources and may not all be entirely accurate, either because denatured proteins were used as substrates, or because when the study was performed the methods for determining the position of the cleavage sites, including mass spectroscopy, were not as robust as methods available today. What is more important, the conditions used for studying cleavage events reported in the literature could differ substantially from those used in our phage display experiment. The conditions used in our high throughput phage display experiment allow measuring important cleavage events with observed k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> values above 3000 sec<sup>-1</sup>M<sup>-1</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Thus, if our predictive algorithm is sufficiently accurate, we may be able to identify the reported cleavage sites that are “suspect.”</p>

        <title>User input</title>
        <p>The user can submit either a single protein query in the interactive mode or a multi-protein query in the batch mode. In a single-protein-query mode, the input for a potential protein substrate can be provided in the form of a Uniprot accession number, a Fasta sequence, an uploaded PDB file, or a PDB id (<xref rid="pone.0127877.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>: Query Type). In the batch mode, the server accepts either a file containing multiple Fasta sequences, a list of multiple PDB ids (with a single space between each id), or multiple PDB files uploaded from a local computer. Once the input protein substrate(s) is/are defined, the user selects the MMP type from the list for which cleavage predictions will be calculated. The “Submit” button submits the input query for cleavage prediction calculations.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec014">
        <title>Outputs</title>
        <p>The two sections/tiers of the output data are summarized in <xref rid="pone.0127877.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>. All the results are shown in tabular form (see example in <xref rid="pone.0127877.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). The form of the first section of the output depends on the type of input query. When a query input is in the form of a protein sequence, then the first table contains a list of predicted P1 cleavage positions, 10 amino acid sequences around the cleavage site, a PWM score, the predicted secondary structure (alphahelix; ‘H’, beta-sheet; ‘E’. loop; ‘_’) and the predicted disorder (order: ‘.’; disorder ‘*’) characterizing this region of 10 amino acids. In addition, for each of these 10 amino acid positions, the server reports confidence scores of prediction in the range of 0–9, calculated by the Jnet and the Disopred programs. The confidence score is computed for every amino acid position, as a separate number. Thus, for ten amino acids fragment the server reports ten numbers in the form of a chain of consecutive values. The table also provides information about the presence of transmembrane domain for 10 amino acids region around the cleavage site, as predicted by the TMHMM program; and N-terminal and C-terminal mass fragments resultant from each cleavage event (<xref rid="pone.0127877.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, label: A).</p>

            <title>Snapshots of the result pages.</title>
            <p>As an example the prediction of the cleavage positions in Q15848 protein for MMP2 enzyme is demonstrated. This section contains information about signal peptide prediction, subcellular location, co-expression and co-localization information, known cleavages in CutDB, data on experimentally identified SNPs and PTMs, congregated into tables.</p>

          <graphic xlink:href="pone.0127877.g005"/>
        </fig>
        <p>When the PDB structure is a query input, the above-described table is partially modified. In this case, the server provides information about solvent accessibility of the cleavage site and actual secondary structure assignment, instead of predicted parameters. These properties are calculated by the DSSP program and provided in the CleavPredict result page for the region of 10 amino acids around the predicted cleavage sites.</p>
        <p>When the Uniprot id is not provided explicitly in the input query, the BLASTp is run internally against the Swissprot database to determine the Uniprot accession number. This number is necessary to retrieve other information about the query substrate, such as co-expression, co-localization, SNPs and PTMs from appropriate databases. In the case when the PDB id is provided as an input, PDB—Uniprot id mapping is used instead of BLASTp.</p>
        <p>The second section of the result page (<xref rid="pone.0127877.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>) contains information about: B) the distribution of masses after the cleavage via link to virtual mass spectroscopy results (VMS button. See Supporting Material Figure A in <xref rid="pone.0127877.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref> for example of an output from VMS); C) the presence of a signal peptide in the substrate, indicating whether it belongs to the set of secreted proteins; D) the subcellular localization of the substrate and the proteinase; E) the co-expression of the substrate and the proteinase retrieved from COXPRESSdb; F) the physical interaction between the substrate and the enzyme retrieved from the Mentha database; G) known cleavages in the query substrate retrieved from CutDB, that can be used for making comparison with CleavPredict predictions, and H) known SNPs, with disease annotation, when available, and PTMs in the substrate. Additionally, for user convenience, the server displays sequences of the query substrate in the Fasta format and color-code the predicted cleavages, SNPs, and PTMs (Supporting Material Figure B in <xref rid="pone.0127877.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). This information is also displayed in the PDB structure, if it is available, using the GLmol viewer.</p>
        <p>In the batch mode, results of the calculations can be downloaded from the server or may be sent to the user’s e-mail address that is optionally provided at the time of query input.</p>

    <title>Conclusions and Future Developments</title>
    <p>We will continue to integrate more proteinases into our CleavPredict Web server. This includes thrombin, furin, caspases, and others for which large set of substrates could be extracted from the literature, from the MEROPS database [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], or from our own effort aimed at high-throughput profiling of proteinases [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127877.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. We will work toward integrating PWMs with structural elements information into a single unified scoring function that will be used for discrimination between cleaved and non-cleaved peptide bonds. Initial work toward this goal has been already published recently [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127877.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. For many proteins, the 3D structure is not available. Instead of relying on prediction of secondary structure elements, we will incorporate a mechanism that can be used to build a homology model for the potential substrate. Homology modelling will be performed using the FFAS server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ffas.burnham.org">ffas.burnham.org</ext-link>). Our computational platform can be further extended by connecting predicted cleavage events to the chain of other events using a library of pathways and networks. The combined knowledge of the position of cleavage sites, SNPs and PTMs in the vicinity of cleavage sites, as well as knowledge of pathways and networks could be used to discover relationships between aberrant proteolytic events and potential disease or syndromes. The main problem with most, if not all, prediction methods is over-prediction of the substrates. In the case of MMPs—this problem is partially related to their broad and overlapping specificity.</p>
    <p>We believe that CleavPredict can become a versatile hypothesis generator guiding future experiments in basic and transitional medical research. The CleavPredict has been already successfully applied to several practical scientific projects related to discovery of new MMPs substrates and helped in interpreting experimental findings [<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0127877.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p>
