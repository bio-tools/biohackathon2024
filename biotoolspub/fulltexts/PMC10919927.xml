      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have led to a substantial increase in the availability of population genetic variant data, thus prompting the development of various population analysis tools to enhance our understanding of population structure and evolution. The tools that are currently used to analyze population genetic variant data generally require different environments, parameters, and formats of the input data, which can act as a barrier preventing the wide-spread usage of such tools by general researchers who may not be familiar with bioinformatics. To address this problem, we have developed an automated and comprehensive pipeline called PAPipe to perform nine widely used population genetic analyses using population NGS data. PAPipe seamlessly interconnects and serializes multiple steps, such as read trimming and mapping, genetic variant calling, data filtering, and format converting, along with nine population genetic analyses such as principal component analysis, phylogenetic analysis, population tree analysis, population structure analysis, linkage disequilibrium decay analysis, selective sweep analysis, population admixture analysis, sequentially Markovian coalescent analysis, and fixation index analysis. PAPipe also provides an easy-to-use web interface that allows for the parameters to be set and the analysis results to be browsed in intuitive manner. PAPipe can be used to generate extensive results that provide insights that can help enhance user convenience and data usability.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Population genetics is the study of genetic similarities and differences within and between populations (<xref rid="msae040-B36" ref-type="bibr">Nei 1975</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B8" ref-type="bibr">Casillas and Barbadilla 2017</xref>). The discovery of genetic variations represented by population allele frequencies as well as comparisons of population profiles of genetic variations from different perspectives both play important roles in this field of study. Based on the theory of modern synthesis, which integrates Darwinian evolution and Mendelian genetics, the concept of evolution can be defined by changes in allele frequency (<xref rid="msae040-B14" ref-type="bibr">Dannemann et al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B21" ref-type="bibr">Franchini et al. 2020</xref>). Accordingly, population genetic variant data can be used to make inferences regarding evolution within populations by estimating genetic structure, phylogenetic relationships, and effective population size (<xref rid="msae040-B37" ref-type="bibr">Nishiyama et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B21" ref-type="bibr">Franchini et al. 2020</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B30" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2020b</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B46" ref-type="bibr">Reimer et al. 2020</xref>). Inference and estimation of population structure and characteristics can be used in various studies, such as population immunity studies (<xref rid="msae040-B15" ref-type="bibr">Daub et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B3" ref-type="bibr">Barreiro and Quintana-Murci 2020</xref>), etiology studies (<xref rid="msae040-B18" ref-type="bibr">Di Rienzo 2006</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B48" ref-type="bibr">Torkamani et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B40" ref-type="bibr">Parkes et al. 2013</xref>), studies on population-specific diseases (<xref rid="msae040-B5" ref-type="bibr">Bhatia et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B56" ref-type="bibr">Zhong et al. 2020</xref>), studies investigating domesticated animals (<xref rid="msae040-B39" ref-type="bibr">Parker et al. 2017</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B10" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2018</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B20" ref-type="bibr">Fitak et al. 2020</xref>), and population migration studies (<xref rid="msae040-B11" ref-type="bibr">Choudhury et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B39" ref-type="bibr">Parker et al. 2017</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B7" ref-type="bibr">Browning et al. 2018</xref>).</p>
    <p>Developments in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have made it easy and cost-effective to generate vast amounts of high-quality, individual genome sequencing data. Moreover, continued advancement in NGS technologies have resulted in the accumulation of population sequencing data. Therefore, various tools have been developed for applications in population genetic analyses. Because population genetics is based on genetic similarities and differences within and between populations, population genetic analyses generally begin by examining population genetic variant data (<xref rid="msae040-B33" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B51" ref-type="bibr">Van der Auwera et al. 2013</xref>), which represent fundamental inputs in various downstream analyses, such as phylogenetic tree inference, principal component analysis (PCA), and population structure analysis. In many studies, different types of population genetic analyses have been combined in attempts to comprehensively understand the target populations and draw meaningful conclusions (<xref rid="msae040-B4" ref-type="bibr">Baumsteiger et al. 2017</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B29" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2017</xref>, <xref rid="msae040-B28" ref-type="bibr">2020a</xref>).</p>
    <p>However, calling population genetic variants from population sequencing data is a complex task, because it requires multiple tools to be run, with each tool requiring a specific running environment and several preprocessing steps to appropriately prepare the input data. Further, after obtaining the population genetic variant data, differential formatting of the genetic variant data is needed for different population genetic analysis tools, which also requires specific running environment and particular parameter settings. These limitations pose challenges for researchers who are not familiar with bioinformatics.</p>
    <p>To address these challenges, recent efforts have generated simple pipelines by combining multiple tasks. For example, a number of studies have developed several different genetic variant-calling pipelines (<xref rid="msae040-B52" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B38" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B22" ref-type="bibr">Ip et al. 2020</xref>) by combining multiple steps in genetic variant calling such that they are executed by a single command. Another pipeline-building study for population structure analysis (<xref rid="msae040-B35" ref-type="bibr">Mussmann et al. 2020</xref>) has developed ADMIXPIPE. This combines multiple tasks such as the filtering of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), running the ADMIXTURE program (<xref rid="msae040-B1" ref-type="bibr">Alexander et al. 2009</xref>), and visualizing population structures with the CLUMPAK program (<xref rid="msae040-B23" ref-type="bibr">Kopelman et al. 2015</xref>) to facilitate population structure analysis. Unfortunately, those pipelines were only developed to handle specific analyses such as genetic variant calling or population structure analyses. Other efforts aiming to bridge between lower-level manipulation of population sequencing data and higher-level applications of population genetic variants have resulted in the development of a pipeline platform. For example, the Pop-Gen Pipeline Platform (PPP) (<xref rid="msae040-B53" ref-type="bibr">Webb et al. 2021</xref>) has been implemented as a software platform to support several sets of scripts for VCF file processing, data manipulation, file format conversion, and five population genetic analyses. However, PPP only provides modulated functions that can be used as building blocks in constructing a whole pipeline, so the burden of running a series of scripts to conduct population genetic analyses remains. Moreover, population genetic variant data must be available before using the PPP.</p>
    <p>To address the above problems, in this study we present an automated pipeline called PAPipe for comprehensive population genetic analyses that use population NGS data as input. PAPipe consists of five main steps: read trimming, read mapping, genetic variant calling, data filtering and format converting, and analysis result generating. With only the population sequencing data and appropriate configuration of parameters, PAPipe enables automated result generation from nine population genetic analyses: PCA, phylogenetic analysis, population tree analysis, population structure analysis, linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay analysis, selective sweep analysis, population admixture analysis, sequentially Markovian coalescent analysis, and fixation index analysis. Moreover, to enhance user convenience, PAPipe provides default parameters for every step, and researchers can change these parameters using an easy-to-use web interface. When researchers have intermediate data, such as read alignment data or genetic variant call data in advance, they can use such data as intermediate input for further downstream analysis. PAPipe also provides a web interface for easily browsing analysis results.</p>
    <p>PAPipe is designed to generate results from extensive population genetic analyses to promote discussion and improve the utilization of population whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. Therefore, PAPipe is expected to be very useful for gaining in-depth insight for target populations. PAPipe is implemented for the Linux operating system, and Docker image files are provided to reduce the challenges associated with environment settings.

    <title>New Approaches</title>
    <p>The PAPipe was designed as a comprehensive pipeline with which to generate results of various population genetic analyses using raw WGS reads. The PAPipe features the seamless connection of five main steps: read trimming, read mapping, genetic variant calling, data filtering and format converting, and analysis result generating step. It can be run using a single command (<xref rid="msae040-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The analysis result generating step generates high-quality visualizations of the results of nine population genetic analyses: PCA, phylogenetic analysis, population tree analysis, population structure analysis, LD decay analysis, selective sweep analysis, population admixture analysis, sequentially Markovian coalescent analysis, and fixation index analysis. Therefore, PAPipe allows researchers to easily perform the above nine population genetic analyses all at once. In addition to this high-level automation of analyses, PAPipe is flexible and can be customized by users. For example, users can easily (i) skip some steps in PAPipe if they want to use pregenerated data, (ii) choose analysis programs in the read mapping and genetic variant calling steps, (iii) perform some subset of the nine population genetic analyses in the analysis result generating step if they so desire, (iv) change the parameters of all analysis tools included in PAPipe using an easy-to-use web interface, and (v) browse the analysis results using another easy-to-use web interface. The Materials and Methods section provides further details of each step in PAPipe.</p>

      <title>Clustering of Cattle Populations Based on Genetic Signatures</title>
      <p>PAPipe can calculate principal components (PCs) and their proportion of variance explained (PVE) using identified SNPs in the PCA step. For top PCs whose sum of PVEs is greater than 80%, PCA plots for all pairs of PCs are then generated. We used PAPipe to cluster these five cattle populations based on the genetic signatures represented by the identified SNPs. In this analysis, the top 14 PCs were selected and 91 PCA plots were created (<xref rid="msae040-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a and b</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material</xref> online). Based on the PCA plot between PC1 and PC2 (<xref rid="msae040-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), all five cattle breeds could clearly be separated from each other, with Holstein and Simmental being relatively close to each other, consistent with observation in a previous study (<xref rid="msae040-B26" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2016</xref>). Hanwoo was the most distinct population in terms of PC1. Additional characteristics can be discovered by observing other PCA plots. For example, Angus and Jersey were placed very closely in the PCA plot between PC1 and PC4 (<xref rid="msae040-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). This may indicate that Angus and Jersey share some genetic features. As shown above, the identified PCs and multiple PCA plots automatically produced by PAPipe can help researchers to find interesting clustering patterns from multiple angles through different PCs.</p>

      <title>Discovering Phylogenetic Relationships Among Cattle Populations</title>
      <p>PAPipe can predict phylogenetic relationships among individuals in given populations and draw a phylogenetic tree using SNPs in the phylogenetic analysis step. <xref rid="msae040-F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref> shows a phylogenetic tree generated by PAPipe, which represents the relationships among individuals in the five cattle populations. As shown in <xref rid="msae040-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, most individuals from the same cattle breed were grouped together. Specifically, the Angus, Holstein, and Simmental populations were placed closer to each other than the other two populations, which is consistent with the PCA plot shown in <xref rid="msae040-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>. Interestingly, one Holstein individual (Holstein9) was predicted to belong to the Simmental population.</p>

      <title>Inferring the Ancestry of Cattle Populations based on Population Structure</title>
      <p>PAPipe can analyze the structure of given populations and draw population structure plots using different K values (which range from 2 to 5 by default) and SNPs in the population structure analysis step. Researchers can easily trace the ancestry of populations by comparing multiple plots generated by PAPipe with different K values together. The structures of the cattle populations were examined by PAPipe, and the generated plots with K values ranging from 2 to 5 were compared (<xref rid="msae040-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). When K = 2, Jersey was clearly distinguished from the other four populations. Holstein and Simmental remained highly similar to each other with the K values ranging from 2 to 4, which is consistent with the results shown in <xref rid="msae040-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a to c</xref>. Angus (with K values ranging from 3 to 5) and Hanwoo (with K values ranging from 4 to 5) were found to have relatively isolated ancestries, which is similar to the results of a previous study (<xref rid="msae040-B26" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2016</xref>).</p>

      <title>Comparing the Recombination Patterns of Cattle Populations</title>
      <p>PAPipe can compare the patterns of LD of populations and create plots by examining pairs of SNPs separated by a range of distances (maximum distance 500 Kbp, 1 Mbp, 5 Mbp, and 10 Mbp by default) in the LD decay analysis step. PAPipe was used to compare recombination patterns of the cattle populations (<xref rid="msae040-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a and b</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary fig. S2, Supplementary Material</xref> online). Jersey showed the most dramatic decay of LD between pairs of SNPs closer than 100 Kbp while the patterns of the other four populations were highly similar to each other. With increasing distance between SNP pairs, Hanwoo and Simmental were found to be separated from Angus and Holstein, while the decay patterns of Angus and Holstein became almost indistinguishable from each other (<xref rid="msae040-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p>

      <title>Identifying the Mode of Admixture Among Cattle Populations</title>
      <p>PAPipe can calculate various statistics, such as <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM1" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM2" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, and <italic toggle="yes">D</italic>, which can help identify the mode of admixture for all possible combinations of populations using SNPs in the population admixture analysis step. Using PAPipe, those population admixture statistics were calculated and compared for all possible combinations of the five cattle populations (<xref rid="msae040-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary tables S2 to S5, Supplementary Material</xref> online).

      <title>Inferring the Trajectory of the Effective Population Sizes of Cattle Populations</title>
      <p>PAPipe can perform pairwise and multiple sequentially Markovian coalescent (PSMC and MSMC, respectively) analyses using the identified SNPs and then draw a plot showing the changes in the effective population sizes of the populations in the sequentially Markovian coalescent analysis step. Using this function of PAPipe, the trajectory of the effective population size of each cattle population was predicted and compared by the PSMC analysis (<xref rid="msae040-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). At around a million years ago, the effective population sizes of all cattle populations were highly similar to each other. However, after that time point, there were increases in both the effective population sizes of all cattle populations and their variances. The effective population sizes of Simmental and Hanwoo showed the most dramatic changes. This pattern was observed by around one hundred thousand years ago. An overall decrease in the effective population size was then followed for all cattle populations.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>We developed PAPipe, a pipeline enabling comprehensive population genetic analysis. PAPipe automates a series of steps, including read trimming, read mapping, genetic variant calling, data filtering and format converting, and analysis result generating via nine population genetic analyses, such as PCA, phylogenetic analysis, population tree analysis, population structure analysis, LD decay analysis, selective sweep analysis, population admixture analysis, sequentially Markovian coalescent analysis, and fixation index analysis. The utility of PAPipe was demonstrated with a public dataset of cattle, and analysis results and publication-level figures were successfully generated.</p>
    <p>PAPipe allows researchers to focus on analyzing the results, rather than having to spend large amounts of time executing individual programs, by automating the running of interconnected analysis programs. Despite the convenience of automated and default settings in PAPipe, some default parameters are not appropriate for specific analyses. Because of this, PAPipe is designed to allow researchers to easily modify specific parameters and browse the analysis results using an easy-to-use web interface. The current version of PAPipe only contains nine population genetic analyses. However, PAPipe will be continuously revised to include updated versions of existing tools in PAPipe or new population genetic analysis tools to increase the utility of PAPipe in various types of population genetic studies.</p>

      <title>Details of Each Step in PAPipe</title>
      <sec id="msae040-s4.1.1">
        <title>Read Trimming Step</title>
        <p>PAPipe checks the quality of input NGS reads and trims them if necessary. This step consists of three sub-steps: assessing the quality of raw reads, trimming raw reads, and accessing the quality of trimmed reads. The quality of reads was assessed by FastQC (v 0.11.9) (<xref rid="msae040-B2" ref-type="bibr">Andrews 2010</xref>), while the web page to be browsed for summary statistics was generated by MultiQC (v 1.9) (<xref rid="msae040-B19" ref-type="bibr">Ewels et al. 2016</xref>). Read trimming is processed by TrimGalore (v 0.6.0) (<xref rid="msae040-B24" ref-type="bibr">Krueger et al. 2019</xref>) which is a commonly used program for trimming sequencing data. This step is typically used to enhance the data accuracy and improve the efficiency of subsequent population analysis.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="msae040-s4.1.2">
        <title>Read Mapping Step</title>
        <p>To obtain a set of genetic variants, NGS reads need to be aligned to reference genome sequences. PAPipe was constructed to use one of the two mapping tools BWA (v 0.7.17-r1188) (<xref rid="msae040-B31" ref-type="bibr">Li and Durbin 2009</xref>) and Bowtie 2 (v 2.3.4.3) (<xref rid="msae040-B25" ref-type="bibr">Langmead and Salzberg 2012</xref>) that are widely chosen by users to perform this task. Read mapping of the data is then processed with the Picard Toolkit (v 2.17.11) (<xref rid="msae040-B6" ref-type="bibr">Broad Institute 2018</xref>) to identify duplicates with the “MarkDuplicates” module and process read groups with the “AddOrReplaceReadGroups” module. Users can easily modify the parameter file of PAPipe to change or add parameters for each process. The read mapping step can also be skipped if users have prepared their own read alignment data.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="msae040-s4.1.3">
        <title>Genetic Variant Calling Step</title>
        <p>Similar to the read mapping step, PAPipe was designed to use one of three pipelines based on three tools, Genome Analysis ToolKit 3 (GATK3 v 3.8-1) (<xref rid="msae040-B17" ref-type="bibr">DePristo et al. 2011</xref>), Genome Analysis ToolKit 4 (GATK4 v 4.1.7.0), and BCFtools (v 1.9) (<xref rid="msae040-B33" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 2009</xref>), which are often selected by users to call genetic variants from NGS read alignments.</p>
        <p>Two GATK-based pipelines were constructed based on the GATK Best Practices Workflow for Germline short variant discovery (<xref rid="msae040-B51" ref-type="bibr">Van der Auwera et al. 2013</xref>). However, the two GATK-based pipelines have different alignment preprocessing steps. In the case of the pipeline based on GATK3 (v 3.8-1), the following processes are performed sequentially to realign and recalibrate reads: Picard (v 2.17.11) “ReorderSam”, GATK “RealignerTargetCreator”, “IndelRealigner”, “BaseRecalibrator”, and “PrintReads”. Meanwhile, the pipeline based on GATK4 (v 4.1.7.0), only read recalibration was implemented with GATK “BaseRecalibrator” and “ApplyBQSR”.</p>
        <p>The genetic variant calling process shared by the two GATK-based pipelines is executed after the alignment preprocessing step. Specifically, “HaplotypeCaller” calls genetic variants per sample to generate single-sample GVCF files, while “CombineGVCFs” combines single-sample GVCF files into a single-merged GVCF file. Next, “GenotypeGVCFs” is used for joint genotyping and to generate the first genotype VCF file containing all SNPs and insertions and deletions (indels). “SelectVariants” is used to differentiate between SNPs and indels, thereby leaving only SNPs in the VCF file. In this process, the dbSNP parameter (–dbsnp) can be used to annotate SNPs with user-provided data from the dbSNP database. Finally, the two GATK-based pipelines were constructed to only extract SNPs that pass the hard filtering criteria: QD &lt; 2.0, QUAL &lt; 30.0, SOR &gt; 3.0, FS &gt; 60.0, MQ &lt; 40.0, MQRankSum &lt; −12.5, and ReadPosRankSum &lt; −8.0.</p>
        <p>The BCFtools-based pipeline was developed to directly process read alignment files without the need for additional preprocessing steps. SAMtools (v 1.9-36-gb6fea3c) “mpileup” is used to combine multiple files containing the alignments of a single sample into a single BCF file. The parameter “-g” is used to group nonvariant sites into gVCF blocks according to the minimum per-sample read depth during the “mpileup” process. The BCFtools (v 1.9) “call” function is then used to call SNPs and indels with parameters “-c and -v”. Finally, the “vcfutils.pl” varFilter” is used to discard indels and filter SNPs according to the following default filtering criteria: d = 2, D = 10000000, a = 2, W = 10, Q = 10, w = 3, 1 = 1e−4, 2 = 1e−100, 3 = 0, 4 = 1e−4, G = 0, S = 1000, and e = 1e−4. The VCFtool “–tstv-by-count” command is also executed to additionally calculate the Ti/Tv ratio.</p>
        <p>Similar to the read mapping step, users can change or add parameters for each process by modifying the parameter file of PAPipe. It is also possible for users to skip this genetic variant calling step if they prefer to use their own genetic variant data.</p>

      <sec id="msae040-s4.1.4">
        <title>Data Filtering and Format Converting Step</title>
        <p>Genetic variant analysis tools require their own input data format. PAPipe provides a data filtering and format converting step to overcome this potential issue and thus facilitate the seamless execution of nine population genetic analysis tools. PLINK (v 1.9) (<xref rid="msae040-B44" ref-type="bibr">Purcell et al. 2007</xref>), VCFtools (v 0.1.17) (<xref rid="msae040-B13" ref-type="bibr">Danecek et al. 2011</xref>), and an in-house Perl script are used to execute three different treatments. PLINK is used to filter SNPs and convert the file format to the plink binary format (BED) using the following default parameters: –geno 0.01, –maf 0.05, –hwe 0.000001, –make-bed. VCFtools (v 0.1.17) is used to convert the file format of genetic variants to the plink format (PED). PAPipe also provides an in-house Perl script to convert the file format of genetic variants to HapMap format (HAPMAP). As in the previous steps, parameters can be changed or added by modifying the PAPipe parameter file.</p>

        <title>Analysis Result Generating Step</title>
        <p>By using data generated from the previous steps as input, PAPipe can run several tools for the following nine population genetic analyses: PCA, phylogenetic analysis, population tree analysis, population structure analysis, LD decay analysis, selective sweep analysis, population admixture analysis, sequentially Markovian coalescent analysis, and fixation index analysis. All nine analyses can be run with default parameters provided by PAPipe. It is also possible to only run some subset of the tools, if so desired by the user. Details of the supported analyses run by PAPipe are explained in the following.</p>
        <sec id="msae040-s4.1.5.1">
          <title>Principal Component Analysis</title>
          <p>PCA is a basic analysis for examining population structure by identifying a relationship between different populations. It is implemented in two steps: (i) identifying PCs using the population genetic variant dataset and (ii) drawing 2D plots for two different PCs. Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (v 1.26.0) (<xref rid="msae040-B54" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al. 2011</xref>) or PLINK (v 2.00a5) (<xref rid="msae040-B9" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al. 2015</xref>) can be used to perform the PCA analysis, while an in-house R script is used for visualization. Our PCA analysis pipeline generates multiple 2D plots comprising all possible pairs of two different PCs whose sum of variance exceeds some given percentage (where the default value is set at 80%). Users can also limit the number of generated plots using the “maxPC” parameter.</p>

        <sec id="msae040-s4.1.5.2">
          <title>Phylogenetic Analysis</title>
          <p>A phylogenetic tree can be used to infer the evolutionary history of populations using the genetic variant dataset. SNPhylo (v 20180901) (<xref rid="msae040-B27" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2014</xref>) is used to generate a phylogenetic tree from genetic variant data in the HapMap format. The constructed trees are presented as a text file in Newick (NWK) format, alongside figures of unrooted tree.</p>

          <title>Population Tree Analysis</title>
          <p>Treemix (v 1.13) (<xref rid="msae040-B43" ref-type="bibr">Pickrell and Pritchard 2012</xref>) was integrated into PAPipe to infer historical relationships among populations based on genetic admixtures. Treemix requires proper variant filtration and LD pruning as an initial step for generating input data. The variant filtration is performed using VCFtools (v 0.1.17) with the “-max-missing 1” parameter by default, while the LD pruning is executed using the script provided by Treemix (v 1.13) with the “ldPruning 0.1” parameter by default. Subsequently, Treemix (v 1.13) is executed with the default parameters, aside from “-k 500” meaning 500 SNPs per block and multiple values of the “-m” parameter representing the number of migration events used in estimating the tree. The default value of the “-m” parameter is 0, but PAPipe enables repeated execution of Treemix using a range of “-m” values from 0 to a user-provided value.</p>

        <sec id="msae040-s4.1.5.4">
          <title>Population Structure Analysis</title>
          <p>The population structure can be analyzed by estimating the proportion of ancestral origins in the individual admixture. In PAPipe, ADMIXTURE (v 1.3.0) (<xref rid="msae040-B1" ref-type="bibr">Alexander et al. 2009</xref>) is used to estimate individual ancestry, while CLUMPAK (v 1.1) (<xref rid="msae040-B23" ref-type="bibr">Kopelman et al. 2015</xref>) is used to visualize the results. Parameter K, which is the number of inferred ancestral species for clustering, is required to run ADMIXTURE. Users typically perform this analysis multiple times with different K values and then use the most reliable result. Therefore, PAPipe accepts a single parameter value k (5 for default) for K and automatically performs this analysis k − 1 times using 2 through k as the K value. This generates k − 1 admixture plots for different K values.</p>

        <sec id="msae040-s4.1.5.5">
          <title>LD Decay Analysis</title>
          <p>LD is a nonrandom association of alleles at two or more different loci. Various factors can affect LD, including the recombination rate, population structure, and number of generations. Therefore, a decay of LD represents a history of population recombination. In this analysis, PopLDdecay (v 3.31) (<xref rid="msae040-B55" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. 2019</xref>) is used to calculate a pairwise measure of LD ( <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM11" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>). Given a maximum distance as a parameter value, PopLDdecay calculates <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM12" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> values from all available pairs of SNPs located within the maximum distance.

PAPipe runs PopLDdecay several times using different maximum distances (500 Kbp, 1 Mbp, 5 Mbp, and 10 Mbp by default).</p>

          <title>Sequentially Markovian Coalescent Analysis</title>
          <p>One of the ultimate objectives of population genetic analysis is to elucidate the evolutional history of populations by identifying the relationship among populations (<xref rid="msae040-B34" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Hansen 2017</xref>). To this end, effective population size has been used to track the demographic history of populations chronologically. PAPipe utilizes PSMC (v 0.6.5) (<xref rid="msae040-B32" ref-type="bibr">Li and Durbin 2011</xref>) analysis and MSMC (v 2.0.0) (<xref rid="msae040-B47" ref-type="bibr">Schiffels and Durbin 2014</xref>) analysis to estimate the effective population size of a specific population and determine whether it underwent expansion or contraction during its evolution.</p>
          <p>PSMC analysis, which involves inferring the effective population size from a single diploid genome, has in the past been widely used to estimate demographic history from individual genomes. However, the MSMC analysis, which can simultaneously utilize multiple individuals, has emerged as an effective alternative approach.</p>
          <p>The PSMC analysis in PAPipe was implemented in three steps: (i) processing input data, (ii) generating PSMC results, and (iii) visualization. In the first step, read alignment files are merged and processed to create a single alignment file in the PSMCFA format by SAMtools (v 1.9-36-gb6fea3c) mpileup with the “-C 50” parameter, vcfutils vcf2fq with the “-d 10” parameter, and BCFtools (v 1.9) view with the “-D 100” parameter. After the input data are prepared, PSMC (v 0.6.5) is run with the default parameters. Subsequently, plots are generated using the script obtained from PSMC.</p>
          <p>In the case of the MSMC analysis, read alignment files are prepared in the MSMCFA format by SAMtools (v 1.9-36-gb6fea3c) mpileup with the “-C 50” parameter, BCFtools (v 1.9) call with the “-c and -V indel” parameter, and bamCaller.py in MSMC. Then, MSMC (v 2.0.0) is executed with the default parameters, and the final plots are generated using an in-house visualization script.</p>

          <p>To identify genomic regions showing with exceptional genetic variations in target populations, PAPipe uses VCFtools (v 0.1.17) (<xref rid="msae040-B13" ref-type="bibr">Danecek et al. 2011</xref>) to calculate the <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM23" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> value which is a measure of population differentiation. <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM24" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> estimation requires the size of a sliding window and the size of sliding step of that window. The default values are 100 Kbp for both the sizes of the sliding window and the sliding step. The <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM25" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> value is calculated based on a pair of population subsets.

Users can also change target populations by modifying the population group parameter. For example, if two out of four populations are set as target populations in the parameter, PAPipe only executes the analysis once to calculates <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM27" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> values by comparing the target populations against the remaining ones.

      <title>Usability and Accessibility of PAPipe</title>
      <p>PAPipe has been designed with a focus on user-friendliness, and it incorporates several features with the intention of to enhancing usability. (i) A web page for setting program parameters: PAPipe provides researchers with a web page (<ext-link xlink:href="http://bioinfo.konkuk.ac.kr/PAPipe/parameter_builder/" ext-link-type="uri">http://bioinfo.konkuk.ac.kr/PAPipe/parameter_builder/</ext-link>) on which they can set various program parameters within a visual web interface, which then automatically generates the desired parameter file. (ii) A web page for browsing pipeline output: PAPipe provides a web page summarizing all generated output from all population analyses. (iii) A small test dataset for easily understanding the pipeline: PAPipe provides a small test dataset and parameter file, thus helping researchers understand how to best prepare the input data and parameter files. (iv) Increased parallelization level of the pipeline: the whole pipeline of PAPipe has been optimized for performance by automatically conducting fork management for all feasible components, with the ultimate aim of enhancing execution speed. The running time and disk usage of each part in PAPipe as a function of the number of threads were measured using the test dataset (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary table S6, Supplementary Material</xref> online). Users can use this information to choose appropriate analyses based on their available time and computer resources.</p>

      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have led to a substantial increase in the availability of population genetic variant data, thus prompting the development of various population analysis tools to enhance our understanding of population structure and evolution. The tools that are currently used to analyze population genetic variant data generally require different environments, parameters, and formats of the input data, which can act as a barrier preventing the wide-spread usage of such tools by general researchers who may not be familiar with bioinformatics. To address this problem, we have developed an automated and comprehensive pipeline called PAPipe to perform nine widely used population genetic analyses using population NGS data. PAPipe seamlessly interconnects and serializes multiple steps, such as read trimming and mapping, genetic variant calling, data filtering, and format converting, along with nine population genetic analyses such as principal component analysis, phylogenetic analysis, population tree analysis, population structure analysis, linkage disequilibrium decay analysis, selective sweep analysis, population admixture analysis, sequentially Markovian coalescent analysis, and fixation index analysis. PAPipe also provides an easy-to-use web interface that allows for the parameters to be set and the analysis results to be browsed in intuitive manner. PAPipe can be used to generate extensive results that provide insights that can help enhance user convenience and data usability.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Population genetics is the study of genetic similarities and differences within and between populations (<xref rid="msae040-B36" ref-type="bibr">Nei 1975</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B8" ref-type="bibr">Casillas and Barbadilla 2017</xref>). The discovery of genetic variations represented by population allele frequencies as well as comparisons of population profiles of genetic variations from different perspectives both play important roles in this field of study. Based on the theory of modern synthesis, which integrates Darwinian evolution and Mendelian genetics, the concept of evolution can be defined by changes in allele frequency (<xref rid="msae040-B14" ref-type="bibr">Dannemann et al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B21" ref-type="bibr">Franchini et al. 2020</xref>). Accordingly, population genetic variant data can be used to make inferences regarding evolution within populations by estimating genetic structure, phylogenetic relationships, and effective population size (<xref rid="msae040-B37" ref-type="bibr">Nishiyama et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B21" ref-type="bibr">Franchini et al. 2020</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B30" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2020b</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B46" ref-type="bibr">Reimer et al. 2020</xref>). Inference and estimation of population structure and characteristics can be used in various studies, such as population immunity studies (<xref rid="msae040-B15" ref-type="bibr">Daub et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B3" ref-type="bibr">Barreiro and Quintana-Murci 2020</xref>), etiology studies (<xref rid="msae040-B18" ref-type="bibr">Di Rienzo 2006</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B48" ref-type="bibr">Torkamani et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B40" ref-type="bibr">Parkes et al. 2013</xref>), studies on population-specific diseases (<xref rid="msae040-B5" ref-type="bibr">Bhatia et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B56" ref-type="bibr">Zhong et al. 2020</xref>), studies investigating domesticated animals (<xref rid="msae040-B39" ref-type="bibr">Parker et al. 2017</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B10" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2018</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B20" ref-type="bibr">Fitak et al. 2020</xref>), and population migration studies (<xref rid="msae040-B11" ref-type="bibr">Choudhury et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B39" ref-type="bibr">Parker et al. 2017</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B7" ref-type="bibr">Browning et al. 2018</xref>).</p>
    <p>Developments in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have made it easy and cost-effective to generate vast amounts of high-quality, individual genome sequencing data. Moreover, continued advancement in NGS technologies have resulted in the accumulation of population sequencing data. Therefore, various tools have been developed for applications in population genetic analyses. Because population genetics is based on genetic similarities and differences within and between populations, population genetic analyses generally begin by examining population genetic variant data (<xref rid="msae040-B33" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B51" ref-type="bibr">Van der Auwera et al. 2013</xref>), which represent fundamental inputs in various downstream analyses, such as phylogenetic tree inference, principal component analysis (PCA), and population structure analysis. In many studies, different types of population genetic analyses have been combined in attempts to comprehensively understand the target populations and draw meaningful conclusions (<xref rid="msae040-B4" ref-type="bibr">Baumsteiger et al. 2017</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B29" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2017</xref>, <xref rid="msae040-B28" ref-type="bibr">2020a</xref>).</p>
    <p>However, calling population genetic variants from population sequencing data is a complex task, because it requires multiple tools to be run, with each tool requiring a specific running environment and several preprocessing steps to appropriately prepare the input data. Further, after obtaining the population genetic variant data, differential formatting of the genetic variant data is needed for different population genetic analysis tools, which also requires specific running environment and particular parameter settings. These limitations pose challenges for researchers who are not familiar with bioinformatics.</p>
    <p>To address these challenges, recent efforts have generated simple pipelines by combining multiple tasks. For example, a number of studies have developed several different genetic variant-calling pipelines (<xref rid="msae040-B52" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B38" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B22" ref-type="bibr">Ip et al. 2020</xref>) by combining multiple steps in genetic variant calling such that they are executed by a single command. Another pipeline-building study for population structure analysis (<xref rid="msae040-B35" ref-type="bibr">Mussmann et al. 2020</xref>) has developed ADMIXPIPE. This combines multiple tasks such as the filtering of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), running the ADMIXTURE program (<xref rid="msae040-B1" ref-type="bibr">Alexander et al. 2009</xref>), and visualizing population structures with the CLUMPAK program (<xref rid="msae040-B23" ref-type="bibr">Kopelman et al. 2015</xref>) to facilitate population structure analysis. Unfortunately, those pipelines were only developed to handle specific analyses such as genetic variant calling or population structure analyses. Other efforts aiming to bridge between lower-level manipulation of population sequencing data and higher-level applications of population genetic variants have resulted in the development of a pipeline platform. For example, the Pop-Gen Pipeline Platform (PPP) (<xref rid="msae040-B53" ref-type="bibr">Webb et al. 2021</xref>) has been implemented as a software platform to support several sets of scripts for VCF file processing, data manipulation, file format conversion, and five population genetic analyses. However, PPP only provides modulated functions that can be used as building blocks in constructing a whole pipeline, so the burden of running a series of scripts to conduct population genetic analyses remains. Moreover, population genetic variant data must be available before using the PPP.</p>
    <p>To address the above problems, in this study we present an automated pipeline called PAPipe for comprehensive population genetic analyses that use population NGS data as input. PAPipe consists of five main steps: read trimming, read mapping, genetic variant calling, data filtering and format converting, and analysis result generating. With only the population sequencing data and appropriate configuration of parameters, PAPipe enables automated result generation from nine population genetic analyses: PCA, phylogenetic analysis, population tree analysis, population structure analysis, linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay analysis, selective sweep analysis, population admixture analysis, sequentially Markovian coalescent analysis, and fixation index analysis. Moreover, to enhance user convenience, PAPipe provides default parameters for every step, and researchers can change these parameters using an easy-to-use web interface. When researchers have intermediate data, such as read alignment data or genetic variant call data in advance, they can use such data as intermediate input for further downstream analysis. PAPipe also provides a web interface for easily browsing analysis results.</p>
    <p>PAPipe is designed to generate results from extensive population genetic analyses to promote discussion and improve the utilization of population whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. Therefore, PAPipe is expected to be very useful for gaining in-depth insight for target populations. PAPipe is implemented for the Linux operating system, and Docker image files are provided to reduce the challenges associated with environment settings.

    <title>New Approaches</title>
    <p>The PAPipe was designed as a comprehensive pipeline with which to generate results of various population genetic analyses using raw WGS reads. The PAPipe features the seamless connection of five main steps: read trimming, read mapping, genetic variant calling, data filtering and format converting, and analysis result generating step. It can be run using a single command (<xref rid="msae040-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The analysis result generating step generates high-quality visualizations of the results of nine population genetic analyses: PCA, phylogenetic analysis, population tree analysis, population structure analysis, LD decay analysis, selective sweep analysis, population admixture analysis, sequentially Markovian coalescent analysis, and fixation index analysis. Therefore, PAPipe allows researchers to easily perform the above nine population genetic analyses all at once. In addition to this high-level automation of analyses, PAPipe is flexible and can be customized by users. For example, users can easily (i) skip some steps in PAPipe if they want to use pregenerated data, (ii) choose analysis programs in the read mapping and genetic variant calling steps, (iii) perform some subset of the nine population genetic analyses in the analysis result generating step if they so desire, (iv) change the parameters of all analysis tools included in PAPipe using an easy-to-use web interface, and (v) browse the analysis results using another easy-to-use web interface. The Materials and Methods section provides further details of each step in PAPipe.</p>

      <title>Clustering of Cattle Populations Based on Genetic Signatures</title>
      <p>PAPipe can calculate principal components (PCs) and their proportion of variance explained (PVE) using identified SNPs in the PCA step. For top PCs whose sum of PVEs is greater than 80%, PCA plots for all pairs of PCs are then generated. We used PAPipe to cluster these five cattle populations based on the genetic signatures represented by the identified SNPs. In this analysis, the top 14 PCs were selected and 91 PCA plots were created (<xref rid="msae040-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a and b</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material</xref> online). Based on the PCA plot between PC1 and PC2 (<xref rid="msae040-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), all five cattle breeds could clearly be separated from each other, with Holstein and Simmental being relatively close to each other, consistent with observation in a previous study (<xref rid="msae040-B26" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2016</xref>). Hanwoo was the most distinct population in terms of PC1. Additional characteristics can be discovered by observing other PCA plots. For example, Angus and Jersey were placed very closely in the PCA plot between PC1 and PC4 (<xref rid="msae040-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). This may indicate that Angus and Jersey share some genetic features. As shown above, the identified PCs and multiple PCA plots automatically produced by PAPipe can help researchers to find interesting clustering patterns from multiple angles through different PCs.</p>

As shown in <xref rid="msae040-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, most individuals from the same cattle breed were grouped together. Specifically, the Angus, Holstein, and Simmental populations were placed closer to each other than the other two populations, which is consistent with the PCA plot shown in <xref rid="msae040-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>.

      <title>Inferring the Ancestry of Cattle Populations based on Population Structure</title>
      <p>PAPipe can analyze the structure of given populations and draw population structure plots using different K values (which range from 2 to 5 by default) and SNPs in the population structure analysis step. Researchers can easily trace the ancestry of populations by comparing multiple plots generated by PAPipe with different K values together. The structures of the cattle populations were examined by PAPipe, and the generated plots with K values ranging from 2 to 5 were compared (<xref rid="msae040-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). When K = 2, Jersey was clearly distinguished from the other four populations. Holstein and Simmental remained highly similar to each other with the K values ranging from 2 to 4, which is consistent with the results shown in <xref rid="msae040-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a to c</xref>. Angus (with K values ranging from 3 to 5) and Hanwoo (with K values ranging from 4 to 5) were found to have relatively isolated ancestries, which is similar to the results of a previous study (<xref rid="msae040-B26" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2016</xref>).</p>

      <title>Identifying the Mode of Admixture Among Cattle Populations</title>

Using PAPipe, those population admixture statistics were calculated and compared for all possible combinations of the five cattle populations (<xref rid="msae040-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary tables S2 to S5, Supplementary Material</xref> online).

Using this function of PAPipe, the trajectory of the effective population size of each cattle population was predicted and compared by the PSMC analysis (<xref rid="msae040-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). At around a million years ago, the effective population sizes of all cattle populations were highly similar to each other. However, after that time point, there were increases in both the effective population sizes of all cattle populations and their variances. The effective population sizes of Simmental and Hanwoo showed the most dramatic changes. This pattern was observed by around one hundred thousand years ago. An overall decrease in the effective population size was then followed for all cattle populations.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>We developed PAPipe, a pipeline enabling comprehensive population genetic analysis. PAPipe automates a series of steps, including read trimming, read mapping, genetic variant calling, data filtering and format converting, and analysis result generating via nine population genetic analyses, such as PCA, phylogenetic analysis, population tree analysis, population structure analysis, LD decay analysis, selective sweep analysis, population admixture analysis, sequentially Markovian coalescent analysis, and fixation index analysis. The utility of PAPipe was demonstrated with a public dataset of cattle, and analysis results and publication-level figures were successfully generated.</p>
    <p>PAPipe allows researchers to focus on analyzing the results, rather than having to spend large amounts of time executing individual programs, by automating the running of interconnected analysis programs. Despite the convenience of automated and default settings in PAPipe, some default parameters are not appropriate for specific analyses. Because of this, PAPipe is designed to allow researchers to easily modify specific parameters and browse the analysis results using an easy-to-use web interface. The current version of PAPipe only contains nine population genetic analyses. However, PAPipe will be continuously revised to include updated versions of existing tools in PAPipe or new population genetic analysis tools to increase the utility of PAPipe in various types of population genetic studies.</p>

      <sec id="msae040-s4.1.1">
        <title>Read Trimming Step</title>
        <p>PAPipe checks the quality of input NGS reads and trims them if necessary. This step consists of three sub-steps: assessing the quality of raw reads, trimming raw reads, and accessing the quality of trimmed reads. The quality of reads was assessed by FastQC (v 0.11.9) (<xref rid="msae040-B2" ref-type="bibr">Andrews 2010</xref>), while the web page to be browsed for summary statistics was generated by MultiQC (v 1.9) (<xref rid="msae040-B19" ref-type="bibr">Ewels et al. 2016</xref>). Read trimming is processed by TrimGalore (v 0.6.0) (<xref rid="msae040-B24" ref-type="bibr">Krueger et al. 2019</xref>) which is a commonly used program for trimming sequencing data. This step is typically used to enhance the data accuracy and improve the efficiency of subsequent population analysis.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="msae040-s4.1.2">
        <title>Read Mapping Step</title>
        <p>To obtain a set of genetic variants, NGS reads need to be aligned to reference genome sequences. PAPipe was constructed to use one of the two mapping tools BWA (v 0.7.17-r1188) (<xref rid="msae040-B31" ref-type="bibr">Li and Durbin 2009</xref>) and Bowtie 2 (v 2.3.4.3) (<xref rid="msae040-B25" ref-type="bibr">Langmead and Salzberg 2012</xref>) that are widely chosen by users to perform this task. Read mapping of the data is then processed with the Picard Toolkit (v 2.17.11) (<xref rid="msae040-B6" ref-type="bibr">Broad Institute 2018</xref>) to identify duplicates with the “MarkDuplicates” module and process read groups with the “AddOrReplaceReadGroups” module. Users can easily modify the parameter file of PAPipe to change or add parameters for each process. The read mapping step can also be skipped if users have prepared their own read alignment data.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="msae040-s4.1.3">
        <title>Genetic Variant Calling Step</title>
        <p>Similar to the read mapping step, PAPipe was designed to use one of three pipelines based on three tools, Genome Analysis ToolKit 3 (GATK3 v 3.8-1) (<xref rid="msae040-B17" ref-type="bibr">DePristo et al. 2011</xref>), Genome Analysis ToolKit 4 (GATK4 v 4.1.7.0), and BCFtools (v 1.9) (<xref rid="msae040-B33" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 2009</xref>), which are often selected by users to call genetic variants from NGS read alignments.</p>
        <p>Two GATK-based pipelines were constructed based on the GATK Best Practices Workflow for Germline short variant discovery (<xref rid="msae040-B51" ref-type="bibr">Van der Auwera et al. 2013</xref>). However, the two GATK-based pipelines have different alignment preprocessing steps. In the case of the pipeline based on GATK3 (v 3.8-1), the following processes are performed sequentially to realign and recalibrate reads: Picard (v 2.17.11) “ReorderSam”, GATK “RealignerTargetCreator”, “IndelRealigner”, “BaseRecalibrator”, and “PrintReads”. Meanwhile, the pipeline based on GATK4 (v 4.1.7.0), only read recalibration was implemented with GATK “BaseRecalibrator” and “ApplyBQSR”.</p>
        <p>The genetic variant calling process shared by the two GATK-based pipelines is executed after the alignment preprocessing step. Specifically, “HaplotypeCaller” calls genetic variants per sample to generate single-sample GVCF files, while “CombineGVCFs” combines single-sample GVCF files into a single-merged GVCF file. Next, “GenotypeGVCFs” is used for joint genotyping and to generate the first genotype VCF file containing all SNPs and insertions and deletions (indels). “SelectVariants” is used to differentiate between SNPs and indels, thereby leaving only SNPs in the VCF file. In this process, the dbSNP parameter (–dbsnp) can be used to annotate SNPs with user-provided data from the dbSNP database. Finally, the two GATK-based pipelines were constructed to only extract SNPs that pass the hard filtering criteria: QD &lt; 2.0, QUAL &lt; 30.0, SOR &gt; 3.0, FS &gt; 60.0, MQ &lt; 40.0, MQRankSum &lt; −12.5, and ReadPosRankSum &lt; −8.0.</p>
        <p>The BCFtools-based pipeline was developed to directly process read alignment files without the need for additional preprocessing steps. SAMtools (v 1.9-36-gb6fea3c) “mpileup” is used to combine multiple files containing the alignments of a single sample into a single BCF file. The parameter “-g” is used to group nonvariant sites into gVCF blocks according to the minimum per-sample read depth during the “mpileup” process. The BCFtools (v 1.9) “call” function is then used to call SNPs and indels with parameters “-c and -v”. Finally, the “vcfutils.pl” varFilter” is used to discard indels and filter SNPs according to the following default filtering criteria: d = 2, D = 10000000, a = 2, W = 10, Q = 10, w = 3, 1 = 1e−4, 2 = 1e−100, 3 = 0, 4 = 1e−4, G = 0, S = 1000, and e = 1e−4. The VCFtool “–tstv-by-count” command is also executed to additionally calculate the Ti/Tv ratio.</p>
        <p>Similar to the read mapping step, users can change or add parameters for each process by modifying the parameter file of PAPipe. It is also possible for users to skip this genetic variant calling step if they prefer to use their own genetic variant data.</p>

        <title>Data Filtering and Format Converting Step</title>
        <p>Genetic variant analysis tools require their own input data format. PAPipe provides a data filtering and format converting step to overcome this potential issue and thus facilitate the seamless execution of nine population genetic analysis tools. PLINK (v 1.9) (<xref rid="msae040-B44" ref-type="bibr">Purcell et al. 2007</xref>), VCFtools (v 0.1.17) (<xref rid="msae040-B13" ref-type="bibr">Danecek et al. 2011</xref>), and an in-house Perl script are used to execute three different treatments. PLINK is used to filter SNPs and convert the file format to the plink binary format (BED) using the following default parameters: –geno 0.01, –maf 0.05, –hwe 0.000001, –make-bed. VCFtools (v 0.1.17) is used to convert the file format of genetic variants to the plink format (PED). PAPipe also provides an in-house Perl script to convert the file format of genetic variants to HapMap format (HAPMAP). As in the previous steps, parameters can be changed or added by modifying the PAPipe parameter file.</p>

      <sec id="msae040-s4.1.5">
        <title>Analysis Result Generating Step</title>
        <p>By using data generated from the previous steps as input, PAPipe can run several tools for the following nine population genetic analyses: PCA, phylogenetic analysis, population tree analysis, population structure analysis, LD decay analysis, selective sweep analysis, population admixture analysis, sequentially Markovian coalescent analysis, and fixation index analysis. All nine analyses can be run with default parameters provided by PAPipe. It is also possible to only run some subset of the tools, if so desired by the user. Details of the supported analyses run by PAPipe are explained in the following.</p>
        <sec id="msae040-s4.1.5.1">
          <title>Principal Component Analysis</title>
          <p>PCA is a basic analysis for examining population structure by identifying a relationship between different populations. It is implemented in two steps: (i) identifying PCs using the population genetic variant dataset and (ii) drawing 2D plots for two different PCs. Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (v 1.26.0) (<xref rid="msae040-B54" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al. 2011</xref>) or PLINK (v 2.00a5) (<xref rid="msae040-B9" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al. 2015</xref>) can be used to perform the PCA analysis, while an in-house R script is used for visualization. Our PCA analysis pipeline generates multiple 2D plots comprising all possible pairs of two different PCs whose sum of variance exceeds some given percentage (where the default value is set at 80%). Users can also limit the number of generated plots using the “maxPC” parameter.</p>

        <sec id="msae040-s4.1.5.2">
          <title>Phylogenetic Analysis</title>
          <p>A phylogenetic tree can be used to infer the evolutionary history of populations using the genetic variant dataset. SNPhylo (v 20180901) (<xref rid="msae040-B27" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2014</xref>) is used to generate a phylogenetic tree from genetic variant data in the HapMap format. The constructed trees are presented as a text file in Newick (NWK) format, alongside figures of unrooted tree.</p>

          <p>Treemix (v 1.13) (<xref rid="msae040-B43" ref-type="bibr">Pickrell and Pritchard 2012</xref>) was integrated into PAPipe to infer historical relationships among populations based on genetic admixtures. Treemix requires proper variant filtration and LD pruning as an initial step for generating input data. The variant filtration is performed using VCFtools (v 0.1.17) with the “-max-missing 1” parameter by default, while the LD pruning is executed using the script provided by Treemix (v 1.13) with the “ldPruning 0.1” parameter by default. Subsequently, Treemix (v 1.13) is executed with the default parameters, aside from “-k 500” meaning 500 SNPs per block and multiple values of the “-m” parameter representing the number of migration events used in estimating the tree. The default value of the “-m” parameter is 0, but PAPipe enables repeated execution of Treemix using a range of “-m” values from 0 to a user-provided value.</p>

        <sec id="msae040-s4.1.5.4">
          <title>Population Structure Analysis</title>
          <p>The population structure can be analyzed by estimating the proportion of ancestral origins in the individual admixture. In PAPipe, ADMIXTURE (v 1.3.0) (<xref rid="msae040-B1" ref-type="bibr">Alexander et al. 2009</xref>) is used to estimate individual ancestry, while CLUMPAK (v 1.1) (<xref rid="msae040-B23" ref-type="bibr">Kopelman et al. 2015</xref>) is used to visualize the results. Parameter K, which is the number of inferred ancestral species for clustering, is required to run ADMIXTURE. Users typically perform this analysis multiple times with different K values and then use the most reliable result. Therefore, PAPipe accepts a single parameter value k (5 for default) for K and automatically performs this analysis k − 1 times using 2 through k as the K value. This generates k − 1 admixture plots for different K values.</p>

        <sec id="msae040-s4.1.5.5">
          <title>LD Decay Analysis</title>
          <p>LD is a nonrandom association of alleles at two or more different loci. Various factors can affect LD, including the recombination rate, population structure, and number of generations. Therefore, a decay of LD represents a history of population recombination. In this analysis, PopLDdecay (v 3.31) (<xref rid="msae040-B55" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. 2019</xref>) is used to calculate a pairwise measure of LD ( <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM11" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>). Given a maximum distance as a parameter value, PopLDdecay calculates <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM12" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> values from all available pairs of SNPs located within the maximum distance. Next, SNP pairs with the same distance are collected and their average <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM13" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> value is calculated.

PAPipe runs PopLDdecay several times using different maximum distances (500 Kbp, 1 Mbp, 5 Mbp, and 10 Mbp by default).</p>

          <title>Sequentially Markovian Coalescent Analysis</title>
          <p>One of the ultimate objectives of population genetic analysis is to elucidate the evolutional history of populations by identifying the relationship among populations (<xref rid="msae040-B34" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Hansen 2017</xref>). To this end, effective population size has been used to track the demographic history of populations chronologically. PAPipe utilizes PSMC (v 0.6.5) (<xref rid="msae040-B32" ref-type="bibr">Li and Durbin 2011</xref>) analysis and MSMC (v 2.0.0) (<xref rid="msae040-B47" ref-type="bibr">Schiffels and Durbin 2014</xref>) analysis to estimate the effective population size of a specific population and determine whether it underwent expansion or contraction during its evolution.</p>
          <p>PSMC analysis, which involves inferring the effective population size from a single diploid genome, has in the past been widely used to estimate demographic history from individual genomes. However, the MSMC analysis, which can simultaneously utilize multiple individuals, has emerged as an effective alternative approach.</p>
          <p>The PSMC analysis in PAPipe was implemented in three steps: (i) processing input data, (ii) generating PSMC results, and (iii) visualization. In the first step, read alignment files are merged and processed to create a single alignment file in the PSMCFA format by SAMtools (v 1.9-36-gb6fea3c) mpileup with the “-C 50” parameter, vcfutils vcf2fq with the “-d 10” parameter, and BCFtools (v 1.9) view with the “-D 100” parameter. After the input data are prepared, PSMC (v 0.6.5) is run with the default parameters. Subsequently, plots are generated using the script obtained from PSMC.</p>
          <p>In the case of the MSMC analysis, read alignment files are prepared in the MSMCFA format by SAMtools (v 1.9-36-gb6fea3c) mpileup with the “-C 50” parameter, BCFtools (v 1.9) call with the “-c and -V indel” parameter, and bamCaller.py in MSMC. Then, MSMC (v 2.0.0) is executed with the default parameters, and the final plots are generated using an in-house visualization script.</p>

Users can also change target populations by modifying the population group parameter. For example, if two out of four populations are set as target populations in the parameter, PAPipe only executes the analysis once to calculates <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM27" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> values by comparing the target populations against the remaining ones.

      <title>Usability and Accessibility of PAPipe</title>
      <p>PAPipe has been designed with a focus on user-friendliness, and it incorporates several features with the intention of to enhancing usability. (i) A web page for setting program parameters: PAPipe provides researchers with a web page (<ext-link xlink:href="http://bioinfo.konkuk.ac.kr/PAPipe/parameter_builder/" ext-link-type="uri">http://bioinfo.konkuk.ac.kr/PAPipe/parameter_builder/</ext-link>) on which they can set various program parameters within a visual web interface, which then automatically generates the desired parameter file. (ii) A web page for browsing pipeline output: PAPipe provides a web page summarizing all generated output from all population analyses. (iii) A small test dataset for easily understanding the pipeline: PAPipe provides a small test dataset and parameter file, thus helping researchers understand how to best prepare the input data and parameter files. (iv) Increased parallelization level of the pipeline: the whole pipeline of PAPipe has been optimized for performance by automatically conducting fork management for all feasible components, with the ultimate aim of enhancing execution speed. The running time and disk usage of each part in PAPipe as a function of the number of threads were measured using the test dataset (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary table S6, Supplementary Material</xref> online).

      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have led to a substantial increase in the availability of population genetic variant data, thus prompting the development of various population analysis tools to enhance our understanding of population structure and evolution. The tools that are currently used to analyze population genetic variant data generally require different environments, parameters, and formats of the input data, which can act as a barrier preventing the wide-spread usage of such tools by general researchers who may not be familiar with bioinformatics. To address this problem, we have developed an automated and comprehensive pipeline called PAPipe to perform nine widely used population genetic analyses using population NGS data. PAPipe seamlessly interconnects and serializes multiple steps, such as read trimming and mapping, genetic variant calling, data filtering, and format converting, along with nine population genetic analyses such as principal component analysis, phylogenetic analysis, population tree analysis, population structure analysis, linkage disequilibrium decay analysis, selective sweep analysis, population admixture analysis, sequentially Markovian coalescent analysis, and fixation index analysis. PAPipe also provides an easy-to-use web interface that allows for the parameters to be set and the analysis results to be browsed in intuitive manner. PAPipe can be used to generate extensive results that provide insights that can help enhance user convenience and data usability.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Population genetics is the study of genetic similarities and differences within and between populations (<xref rid="msae040-B36" ref-type="bibr">Nei 1975</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B8" ref-type="bibr">Casillas and Barbadilla 2017</xref>). The discovery of genetic variations represented by population allele frequencies as well as comparisons of population profiles of genetic variations from different perspectives both play important roles in this field of study. Based on the theory of modern synthesis, which integrates Darwinian evolution and Mendelian genetics, the concept of evolution can be defined by changes in allele frequency (<xref rid="msae040-B14" ref-type="bibr">Dannemann et al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B21" ref-type="bibr">Franchini et al. 2020</xref>). Accordingly, population genetic variant data can be used to make inferences regarding evolution within populations by estimating genetic structure, phylogenetic relationships, and effective population size (<xref rid="msae040-B37" ref-type="bibr">Nishiyama et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B21" ref-type="bibr">Franchini et al. 2020</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B30" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2020b</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B46" ref-type="bibr">Reimer et al. 2020</xref>). Inference and estimation of population structure and characteristics can be used in various studies, such as population immunity studies (<xref rid="msae040-B15" ref-type="bibr">Daub et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B3" ref-type="bibr">Barreiro and Quintana-Murci 2020</xref>), etiology studies (<xref rid="msae040-B18" ref-type="bibr">Di Rienzo 2006</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B48" ref-type="bibr">Torkamani et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B40" ref-type="bibr">Parkes et al. 2013</xref>), studies on population-specific diseases (<xref rid="msae040-B5" ref-type="bibr">Bhatia et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B56" ref-type="bibr">Zhong et al. 2020</xref>), studies investigating domesticated animals (<xref rid="msae040-B39" ref-type="bibr">Parker et al. 2017</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B10" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2018</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B20" ref-type="bibr">Fitak et al. 2020</xref>), and population migration studies (<xref rid="msae040-B11" ref-type="bibr">Choudhury et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B39" ref-type="bibr">Parker et al. 2017</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B7" ref-type="bibr">Browning et al. 2018</xref>).</p>
    <p>Developments in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have made it easy and cost-effective to generate vast amounts of high-quality, individual genome sequencing data. Moreover, continued advancement in NGS technologies have resulted in the accumulation of population sequencing data. Therefore, various tools have been developed for applications in population genetic analyses. Because population genetics is based on genetic similarities and differences within and between populations, population genetic analyses generally begin by examining population genetic variant data (<xref rid="msae040-B33" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B51" ref-type="bibr">Van der Auwera et al. 2013</xref>), which represent fundamental inputs in various downstream analyses, such as phylogenetic tree inference, principal component analysis (PCA), and population structure analysis. In many studies, different types of population genetic analyses have been combined in attempts to comprehensively understand the target populations and draw meaningful conclusions (<xref rid="msae040-B4" ref-type="bibr">Baumsteiger et al. 2017</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B29" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2017</xref>, <xref rid="msae040-B28" ref-type="bibr">2020a</xref>).</p>
    <p>However, calling population genetic variants from population sequencing data is a complex task, because it requires multiple tools to be run, with each tool requiring a specific running environment and several preprocessing steps to appropriately prepare the input data. Further, after obtaining the population genetic variant data, differential formatting of the genetic variant data is needed for different population genetic analysis tools, which also requires specific running environment and particular parameter settings. These limitations pose challenges for researchers who are not familiar with bioinformatics.</p>
    <p>To address these challenges, recent efforts have generated simple pipelines by combining multiple tasks. For example, a number of studies have developed several different genetic variant-calling pipelines (<xref rid="msae040-B52" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B38" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="msae040-B22" ref-type="bibr">Ip et al. 2020</xref>) by combining multiple steps in genetic variant calling such that they are executed by a single command. Another pipeline-building study for population structure analysis (<xref rid="msae040-B35" ref-type="bibr">Mussmann et al. 2020</xref>) has developed ADMIXPIPE. This combines multiple tasks such as the filtering of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), running the ADMIXTURE program (<xref rid="msae040-B1" ref-type="bibr">Alexander et al. 2009</xref>), and visualizing population structures with the CLUMPAK program (<xref rid="msae040-B23" ref-type="bibr">Kopelman et al. 2015</xref>) to facilitate population structure analysis. Unfortunately, those pipelines were only developed to handle specific analyses such as genetic variant calling or population structure analyses. Other efforts aiming to bridge between lower-level manipulation of population sequencing data and higher-level applications of population genetic variants have resulted in the development of a pipeline platform. For example, the Pop-Gen Pipeline Platform (PPP) (<xref rid="msae040-B53" ref-type="bibr">Webb et al. 2021</xref>) has been implemented as a software platform to support several sets of scripts for VCF file processing, data manipulation, file format conversion, and five population genetic analyses. However, PPP only provides modulated functions that can be used as building blocks in constructing a whole pipeline, so the burden of running a series of scripts to conduct population genetic analyses remains. Moreover, population genetic variant data must be available before using the PPP.</p>
    <p>To address the above problems, in this study we present an automated pipeline called PAPipe for comprehensive population genetic analyses that use population NGS data as input. PAPipe consists of five main steps: read trimming, read mapping, genetic variant calling, data filtering and format converting, and analysis result generating. With only the population sequencing data and appropriate configuration of parameters, PAPipe enables automated result generation from nine population genetic analyses: PCA, phylogenetic analysis, population tree analysis, population structure analysis, linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay analysis, selective sweep analysis, population admixture analysis, sequentially Markovian coalescent analysis, and fixation index analysis. Moreover, to enhance user convenience, PAPipe provides default parameters for every step, and researchers can change these parameters using an easy-to-use web interface. When researchers have intermediate data, such as read alignment data or genetic variant call data in advance, they can use such data as intermediate input for further downstream analysis. PAPipe also provides a web interface for easily browsing analysis results.</p>
    <p>PAPipe is designed to generate results from extensive population genetic analyses to promote discussion and improve the utilization of population whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. Therefore, PAPipe is expected to be very useful for gaining in-depth insight for target populations. PAPipe is implemented for the Linux operating system, and Docker image files are provided to reduce the challenges associated with environment settings.

    <title>New Approaches</title>
    <p>The PAPipe was designed as a comprehensive pipeline with which to generate results of various population genetic analyses using raw WGS reads. The PAPipe features the seamless connection of five main steps: read trimming, read mapping, genetic variant calling, data filtering and format converting, and analysis result generating step. It can be run using a single command (<xref rid="msae040-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The analysis result generating step generates high-quality visualizations of the results of nine population genetic analyses: PCA, phylogenetic analysis, population tree analysis, population structure analysis, LD decay analysis, selective sweep analysis, population admixture analysis, sequentially Markovian coalescent analysis, and fixation index analysis. Therefore, PAPipe allows researchers to easily perform the above nine population genetic analyses all at once. In addition to this high-level automation of analyses, PAPipe is flexible and can be customized by users. For example, users can easily (i) skip some steps in PAPipe if they want to use pregenerated data, (ii) choose analysis programs in the read mapping and genetic variant calling steps, (iii) perform some subset of the nine population genetic analyses in the analysis result generating step if they so desire, (iv) change the parameters of all analysis tools included in PAPipe using an easy-to-use web interface, and (v) browse the analysis results using another easy-to-use web interface. The Materials and Methods section provides further details of each step in PAPipe.</p>

      <title>Clustering of Cattle Populations Based on Genetic Signatures</title>
      <p>PAPipe can calculate principal components (PCs) and their proportion of variance explained (PVE) using identified SNPs in the PCA step. For top PCs whose sum of PVEs is greater than 80%, PCA plots for all pairs of PCs are then generated. We used PAPipe to cluster these five cattle populations based on the genetic signatures represented by the identified SNPs. In this analysis, the top 14 PCs were selected and 91 PCA plots were created (<xref rid="msae040-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a and b</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material</xref> online). Based on the PCA plot between PC1 and PC2 (<xref rid="msae040-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), all five cattle breeds could clearly be separated from each other, with Holstein and Simmental being relatively close to each other, consistent with observation in a previous study (<xref rid="msae040-B26" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2016</xref>). Hanwoo was the most distinct population in terms of PC1. Additional characteristics can be discovered by observing other PCA plots. For example, Angus and Jersey were placed very closely in the PCA plot between PC1 and PC4 (<xref rid="msae040-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). This may indicate that Angus and Jersey share some genetic features. As shown above, the identified PCs and multiple PCA plots automatically produced by PAPipe can help researchers to find interesting clustering patterns from multiple angles through different PCs.</p>

      <p>PAPipe can analyze the structure of given populations and draw population structure plots using different K values (which range from 2 to 5 by default) and SNPs in the population structure analysis step. Researchers can easily trace the ancestry of populations by comparing multiple plots generated by PAPipe with different K values together. The structures of the cattle populations were examined by PAPipe, and the generated plots with K values ranging from 2 to 5 were compared (<xref rid="msae040-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). When K = 2, Jersey was clearly distinguished from the other four populations. Holstein and Simmental remained highly similar to each other with the K values ranging from 2 to 4, which is consistent with the results shown in <xref rid="msae040-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a to c</xref>. Angus (with K values ranging from 3 to 5) and Hanwoo (with K values ranging from 4 to 5) were found to have relatively isolated ancestries, which is similar to the results of a previous study (<xref rid="msae040-B26" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2016</xref>).</p>

Using this function of PAPipe, the trajectory of the effective population size of each cattle population was predicted and compared by the PSMC analysis (<xref rid="msae040-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). At around a million years ago, the effective population sizes of all cattle populations were highly similar to each other. However, after that time point, there were increases in both the effective population sizes of all cattle populations and their variances. The effective population sizes of Simmental and Hanwoo showed the most dramatic changes. This pattern was observed by around one hundred thousand years ago.

The utility of PAPipe was demonstrated with a public dataset of cattle, and analysis results and publication-level figures were successfully generated.</p>
    <p>PAPipe allows researchers to focus on analyzing the results, rather than having to spend large amounts of time executing individual programs, by automating the running of interconnected analysis programs. Despite the convenience of automated and default settings in PAPipe, some default parameters are not appropriate for specific analyses. Because of this, PAPipe is designed to allow researchers to easily modify specific parameters and browse the analysis results using an easy-to-use web interface. The current version of PAPipe only contains nine population genetic analyses. However, PAPipe will be continuously revised to include updated versions of existing tools in PAPipe or new population genetic analysis tools to increase the utility of PAPipe in various types of population genetic studies.</p>

      <title>Details of Each Step in PAPipe</title>
      <sec id="msae040-s4.1.1">
        <title>Read Trimming Step</title>
        <p>PAPipe checks the quality of input NGS reads and trims them if necessary. This step consists of three sub-steps: assessing the quality of raw reads, trimming raw reads, and accessing the quality of trimmed reads. The quality of reads was assessed by FastQC (v 0.11.9) (<xref rid="msae040-B2" ref-type="bibr">Andrews 2010</xref>), while the web page to be browsed for summary statistics was generated by MultiQC (v 1.9) (<xref rid="msae040-B19" ref-type="bibr">Ewels et al. 2016</xref>). Read trimming is processed by TrimGalore (v 0.6.0) (<xref rid="msae040-B24" ref-type="bibr">Krueger et al. 2019</xref>) which is a commonly used program for trimming sequencing data. This step is typically used to enhance the data accuracy and improve the efficiency of subsequent population analysis.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="msae040-s4.1.2">
        <title>Read Mapping Step</title>
        <p>To obtain a set of genetic variants, NGS reads need to be aligned to reference genome sequences. PAPipe was constructed to use one of the two mapping tools BWA (v 0.7.17-r1188) (<xref rid="msae040-B31" ref-type="bibr">Li and Durbin 2009</xref>) and Bowtie 2 (v 2.3.4.3) (<xref rid="msae040-B25" ref-type="bibr">Langmead and Salzberg 2012</xref>) that are widely chosen by users to perform this task. Read mapping of the data is then processed with the Picard Toolkit (v 2.17.11) (<xref rid="msae040-B6" ref-type="bibr">Broad Institute 2018</xref>) to identify duplicates with the “MarkDuplicates” module and process read groups with the “AddOrReplaceReadGroups” module. Users can easily modify the parameter file of PAPipe to change or add parameters for each process. The read mapping step can also be skipped if users have prepared their own read alignment data.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="msae040-s4.1.3">
        <title>Genetic Variant Calling Step</title>
        <p>Similar to the read mapping step, PAPipe was designed to use one of three pipelines based on three tools, Genome Analysis ToolKit 3 (GATK3 v 3.8-1) (<xref rid="msae040-B17" ref-type="bibr">DePristo et al. 2011</xref>), Genome Analysis ToolKit 4 (GATK4 v 4.1.7.0), and BCFtools (v 1.9) (<xref rid="msae040-B33" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 2009</xref>), which are often selected by users to call genetic variants from NGS read alignments.</p>
        <p>Two GATK-based pipelines were constructed based on the GATK Best Practices Workflow for Germline short variant discovery (<xref rid="msae040-B51" ref-type="bibr">Van der Auwera et al. 2013</xref>). However, the two GATK-based pipelines have different alignment preprocessing steps. In the case of the pipeline based on GATK3 (v 3.8-1), the following processes are performed sequentially to realign and recalibrate reads: Picard (v 2.17.11) “ReorderSam”, GATK “RealignerTargetCreator”, “IndelRealigner”, “BaseRecalibrator”, and “PrintReads”. Meanwhile, the pipeline based on GATK4 (v 4.1.7.0), only read recalibration was implemented with GATK “BaseRecalibrator” and “ApplyBQSR”.</p>
        <p>The genetic variant calling process shared by the two GATK-based pipelines is executed after the alignment preprocessing step. Specifically, “HaplotypeCaller” calls genetic variants per sample to generate single-sample GVCF files, while “CombineGVCFs” combines single-sample GVCF files into a single-merged GVCF file. Next, “GenotypeGVCFs” is used for joint genotyping and to generate the first genotype VCF file containing all SNPs and insertions and deletions (indels). “SelectVariants” is used to differentiate between SNPs and indels, thereby leaving only SNPs in the VCF file. In this process, the dbSNP parameter (–dbsnp) can be used to annotate SNPs with user-provided data from the dbSNP database. Finally, the two GATK-based pipelines were constructed to only extract SNPs that pass the hard filtering criteria: QD &lt; 2.0, QUAL &lt; 30.0, SOR &gt; 3.0, FS &gt; 60.0, MQ &lt; 40.0, MQRankSum &lt; −12.5, and ReadPosRankSum &lt; −8.0.</p>
        <p>The BCFtools-based pipeline was developed to directly process read alignment files without the need for additional preprocessing steps. SAMtools (v 1.9-36-gb6fea3c) “mpileup” is used to combine multiple files containing the alignments of a single sample into a single BCF file. The parameter “-g” is used to group nonvariant sites into gVCF blocks according to the minimum per-sample read depth during the “mpileup” process. The BCFtools (v 1.9) “call” function is then used to call SNPs and indels with parameters “-c and -v”. Finally, the “vcfutils.pl” varFilter” is used to discard indels and filter SNPs according to the following default filtering criteria: d = 2, D = 10000000, a = 2, W = 10, Q = 10, w = 3, 1 = 1e−4, 2 = 1e−100, 3 = 0, 4 = 1e−4, G = 0, S = 1000, and e = 1e−4. The VCFtool “–tstv-by-count” command is also executed to additionally calculate the Ti/Tv ratio.</p>
        <p>Similar to the read mapping step, users can change or add parameters for each process by modifying the parameter file of PAPipe. It is also possible for users to skip this genetic variant calling step if they prefer to use their own genetic variant data.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="msae040-s4.1.4">
        <title>Data Filtering and Format Converting Step</title>
        <p>Genetic variant analysis tools require their own input data format. PAPipe provides a data filtering and format converting step to overcome this potential issue and thus facilitate the seamless execution of nine population genetic analysis tools. PLINK (v 1.9) (<xref rid="msae040-B44" ref-type="bibr">Purcell et al. 2007</xref>), VCFtools (v 0.1.17) (<xref rid="msae040-B13" ref-type="bibr">Danecek et al. 2011</xref>), and an in-house Perl script are used to execute three different treatments. PLINK is used to filter SNPs and convert the file format to the plink binary format (BED) using the following default parameters: –geno 0.01, –maf 0.05, –hwe 0.000001, –make-bed. VCFtools (v 0.1.17) is used to convert the file format of genetic variants to the plink format (PED). PAPipe also provides an in-house Perl script to convert the file format of genetic variants to HapMap format (HAPMAP). As in the previous steps, parameters can be changed or added by modifying the PAPipe parameter file.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="msae040-s4.1.5">
        <title>Analysis Result Generating Step</title>
        <p>By using data generated from the previous steps as input, PAPipe can run several tools for the following nine population genetic analyses: PCA, phylogenetic analysis, population tree analysis, population structure analysis, LD decay analysis, selective sweep analysis, population admixture analysis, sequentially Markovian coalescent analysis, and fixation index analysis. All nine analyses can be run with default parameters provided by PAPipe. It is also possible to only run some subset of the tools, if so desired by the user. Details of the supported analyses run by PAPipe are explained in the following.</p>
        <sec id="msae040-s4.1.5.1">
          <title>Principal Component Analysis</title>
          <p>PCA is a basic analysis for examining population structure by identifying a relationship between different populations. It is implemented in two steps: (i) identifying PCs using the population genetic variant dataset and (ii) drawing 2D plots for two different PCs. Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (v 1.26.0) (<xref rid="msae040-B54" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al. 2011</xref>) or PLINK (v 2.00a5) (<xref rid="msae040-B9" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al. 2015</xref>) can be used to perform the PCA analysis, while an in-house R script is used for visualization. Our PCA analysis pipeline generates multiple 2D plots comprising all possible pairs of two different PCs whose sum of variance exceeds some given percentage (where the default value is set at 80%). Users can also limit the number of generated plots using the “maxPC” parameter.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="msae040-s4.1.5.2">
          <title>Phylogenetic Analysis</title>
          <p>A phylogenetic tree can be used to infer the evolutionary history of populations using the genetic variant dataset. SNPhylo (v 20180901) (<xref rid="msae040-B27" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2014</xref>) is used to generate a phylogenetic tree from genetic variant data in the HapMap format. The constructed trees are presented as a text file in Newick (NWK) format, alongside figures of unrooted tree.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="msae040-s4.1.5.3">
          <title>Population Tree Analysis</title>
          <p>Treemix (v 1.13) (<xref rid="msae040-B43" ref-type="bibr">Pickrell and Pritchard 2012</xref>) was integrated into PAPipe to infer historical relationships among populations based on genetic admixtures. Treemix requires proper variant filtration and LD pruning as an initial step for generating input data. The variant filtration is performed using VCFtools (v 0.1.17) with the “-max-missing 1” parameter by default, while the LD pruning is executed using the script provided by Treemix (v 1.13) with the “ldPruning 0.1” parameter by default. Subsequently, Treemix (v 1.13) is executed with the default parameters, aside from “-k 500” meaning 500 SNPs per block and multiple values of the “-m” parameter representing the number of migration events used in estimating the tree. The default value of the “-m” parameter is 0, but PAPipe enables repeated execution of Treemix using a range of “-m” values from 0 to a user-provided value.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="msae040-s4.1.5.4">
          <title>Population Structure Analysis</title>
          <p>The population structure can be analyzed by estimating the proportion of ancestral origins in the individual admixture. In PAPipe, ADMIXTURE (v 1.3.0) (<xref rid="msae040-B1" ref-type="bibr">Alexander et al. 2009</xref>) is used to estimate individual ancestry, while CLUMPAK (v 1.1) (<xref rid="msae040-B23" ref-type="bibr">Kopelman et al. 2015</xref>) is used to visualize the results. Parameter K, which is the number of inferred ancestral species for clustering, is required to run ADMIXTURE. Users typically perform this analysis multiple times with different K values and then use the most reliable result. Therefore, PAPipe accepts a single parameter value k (5 for default) for K and automatically performs this analysis k − 1 times using 2 through k as the K value. This generates k − 1 admixture plots for different K values.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="msae040-s4.1.5.5">
          <title>LD Decay Analysis</title>
          <p>LD is a nonrandom association of alleles at two or more different loci. Various factors can affect LD, including the recombination rate, population structure, and number of generations. Therefore, a decay of LD represents a history of population recombination. In this analysis, PopLDdecay (v 3.31) (<xref rid="msae040-B55" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. 2019</xref>) is used to calculate a pairwise measure of LD ( <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM11" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>). Given a maximum distance as a parameter value, PopLDdecay calculates <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM12" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> values from all available pairs of SNPs located within the maximum distance. Next, SNP pairs with the same distance are collected and their average <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM13" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> value is calculated. Finally, the average <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM14" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> values are plotted as a function of the distance between SNPs using the script provided by PopLDdecay. PAPipe runs PopLDdecay several times using different maximum distances (500 Kbp, 1 Mbp, 5 Mbp, and 10 Mbp by default).</p>

          <title>Selective Sweep Analysis</title>
          <p>SweepFinder2 (v 1.0) (<xref rid="msae040-B16" ref-type="bibr">DeGiorgio et al. 2016</xref>) is used to detect selective sweeps. The input data used for SweepFinder2 is generated by population variant extraction and polarization of a variant file. Variants are extracted per each population by PLINK (v 1.9), and the polarization was done using the “polarizeVCFbyOutgroup” script (<xref rid="msae040-B50" ref-type="bibr">Ullrich 2021</xref>). SweepFinder2 is run with the default grid size parameter set to “-sg 1000”.</p>

          <title>Population Admixture Analysis</title>
          <p>PAPipe contains AdmixTools (v 7.0) (<xref rid="msae040-B42" ref-type="bibr">Patterson et al. 2012</xref>) to calculate <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM15" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM16" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, differential <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM17" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, and <italic toggle="yes">D</italic> statistics. Given three sets of populations A, B, and C, the <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM18" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> statistic is the product of allele frequency variations between population C and the other populations, A and B. The <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM19" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> statistic can be used to test whether population C is derived from the admixture of the other two populations. Given four sets of populations A, B, C, and D, the <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM20" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> statistic is the product of the allele frequency variations between two populations A and B and the corresponding variations between two populations C and D. The difference in two <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM21" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> values is tested for statistical significance by a Z-test, which is often used to compare the admixture of different combination of populations. The <italic toggle="yes">D</italic> statistic is estimated using a parsimonious method to detect gene flow among populations. PAPipe is implemented to calculate the above statistics from all possible combinations of populations, which obviates the need to configure subsets of populations.</p>

          <title>Sequentially Markovian Coalescent Analysis</title>
          <p>One of the ultimate objectives of population genetic analysis is to elucidate the evolutional history of populations by identifying the relationship among populations (<xref rid="msae040-B34" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Hansen 2017</xref>). To this end, effective population size has been used to track the demographic history of populations chronologically. PAPipe utilizes PSMC (v 0.6.5) (<xref rid="msae040-B32" ref-type="bibr">Li and Durbin 2011</xref>) analysis and MSMC (v 2.0.0) (<xref rid="msae040-B47" ref-type="bibr">Schiffels and Durbin 2014</xref>) analysis to estimate the effective population size of a specific population and determine whether it underwent expansion or contraction during its evolution.</p>
          <p>PSMC analysis, which involves inferring the effective population size from a single diploid genome, has in the past been widely used to estimate demographic history from individual genomes. However, the MSMC analysis, which can simultaneously utilize multiple individuals, has emerged as an effective alternative approach.</p>
          <p>The PSMC analysis in PAPipe was implemented in three steps: (i) processing input data, (ii) generating PSMC results, and (iii) visualization. In the first step, read alignment files are merged and processed to create a single alignment file in the PSMCFA format by SAMtools (v 1.9-36-gb6fea3c) mpileup with the “-C 50” parameter, vcfutils vcf2fq with the “-d 10” parameter, and BCFtools (v 1.9) view with the “-D 100” parameter. After the input data are prepared, PSMC (v 0.6.5) is run with the default parameters. Subsequently, plots are generated using the script obtained from PSMC.</p>
          <p>In the case of the MSMC analysis, read alignment files are prepared in the MSMCFA format by SAMtools (v 1.9-36-gb6fea3c) mpileup with the “-C 50” parameter, BCFtools (v 1.9) call with the “-c and -V indel” parameter, and bamCaller.py in MSMC. Then, MSMC (v 2.0.0) is executed with the default parameters, and the final plots are generated using an in-house visualization script.</p>

          <p>To identify genomic regions showing with exceptional genetic variations in target populations, PAPipe uses VCFtools (v 0.1.17) (<xref rid="msae040-B13" ref-type="bibr">Danecek et al. 2011</xref>) to calculate the <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM23" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> value which is a measure of population differentiation. <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM24" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> estimation requires the size of a sliding window and the size of sliding step of that window. The default values are 100 Kbp for both the sizes of the sliding window and the sliding step. The <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM25" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> value is calculated based on a pair of population subsets. By default, PAPipe is configured to iteratively perform <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM26" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> estimation (i) for every single population by setting a single population as a target and the remaining populations as a comparator and (ii) for every possible pair of two populations. Users can also change target populations by modifying the population group parameter. For example, if two out of four populations are set as target populations in the parameter, PAPipe only executes the analysis once to calculates <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM27" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> values by comparing the target populations against the remaining ones.

      <title>Usability and Accessibility of PAPipe</title>
      <p>PAPipe has been designed with a focus on user-friendliness, and it incorporates several features with the intention of to enhancing usability. (i) A web page for setting program parameters: PAPipe provides researchers with a web page (<ext-link xlink:href="http://bioinfo.konkuk.ac.kr/PAPipe/parameter_builder/" ext-link-type="uri">http://bioinfo.konkuk.ac.kr/PAPipe/parameter_builder/</ext-link>) on which they can set various program parameters within a visual web interface, which then automatically generates the desired parameter file. (ii) A web page for browsing pipeline output: PAPipe provides a web page summarizing all generated output from all population analyses. (iii) A small test dataset for easily understanding the pipeline: PAPipe provides a small test dataset and parameter file, thus helping researchers understand how to best prepare the input data and parameter files. (iv) Increased parallelization level of the pipeline: the whole pipeline of PAPipe has been optimized for performance by automatically conducting fork management for all feasible components, with the ultimate aim of enhancing execution speed. The running time and disk usage of each part in PAPipe as a function of the number of threads were measured using the test dataset (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary table S6, Supplementary Material</xref> online).

      <title>Application of PAPipe to Cattle Populations</title>
      <p>For the application of PAPipe, five cattle breeds Angus, Holstein, Jersey, Simmental, and a Korean cattle breed called Hanwoo were selected.
