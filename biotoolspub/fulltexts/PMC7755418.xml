      <sec id="s1">
        <title>Motivation</title>
        <p>Despite of the lack of folded structure, intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins play versatile roles in various biological processes, and many nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants (nsSNVs) in IDRs are associated with human diseases. The continuous accumulation of nsSNVs resulted from the wide application of NGS has driven the development of disease-association prediction methods for decades. However, their performance on nsSNVs in IDRs remains inferior, possibly due to the domination of nsSNVs from structured regions in training data. Therefore, it is highly demanding to build a disease-association predictor specifically for nsSNVs in IDRs with better performance.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s2">
        <title>Results</title>
        <p>We present IDRMutPred, a machine learning-based tool specifically for predicting disease-associated germline nsSNVs in IDRs. Based on 17 selected optimal features that are extracted from sequence alignments, protein annotations, hydrophobicity indices and disorder scores, IDRMutPred was trained using three ensemble learning algorithms on the training dataset containing only IDR nsSNVs. The evaluation on the two testing datasets shows that all the three prediction models outperform 17 other popular general predictors significantly, achieving the ACC between 0.856 and 0.868 and MCC between 0.713 and 0.737. IDRMutPred will prioritize disease-associated IDR germline nsSNVs more reliably than general predictors.</p>

    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>The paradigm of ‘sequence-structure-function’ states that the protein sequence will fold into well-defined domain structure, and the folded structure will then fulfill specific function (<xref rid="btaa618-B13" ref-type="bibr">Edsall, 1995</xref>). This well-established dogma has been dominant in structural biology and has led to great successes in revealing the structural basis of numerous fundamental biological processes, including oxygen transport of hemoglobin (<xref rid="btaa618-B34" ref-type="bibr">Marengo-Rowe, 2006</xref>), protein translation of ribosome machine (<xref rid="btaa618-B54" ref-type="bibr">Schmeing and Ramakrishnan, 2009</xref>), enzymatic catalysis and so on. It has also played a vital part in understanding the disease mechanisms of genetic variants (<xref rid="btaa618-B56" ref-type="bibr">Stefl <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), and in structure-based drug discovery (<xref rid="btaa618-B2" ref-type="bibr">Anderson, 2003</xref>). On the other hand, a large fraction of protein segments, enriched with hydrophilic and charged residues, lack stable structures (<xref rid="btaa618-B3" ref-type="bibr">Babu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="btaa618-B29" ref-type="bibr">Lise and Jones, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="btaa618-B52" ref-type="bibr">Romero <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="btaa618-B64" ref-type="bibr">Uversky <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). These segments are named intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), and a large percentage of human proteins (35–44% due to different predictors and statistic methods) contain IDRs longer than 30 residues (<xref rid="btaa618-B44" ref-type="bibr">Pentony <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="btaa618-B68" ref-type="bibr">Van Der Lee <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="btaa618-B71" ref-type="bibr">Ward <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Previously regarded as ‘useless’, IDRs have been confirmed to have versatile regulatory functions by acting as entropic chains, effectors, scavengers, assemblers, chaperones and display sites (<xref rid="btaa618-B60" ref-type="bibr">Tompa, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="btaa618-B61" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; <xref rid="btaa618-B68" ref-type="bibr">Van Der Lee <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Malfunctioning of IDRs is associated with a broad spectrum of human diseases, such as cancers (<xref rid="btaa618-B22" ref-type="bibr">Iakoucheva <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="btaa618-B63" ref-type="bibr">Uversky <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), cardiovascular diseases (<xref rid="btaa618-B8" ref-type="bibr">Cheng <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), neurodegenerative diseases (<xref rid="btaa618-B48" ref-type="bibr">Raychaudhuri <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) and type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="btaa618-B65" ref-type="bibr">Uversky <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), and computational strategies for rational drug discovery that targets IDR are also emerging (<xref rid="btaa618-B53" ref-type="bibr">Ruan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). Overall, it was estimated that a substantial portion (∼20%) of pathogenic nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants (nsSNVs) are located in IDRs (<xref rid="btaa618-B67" ref-type="bibr">Vacic <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). For example, variant R306C in MECP2 leads to Rett syndrome (<xref rid="btaa618-B66" ref-type="bibr">Vacic and Iakoucheva, 2012</xref>), a host of variants in BRCA1 promote the development of breast cancer (<xref rid="btaa618-B35" ref-type="bibr">Mark <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) and the dileucine motif gain by variants in GLUT1 causes the GLUT1 deficiency syndrome (<xref rid="btaa618-B36" ref-type="bibr">Meyer <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Hence, studies on disease variants located at IDRs are as crucial as those in structured domains.</p>
    <p>Recent years have witnessed the unprecedented advances in next-generation sequencing techniques, and their wide applications in disease research such as whole exome sequencing have generated a huge amount of variant data (<xref rid="btaa618-B17" ref-type="bibr">Goodwin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Since the identified variants contain both disease-associated and non-disease (neutral) ones, the major challenge is to discriminate them in a high throughput manner (<xref rid="btaa618-B10" ref-type="bibr">Cooper and Shendure, 2011</xref>). While the experimental approaches are labor intensive and time consuming, a multitude of computational predictors have been developed, whose results can largely narrow down the variants pool for further experimental validation (<xref rid="btaa618-B41" ref-type="bibr">Niroula and Vihinen, 2016</xref>).</p>
    <p>Significant progress has been made in developing tools to predict disease-associated nsSNVs (<xref rid="btaa618-B51" ref-type="bibr">Riera <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Most of them are trained on variants from diverse protein families, and are thus general-purpose predictors. Among them, conservation and structural stability features have been used most widely (<xref rid="btaa618-B51" ref-type="bibr">Riera <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). However, the broadly distributed IDRs have neither ordered structures, nor are they as conserved as ordered regions (ORs) (<xref rid="btaa618-B5" ref-type="bibr">Brown <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), raising the concern that the disease-association prediction of variants in IDRs using general tools is supposed to be inferior. In fact, previous research observed that general predictors like SIFT encountered more misclassification on disease-associated nsSNVs in IDRs (<xref rid="btaa618-B37" ref-type="bibr">Mort <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Several studies have reported that the amount, the distribution and other characteristics of IDR variants (<xref rid="btaa618-B65" ref-type="bibr">Uversky <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="btaa618-B63" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; <xref rid="btaa618-B67" ref-type="bibr">Vacic <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), but there is currently no disease-association predictors for them. Considering the indispensable roles played by IDRs in function regulation and pathogenesis, and that the widely used sequencing technologies are continuing to generate a huge amount of variants in IDRs, it is highly desirable to build a disease-association predictor specifically for IDR variants.</p>
    <p>In this work, we have developed a machine learning-based disease-association predictor specifically for germline nsSNVs in IDRs (<xref rid="btaa618-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). First, a training and two testing datasets containing germline variants from IDRs was curated. Second, we extracted 175 features, and selected 17 optimal ones through feature selection. Third, three tree-based ensemble machine learning algorithms were adopted to train prediction models, and the comparison with other general prediction tools was conducted. Finally, a standalone package and its web server, namely IDRMutPred, was developed.

  <sec>
    <title>2 Materials and methods</title>
    <p>The overall pipeline of our work is illustrated in <xref rid="btaa618-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, and is described as follows.</p>
    <sec>
      <title>2.1 Datasets curation</title>
      <p>Human protein sequences were derived from UniProt/Swiss-Prot database (Release 2019_01 of January 16, 2019) (<xref rid="btaa618-B59" ref-type="bibr">The UniProt Consortium, 2019</xref>), and the germline nsSNVs were parsed accordingly from the file ‘humsavar.txt’ from the UniProt FTP server. The nsSNVs labeled with ‘Disease’ and ‘Polymorphism’, representing variants reported to be implicated in disease or not, were regarded as positive and negative samples, respectively.</p>
      <p>We regarded that a residue is located in IDR if it was experimentally annotated in DisProt (Release 7) database (<xref rid="btaa618-B46" ref-type="bibr">Piovesan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) or could be predicted as disordered by SPOT-Disorder (<xref rid="btaa618-B19" ref-type="bibr">Hanson <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). By screening out the nsSNVs located outside IDRs, we obtained the IDR nsSNV dataset. Random sampling was utilized to build a balanced dataset. About one-tenth of the dataset was kept for independent testing, while the remaining served as the training dataset for feature selection and model training. Another third-party dataset for further evaluation was based on ToolScores datasets (<xref rid="btaa618-B18" ref-type="bibr">Grimm <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>) from VariBench (<xref rid="btaa618-B38" ref-type="bibr">Nair and Vihinen, 2013</xref>). After aggregating its five member datasets, we deleted the nsSNVs with conflicting class labels, kept only one occurrence for duplicates with consistent class labels, and retained the IDR nsSNVs. The third-party dataset was then constructed by removing those that have occurred in the training set and selecting equal number of positive and negative samples.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.2 Feature extraction</title>
      <p>A total of 175 features were calculated for each of the IDR nsSNVs (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), and were subjected to further feature selection. These features can be categorized into 5 groups, including 2 substitution matrix scores, 152 sequence alignment features, 6 amino acid hydrophobicity scores, 9 protein-/gene-level annotations and 6 disorder scores, all feature values in the training data were standardized (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>). Feature values in the independent testing and the third-party dataset were transformed accordingly with the parameters derived during the standardization of training data.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.3 Feature selection</title>
      <p>Feature selection is a necessary part in machine learning because the initial feature set often contain unnecessary, irrelevant and redundant features, which may slow down the training procedure or introduce over-fitting (<xref rid="btaa618-B12" ref-type="bibr">Drotar <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). In this work, we implemented a feature selection strategy by combining forward selection and backward elimination, which wrapped a machine learning algorithm as the backend engine for evaluating the goodness of the feature subsets (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.4 Prediction model training</title>
      <p>We attempted three tree-based machine learning algorithms, including random forest (RF) (<xref rid="btaa618-B4" ref-type="bibr">Breiman, 2001</xref>), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) (<xref rid="btaa618-B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Guestrin, 2016</xref>) and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) (<xref rid="btaa618-B28" ref-type="bibr">Ke <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). RF is a classic machine learning framework by constructing a multitude of decision trees in parallel, while XGBoost and LightGBM are two more modern ones by constructing gradient boosting trees. Remarkably, LightGBM has faster training speed and lower memory usage (<xref rid="btaa618-B28" ref-type="bibr">Ke <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p>
      <p>For each algorithm, we randomly tried a series of hyperparameter combinations (random search), and we chose the one with the best AUC in the G10FCV (described in Section 2.5). After obtaining the best hyperparameter combination, we trained the final prediction models using all the training data accordingly. The feature importance was outputted to compare the relative contributions between different features, and Mann–Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic> test was performed when comparing each feature between disease and neutral nsSNVs. The python packages including scikit-learn v0.20.1 (<xref rid="btaa618-B42" ref-type="bibr">Pedregosa <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), xgboost v0.82 and lightgbm v2.2.1 were adopted in our work.</p>

    <sec>
      <title>2.5 Cross-validation and performance evaluation</title>
      <p>Tenfold cross-validation was utilized for finding the best hyperparameter combination. In the separation of data into 10 parts, we required that nsSNVs from the same protein would not be split into different data parts, i.e. the nsSNVs were split at the protein level. Technically, we implemented this process using the Python module GroupKFold in scikit-learn package (<xref rid="btaa618-B42" ref-type="bibr">Pedregosa <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), and it was referred to as grouped 10-fold cross-validation (G10FCV). Given a hyperparameter combination, the average performance obtained by G10FCV was adopted to measure the goodness of this hyperparameter combination. By trying various combinations of hyperparameters, one can select the optimal one.</p>
      <p>We adopted four comprehensive performance metrics, including accuracy (ACC), Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient (MCC), F1 score and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The detailed definitions are provided in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>.</p>
      <p>Using the testing datasets, we compared the performance of our models with 17 popular general predictors, including SIFT (<xref rid="btaa618-B39" ref-type="bibr">Ng and Henikoff, 2001</xref>), PolyPhen2 (<xref rid="btaa618-B1" ref-type="bibr">Adzhubei <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), PhD-SNP (<xref rid="btaa618-B6" ref-type="bibr">Capriotti <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), MutationAssessor (<xref rid="btaa618-B50" ref-type="bibr">Reva <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), FATHMM (<xref rid="btaa618-B55" ref-type="bibr">Shihab <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), PON-P2 (<xref rid="btaa618-B40" ref-type="bibr">Niroula <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), PROVEAN (<xref rid="btaa618-B9" ref-type="bibr">Choi and Chan, 2015</xref>), PANTHER-PSEP (<xref rid="btaa618-B57" ref-type="bibr">Tang and Thomas, 2016a</xref>), Eigen (<xref rid="btaa618-B24" ref-type="bibr">Ionita-Laza <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), REVEL (<xref rid="btaa618-B23" ref-type="bibr">Ioannidis <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), PMut2017 (<xref rid="btaa618-B31" ref-type="bibr">Lopez-Ferrando <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), MutPred2 (<xref rid="btaa618-B43" ref-type="bibr">Pejaver <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), CADD (<xref rid="btaa618-B49" ref-type="bibr">Rentzsch <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>), LIST (<xref rid="btaa618-B33" ref-type="bibr">Malhis <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>), MetaSVM (<xref rid="btaa618-B11" ref-type="bibr">Dong <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), MetaLR (<xref rid="btaa618-B11" ref-type="bibr">Dong <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>) and M-CAP (<xref rid="btaa618-B27" ref-type="bibr">Jagadeesh <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Among them, two versions of PolyPhen2 (pph2-HumDiv and pph2-HumVar) and FATHMM (weighted fathmm-W and unweighted fathmm-U) were both adopted in the comparison. The prediction results of PolyPhen2, MutationAssessor, PON-P2, PMut2017 and LIST were obtained using their web servers, and those of Eigen, REVEL, CADD, metaSVM/metaLR and M-CAP were downloaded from dbNSFP v3.5a (<xref rid="btaa618-B30" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). The prediction results of all other predictors were obtained by running their standalone programs with default settings locally.</p>

      <title>2.6 Implementation of the predictor</title>
      <p>To ease the application of our models, we implemented a standalone package to automate the whole process. Based on Python 3.6.6, a set of modules were implemented to calculate all necessary features. By feeding them into the trained models, this package can make predictions in high throughput.</p>
      <p>A web server was built to further facilitate the researchers without bioinformatics skills. The Django (v2.1.0) (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.djangoproject.com/</ext-link>) and Bootstrap library (v3.3.7) (<ext-link xlink:href="https://getbootstrap.com/" ext-link-type="uri">https://getbootstrap.com/</ext-link>) were utilized to construct the web framework, MySQL (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.mysql.com/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.mysql.com/</ext-link>) database management system was adopted to temporarily store the prediction results and to manage the submitted job queue, and Apache httpd (<ext-link xlink:href="https://httpd.apache.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://httpd.apache.org</ext-link>) was chosen to provide the web services.</p>

      <title>3.1 Construction of the training and testing datasets</title>
      <p>In total, 29 544 disease and 39 801 neutral nsSNVs located in 12 518 human proteins were derived from humsavar.txt provided by UniProt/Swiss-Prot (<xref rid="btaa618-B59" ref-type="bibr">The UniProt Consortium, 2019</xref>), and 78 732 IDRs were obtained. The integration of nsSNV and IDR resulted in 2793 disease-associated and 12 980 neutral nsSNVs located in IDRs from 6337 proteins (<xref rid="btaa618-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>A total of 2793 neutral nsSNVs were randomly sampled and were combined with the 2793 disease nsSNVs to build a balanced dataset. From it, 297 disease nsSNVs and 262 neutral nsSNVs (∼1/10 of the balanced dataset) were randomly chosen for independent testing, while the remaining were kept for training (<xref rid="btaa618-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We required that all nsSNVs from the same protein were either in the testing set or in the training set.

      <title>3.2 Optimal feature subset</title>
      <p>Our feature selection strategy is involved with a huge number of training iterations on various feature combinations, so the computational cost is demanding. Due to its speediness, we adopted LightGBM (<xref rid="btaa618-B28" ref-type="bibr">Ke <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) as the backend engine of feature selection. The procedure of feature selection on all of the 175 candidates resulted in an optimal feature subset with 17 features, including 9 sequence alignment features, 4 protein-/gene-level annotations, 3 hydrophobicity features and 1 disorder feature (<xref rid="btaa618-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The detailed feature definitions are provided in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>. In the alignment features, four of them are related to the frequencies of wild-type and mutant residues (#2, #3, #6, #7 in <xref rid="btaa618-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) in the forms of proportion or number of wild-type or mutant residues, or position weight matrix score; three directly describe the conservation of the nsSNV site in terms of relative entropy (#4, #8, #9); two represent the quality of the alignment (#1, #5). The selected gene-/protein-level features measure the variation tolerance (#12, #13), essentiality (#14) and recessive disease-association probability (#11) of the gene that bears the nsSNV. Other selected features measure the hydrophobicity of the microenvironment around the nsSNV site (#15, #17), the hydrophobicity difference between wild-type and mutant residues (#16), and the disorder level at the nsSNV site (#10).

      <title>3.3 Prediction model training and evaluation</title>
      <p>Based on G10FCV on the training dataset with the optimal features, we determined the best hyperparameter combination from 1000 randomly generated ones using RF, XGBoost and LightGBM, respectively. The best hyperparameters and the performance metrics of cross-validation are listed in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables S2 and S3</xref>. Using these best hyperparameters accordingly, the model parameters of the three prediction models were trained on the whole training dataset. Notably, our cross-validation is based on splitting nsSNVs at the protein level, which has avoided the so-called type 2 circularity (<xref rid="btaa618-B18" ref-type="bibr">Grimm <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). This strategy will decrease the risk of overly fitting the prediction models to protein-/gene-level features.</p>
      <p>Using the independent testing dataset, we directly compared the performance of our models with 14 of the 17 general-purpose predictors (<xref rid="btaa618-T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). The comparison shows that our models rank on the top tier for all of the four-performance metrics. In detail, our best ACC (0.868), MCC (0.737), F1 score (0.872) and AUC (0.934) have improved 3.3, 4.1, 1.2 and 0.5 percentage point, respectively, when compared to the best one in the other 13 predictors. The most significant improvement comes from MCC, a robust performance metric that balances positive and negative predictions.

      <p>We are curious about whether the homologous relationship between proteins from the testing set and those from the training set have conferred overly optimistic performance. Hence, we removed the testing data whose proteins are homologous to those in the training set using the cd-hit webserver (<xref rid="btaa618-B20" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>,<xref rid="btaa618-B21" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>) with 30% as cutoff. The datasets and the performance comparison before and after removing homologs (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables S4 and S5</xref>) demonstrate that the performance of our predictors remain similar, indicating that these homologous sequences in the testing dataset do not lead to overly optimistic results.</p>
      <p>The third-party dataset contains 2897 disease and 2897 neutral IDR nsSNVs, and the performance comparison on this dataset shows similar results (<xref rid="btaa618-T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). In detail, the best ACC (0.858), MCC (0.718), F1 score (0.856) and AUC (0.929) of our models have improved 1.6, 3.2, 2.1 and 2.1 percentage points, respectively, when compared to the best one in the other 13 predictors. The improvement of MCC is also the most significant in this comparison.</p>
      <p>It is worth noting that the independent testing dataset and the third-party dataset have no overlap with our training set. However, some of the testing nsSNVs may be in the training set of other predictors, which may not properly estimate their performance. For example, PMut2017 and PON-P2 used humsavar (October 2016 release) and VariBench for training, respectively (<xref rid="btaa618-B31" ref-type="bibr">Lopez-Ferrando <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="btaa618-B40" ref-type="bibr">Niroula <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Therefore, the above comparisons may have underestimated the improved magnitude of our models. When a testing dataset having no overlap with any of the training datasets of all compared predictors is available, the improvement would hopefully be larger.</p>
      <p>Moreover, when comparing the performance of each predictor between the independent testing and the third-party dataset, our predictors are stable, while many others manifest large variance. All of these comparisons demonstrate that our IDR-specific models are robustly better in prioritizing pathogenic IDR nsSNVs from neutral ones than general predictors.</p>
      <p>As for the other three of the 17 general-purpose predictors, i.e. MetaSVM, MetaLR and M-CAP, our models also showed superior performance on the two testing datasets (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S6</xref>), with the only exception that the F1 score of M-CAP is slightly better. Because MetaSVM and MetaLR directly used allele frequency (AF) as a feature, and M-CAP adopted the prediction scores of MetaSVM/MetaLR as their features, we also supplemented ExAC-based AF to our optimal feature subset to re-train our models for the fair comparison with them.</p>
      <p>Another concern is how our models will perform on nsSNVs whose proteins contain both disease and neutral nsSNVs. To inspect this, from ToolScores datasets (<xref rid="btaa618-B18" ref-type="bibr">Grimm <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>) we removed nsSNVs that have occurred in the training data, and then selected proteins that contain both disease and neutral variants. After this filtering, we obtained a dataset with 2475 disease-associated and 873 neutral IDR nsSNVs from 321 proteins, and conducted an additional evaluation (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S7</xref>). Although the ACC and MCC have decreased, they are still high (though not ideal) with MCC greater than 0.61 and ACC greater than 0.84. Moreover, the performance of our models remains on the top tier, with other predictors dropping more. These results also demonstrated that predicting the disease-association of nsSNVs whose proteins have both disease and neutral variants are more challenging.</p>

      <title>3.4 Feature analysis</title>
      <p>To investigate relative contribution of the features in the optimal feature subset, we plotted the feature importance of each feature for the three models (<xref rid="btaa618-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). Although different models have no identical rank of relative feature importance, they provide some consensus insights: several alignment and gene-/protein-level features contribute more than others. The distributions of the standardized <italic toggle="yes">Z</italic>-scores of each feature in the disease and neutral group are shown in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>. We inspect several representative features in detail here.

      </fig>
      <p>Conservation features are one group of the most distinguishable features for predicting disease-associated nsSNVs (<xref rid="btaa618-B41" ref-type="bibr">Niroula and Vihinen, 2016</xref>). One may concern whether these features remain powerful in predicting disease nsSNVs in IDRs, as they are of lower sequence conservation (<xref rid="btaa618-B5" ref-type="bibr">Brown <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="btaa618-B57" ref-type="bibr">Tang and Thomas, 2016b</xref>). Our results show that several conservation features were selected and ranked on top (<xref rid="btaa618-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). To inspect them further, we compared one of these features (the relative entropy based on the alignment with homologous non-human proteins in UniRef100, feature #9 in <xref rid="btaa618-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) between variants in IDRs and in ORs. The conservation levels in IDRs are indeed lower than in ORs (the lower the relative entropy, the higher the conservation level according to our definition in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>), which is consistent with previous knowledge (<xref rid="btaa618-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Even though, the distributions of this feature are evidently distinguishable between disease and neutral nsSNVs, either in ORs or in IDRs. In OR nsSNVs, the feature medians of disease and neutral nsSNVs are 2.73 and 3.84, respectively (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value: 0, Mann–Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic> test); in IDR nsSNVs, the medians are 2.85 and 4.56, accordingly (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value: 0, Mann–Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic> test), showing even more evident separation in IDR nsSNVs (<xref rid="btaa618-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Hence, it is reasonable that the conservation or conservation-related features were selected.

      <p>Certain protein-/gene-level annotations can prioritize disease genes and provide information for further prioritization of variants (<xref rid="btaa618-B25" ref-type="bibr">Itan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Our work has selected four protein-/gene-level features, and all the three trained models ranked them within the top 10 (<xref rid="btaa618-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). This observation hints that incorporation of gene-/protein-level features is beneficial in training predictors for disease nsSNVs. One of them is the score estimating the probability that a gene is a recessive disease gene (feature #11 in <xref rid="btaa618-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This score has been widely used to discriminate Loss-of-Function tolerant genes (with low score) from recessive disease genes (with high score) (<xref rid="btaa618-B32" ref-type="bibr">MacArthur <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). In our dataset, the feature values in the disease group are significantly higher than those in the neutral group (<xref rid="btaa618-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), indicating that disease-related nsSNVs tend to come from recessive disease genes. The medians of disease and neutral nsSNVs are 0.417 and 0.121 in IDRs, respectively (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value: 1.01E-59, Mann–Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic> test), while in OR these values are 0.333 and 0.152, respectively (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value: 1.70E-70, Mann–Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic> test). Similar to the conservation, the separation of this feature between disease and neutral nsSNVs in IDRs is much larger than that in ORs, illustrating that it may have more potential in predicting disease nsSNVSs in IDRs than in ORs. As protein-/gene-level features cannot differentiate nsSNVs from the same protein, it is necessary to conduct cross-validation at the protein level in optimizing the hyperparameters of the prediction models (G10FCV in this work), and to perform additional evaluations on the dataset derived from proteins containing both disease and neutral variants (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S7</xref>).</p>
      <p>Hydrophobicity and disorder-related features have been demonstrated informative in developing general predictors (<xref rid="btaa618-B1" ref-type="bibr">Adzhubei <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="btaa618-B20" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010a</xref>; <xref rid="btaa618-B73" ref-type="bibr">Ye <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). In this work, several selected features measure the sum of hydrophobicity propensity of a short peptide segment centered with the nsSNV site, i.e. hydrophobicity microenvironment, or the hydrophobicity differences between substituted residues. The disorder score of the wild-type residue at the nsSNV site has also been selected. Although their feature importance ranks are relatively low when compared to other types of features (<xref rid="btaa618-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>), their distributions between disease and neutral nsSNVs are still informative (<xref rid="btaa618-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C and D</xref>). For the hydrophobicity difference, the medians of disease and neutral nsSNVs are 0.18 and 0.05 in IDRs, respectively (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value: 0.001, Mann–Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic> test); In ORs, these two values are 0.03 and 0.05 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value: 3.08E-7, Mann–Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic> test). The larger median of disease nsSNVs in IDRs may indicate that a larger portion of disease nsSNV have been substituted from hydrophilic to hydrophobic residues. Larger separation between disease and neutral nsSNVs in IDRs than in ORs can be observed as well.</p>
      <p>The disorder score and the DisProt annotation have been adopted to separate the IDRs from ORs in dataset curation, so the disorder scores of IDR nsSNVs are much larger than OR nsSNVs (<xref rid="btaa618-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Moreover, the medians of disease and neutral nsSNVs are 0.852 and 0.906 in IDRs, respectively (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value: 6.84E-14, Mann–Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic> test), while these values are 0.041 and 0.061 in ORs (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value: 0, Mann–Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic> test). The difference of medians between disease and neutral nsSNVs in IDRs is larger than that in ORs, which may also indicate that disorder scores have more potential to separate disease and neutral nsSNVs in IDRs than in ORs.</p>

      <title>3.5 The standalone package and web server</title>
      <p>Although the performance of the three models in our work is similar, we choose the LightGBM-based model as the default since it is much faster. The RF-based and XGBoost-based models are also provided as the options. The standalone package and the web server of our method, namely IDRMutPred, are freely available at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.wdspdb.com/IDRMutPred" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.wdspdb.com/IDRMutPred</ext-link>. Anaconda was utilized to install all necessary packages and to share the running environment (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.anaconda.com/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.anaconda.com/</ext-link>), so the users can install and configure a local copy of IDRMutPred smoothly, which will be convenient for high throughput runs. The versions of the related Python packages are listed in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S8</xref>. In addition, a Docker image of the standalone IDRMutPred is also freely available at the website.</p>
      <p>IDRMutPred requires that the user should provide a protein sequence and a list of amino acid substitutions. The output contains the prediction score in the range between 0 and 1, and the binary classification is based on the default cutoff of 0.5. The users can further prioritize the disease-associated nsSNVs by ranking the scores.</p>
    </sec>
  </sec>
  <sec>
    <title>4 Discussion</title>
    <p>The better performance of IDRMutPred may roughly stem from several aspects. First, general predictors are ‘one-size-fits-all’ models based on training data from heterogeneous protein families or protein segments (<xref rid="btaa618-B51" ref-type="bibr">Riera <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="btaa618-B66" ref-type="bibr">Vacic and Iakoucheva, 2012</xref>), while IDRMutPred has been trained on pure IDR nsSNVs, which are more homogeneous. It is reasonable to train better specific predictors on homogeneous datasets due to lower noise. Developing specific predictors has been practiced in several studies like KinMutRF, wKinMut-2, iFish and others (<xref rid="btaa618-B15" ref-type="bibr">Fechter and Porollo, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="btaa618-B26" ref-type="bibr">Izarzugaza <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="btaa618-B47" ref-type="bibr">Pons <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="btaa618-B69" ref-type="bibr">Vazquez <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="btaa618-B70" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Wei, 2016</xref>).</p>
    <p>Second, homogeneous training data help to highlight informative features accordingly (<xref rid="btaa618-B62" ref-type="bibr">Torkamani and Schork, 2007</xref>). Intuitively, several features in our work have shown more evident contrast between disease and neutral nsSNVs in IDRs than in ORs, e.g. the relative entropy (<xref rid="btaa618-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). If we combine the IDR with OR nsSNVs, the contrast between disease and neutral nsSNVs will be smaller, i.e. less informative. These features will contribute more in IDR nsSNVs predictors than in general ones, and will be supposed to result in the better performance of IDRMutPred.</p>
    <p>In summary, our work presents the first IDR nsSNV-specific predictor, IDRMutPred, which will hopefully serve as a valuable tool in the research community that focuses on the study of nsSNVs, especially those located in IDRs.</p>
