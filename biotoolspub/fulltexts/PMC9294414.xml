      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are primarily regulated by their cellular localization, which is responsible for their molecular functions, including cell cycle regulation and genome rearrangements. Accurately identifying the subcellular location of lncRNAs from sequence information is crucial for a better understanding of their biological functions and mechanisms. In contrast to traditional experimental methods, bioinformatics or computational methods can be applied for the annotation of lncRNA subcellular locations in humans more effectively. In the past, several machine learning-based methods have been developed to identify lncRNA subcellular localization, but relevant work for identifying cell-specific localization of human lncRNA remains limited. In this study, we present the first application of the tree-based stacking approach, TACOS, which allows users to identify the subcellular localization of human lncRNA in 10 different cell types. Specifically, we conducted comprehensive evaluations of six tree-based classifiers with 10 different feature descriptors, using a newly constructed balanced training dataset for each cell type. Subsequently, the strengths of the AdaBoost baseline models were integrated via a stacking approach, with an appropriate tree-based classifier for the final prediction. TACOS displayed consistent performance in both the cross-validation and independent assessments compared with the other two approaches employed in this study. The user-friendly online TACOS web server can be accessed at <ext-link xlink:href="https://balalab-skku.org/TACOS" ext-link-type="uri">https://balalab-skku.org/TACOS</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>RNA is one of the main components in the central dogma of molecular biology and plays vital roles in different biological processes [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Early sequencing data have shown that &gt;80% of the mammalian genome is transcribed into noncoding regions, whereas only a smaller portion is transcribed into protein coding RNAs [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Owing to the advancements in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics analysis, an increasing number of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been identified, including circular RNAs, long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) and small ncRNAs [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref>]. ncRNAs are the largest constituent of the transcriptome that do not possess functional open reading frames, but play potent roles in several biological processes, including disease pathogenesis [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Genomes undergo extensive transcription, resulting in thousands of lncRNAs that are &gt;200 nucleotides in length and do not undergo translation to become functional proteins. They function as decoys, enhancer RNAs, guide, scaffold, signal and short peptides [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. lncRNAs can modulate chromatin function, affect signaling mechanisms, alter the stability of cytoplasmic mRNAs translation and regulate the assembly and function of nuclear bodies based on their localization and interactions with other biological macromolecules. Several of these functions affect gene expression in diverse biological and pathophysiological pathways such as in cancer, immune responses and neuronal diseases [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
    <p>As evidenced, the human genome constitutes &gt;16 000 lncRNA genes [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; however, other sources have predicted &gt;100 000 lncRNAs [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. To date, only a small portion of lncRNAs have been characterized; hence, it is necessary to identify the functional characterization of others [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, the versatile functions of lncRNAs are determined by their subcellular localizations. Hence, understanding the cellular localizations of lncRNAs will help decipher their potential molecular mechanisms.</p>
    <p><italic toggle="yes">In situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) is a popular technique to identify the cellular localization of candidate lncRNAs using labeled complementary oligonucleotide probes [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Single-molecule fluorescence ISH is the gold standard method, in which multiple probes are utilized to amplify the fluorescent signal for the detection of target RNAs, which are present in low levels [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In contrast, fluorescent <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> RNA sequencing method provides <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> information at high-throughput levels [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Spatially resolved transcript amplicon readout mapping is another method in which three-dimensional locational information on RNA expression in intact tissue samples is provided [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. As the identified lncRNAs outnumber those with known localizations, it is necessary to implement rapid, efficient and cost-effective computational methods to assist in their identifications.</p>
    <p>To date, only a few computational approaches have been developed to predict lncRNA subcellular localization across tissues/cell lines [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18–22</xref>]. Cao <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] proposed a predictor named lncLocator, which was developed based on the RNALocate database [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], to determine five localizations. This predictor adopts k-mer frequency information features with random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and an autoencoder. To construct a balanced training model dataset, lncLocator utilized the synthetic minority oversampling technique [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In 2018, Gudenas and Wang [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] developed DeepLncRNA, which predicts lncRNA subcellular localization directly from transcript sequences. They analyzed 93 strand-specific RNA-seq samples from multiple cell types by extracting k-mer frequencies using deep neural networks. Su <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] developed iLoc-lncRNA by incorporating 8-tuple nucleotide features into the general Psuedo <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-tupler composition (PseKNC) using SVM. Recently, Ahmad <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] developed Locate-R by extracting k-mer features using a deep local SVM to classify four locations. Recently, Lin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> developed lncLocator 2.0 [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] as a cell-line-specific subcellular localization predictor using an interpretable deep-learning approach. Among the existing predictors, lncLocator 2.0, is the only cell-specific predictor available, but it has sufficient room for improvement. To develop a machine learning (ML)-based predictor, it is necessary to devise appropriate encoding approaches to represent the lncRNA sequence fragments surrounding subcellular localization across tissues/cell lines.</p>
    <p>In this study, we developed a Tree-based Algorithm for Cell-specific long nOn-coding RNA Subcellular location (TACOS) for the accurate detection of cell-specific human lncRNA subcellular locations, an overview of which is shown in <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. First, we constructed a balanced training datasets for each of the 10 different cell types, including A549, GM12878, H1 human embryonic stem cell line (HESC), HeLa.S3 (HELA), Hep G2 (HEPG), HT1080, HUVEC, NHEK, SK.MEL.5 (SKMEL) and <ext-link xlink:href="http://SK.N.SH" ext-link-type="uri">SK.N.SH</ext-link> (SKNS). Utilizing a balanced training dataset for each cell type, we tested six different tree-based classifiers [RF, extremely gradient boosting (XGB), AdaBoost (AB), gradient boosting (GB), light GB (LGB) and extremely randomized tree (ERT)] using 10 different feature descriptors (which cover composition and physicochemical properties) and identified appropriate classifier-based baseline models. Subsequently, we integrated these 10 baseline models predicted probability values with an appropriate tree-based classifier through stacking strategy to make the final prediction. Notably, TACOS is the first application of tree-based algorithms employed for identifying cell-specific lncRNA subcellular locations. TACOS will be able to assist experimentalists in identifying novel lncRNA locations and elucidating their functions on a larger scale.</p>

      <title>Dataset construction</title>
      <p>To develop a prediction model based on sequence information, lncRNA nucleotide sequences and localization information are required. Recently, Lin <italic toggle="yes">et a</italic>l. [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] recently constructed a high-quality dataset based on nucleotide sequences with variable lengths obtained from the GENCODE project [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and localization information obtained from lncATLAS [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In order to determine the location of lncRNA, the authors used the cytoplasm/nucleus relative concentration index (CNRCI) for different cell types and determined that if CNRCI is &gt;1, the lncRNA is located within the cytoplasm, and if it is &lt;−1, it is located within the nucleus. These data are available through the following link: <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/Yang-J-LIN/lncLocator2" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/Yang-J-LIN/lncLocator2</ext-link>. For each cell type, they generated nonredundant datasets by applying the CD-HIT [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] threshold of 0.8, which means that none of the sequences shared &gt;80% sequence identity. Specifically, the total dataset was divided into 8/1/1 sets and used as train/dev/test sets, where train and dev sets were used for parameter optimization and model building, and the test sets were used to evaluate the model.</p>
      <p>We utilized the same sequence and respective classification information in the current study with the following modifications: (i) the train and dev datasets were combined to generate new training dataset for each cell type, resulting in a greater proportion of negative samples than positive samples. By utilizing an imbalanced dataset, any classifier will ultimately introduce class biases during cross-validation/training. (ii) To avoid such circumstances, we considered all positive samples and an equal number of negative samples randomly selected from the original samples. (iii) The leftover negative samples from the new training dataset were considered as negative samples for the independent dataset and supplemented with the same positive samples from the test set. A statistical summary of the dataset employed in this study is provided in the <xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, where the training samples comprise equal numbers of positives and negatives. In contrast, an independent dataset that replicates the actual scenario contains an imbalanced data.</p>

      <title>Feature extraction</title>
      <p>Feature extraction is one of the most critical steps in constructing an ML model. In general, multiple feature encodings [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28–31</xref>] should be explored on a single dataset, rather than exploring on collection of specific encodings. In this study, we investigated 10 different encodings for each cell type and assessed their ability to distinguish positive samples from negative samples.

      <p>The present study focused on predicting subcellular localization of lncRNAs, which is a binary classification problem. The purpose of this study was to determine whether lncRNAs are located in the cytoplasm or the nucleus. To identify the optimal ML algorithms, we investigated six tree-based approaches: RF [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], ERT [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], XGB, AB, LGB and GB. All of these classifiers have been widely applied to diverse bioinformatics sequence-based function prediction tasks [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38–40</xref>]. Importantly, these classifiers are capable of handling unnormalized features more efficiently than SVMs and deep learning algorithms that use normalized features. Grid search and 10-fold cross-validation were used to optimize the hyperparameters for each classifier [<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], the parameter search ranges of which are provided in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>.

      <title>Evaluation of trees-based algorithms for 10 different cell types using training datasets</title>
      <p>We carried out a comprehensive analysis of the prediction performance of six classifiers (RF, ERT, LGB, GB, XGB and AB) using 10 different feature descriptors and 10-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, the 10-fold cross-validation was repeated 10 times and the average metrics for 10 cell types was reported (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures S1</xref>–<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10</xref>). According to <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures S1</xref>–<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref>, five different encodings F4, F5, F6, KC and PseKNC in nine different cell types (except HESC) have similar performances regardless of the classifier, which is superior to the remaining encodings. Nevertheless, eight different encodings for HESC (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>) showed comparable performance (except F1 and DPCP) regardless of the classifier. In order to obtain an overview of the performances and to understand the level of dataset difficulty, we averaged 10 feature-descriptors-based models for each classifier, and the results are shown in <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. Considering that we deal with a balanced training datasets and imbalanced independent datasets, MCC is an appropriate metric that has been recommended in previous studies [<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The average MCC of the different classifiers for the three cell types (A549, HESC and SKNS) was above 0.48, which indicates that it is relatively easier to distinguish the cytoplasm from the nucleus when compared with the remaining seven cell types. However, the average MCC of the two cell types (HUVEC and SKMEL cells) was below 0.35, indicating that they are the most challenging cell types for classifying cytoplasm/nuclei. Furthermore, on average, the AB classifier consistently performed well on the training datasets for 10 different cell types.</p>

Evidently, AB-PseKNC model consistently produces the best overall metrics, including MCC, ACC and AUC values. Specifically, it achieved MCC scores of 0.629, 0.455, 0.534, 0.485, 0.619, 0.484, 0.411, 0.492, 0.394 and 0.561, respectively, for A549, GM128, HELA, HEPG, HESC, HT1080, HUVEC, NHEK, SKMEL and SKNS. It is noteworthy that the majority of the remaining classifiers also achieved their best performance with PseKNC encoding, yet the metrics were lower than the AB, indicating that the level of discriminative pattern between cytoplasm and nucleus exhibited in PseKNC is higher than that of the other encodings. Among the tree-based algorithms used, the AB classifier effectively identified hidden patterns from PseKNC, resulting in superior performance for all cell types.</p>

It is noteworthy that not only the average MCC, but also the best AB-based single model outperformed their counterparts across all cell types (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Specifically, single models AB-F4, AB-PseKNC, AB-PseKNC, AB-PseKNC, AB-KC, AB-PseKNC, AB-F6, AB-KC and AB-PseKNC each achieved the MCC values of 0.472, 0.277, 0.384, 0.320, 0.464, 0.316, 0.199, 0.271, 0.258 and 0.399 for A549, GM128, HELA, HEPG, HESC, HT1080, HUVEC, NHEK, SKMEL and SKNS.</p>

      <p>It is interesting to note that three encodings (F4, F6 and KC) were able to achieve their best performance on four different cell types during independent evaluation, but their performance was relatively average during cross-validation. However, the AB-based best baseline model (AB-PseKNC) for six species (GM128, HELA, HEPG, HESC, HUVEC and SKNS), obtained based on cross-validation performance or training, maintained a similar level of performance (in terms of ACC) during the independent evaluation. The absolute difference in ACC for these six species models was &lt;6%, indicating their robustness compared with the other models. In general, it is straightforward to select the most consistent model for each cell type. By contrast, we employed different strategies to enhance the robustness of the model.</p>

      <p>(i) Strategy (S1): We combined all the feature descriptors linearly and created a hybrid feature, which was fed into a tree-based algorithm for the development of respective prediction models using 10-fold cross-validation. Subsequently, we compared the six models and selected the one with the highest MCC. The feature selection technique described in a previous study [<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] was applied to the hybrid features, but it did not improve the prediction performance as much as anticipated (data not shown). Therefore, the control (hybrid feature based) was considered as the final model.</p>
      <p>(ii) Strategy 2 (S2): The AB-based classifier achieved the best performance on both cross-validation and independent datasets; therefore, we only considered AB-based baseline models based on 10 feature descriptors for each cell type. The predicted probability values of the cytoplasmic location derived from these 10 models were integrated, and stacked model was developed using an appropriate classifier derived from tree-based classifiers.</p>
      <p>(iii) Strategy 3 (S3): Unlike in S2, all six classifiers-based baseline models were considered. In total, we obtained 60 baseline models (6 classifiers <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX" id="ineq07">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <p>The performance of different strategies (S1–S3) for each cell type, based on both cross-validation and independent assessments is shown in <xref rid="TB2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. We observed that in addition to AB, other classifiers (GB and XGB) achieved a superior performance for S1 in a few cell types. In the case of S2, most tree-based algorithms (except RF) were used at least once in the stacking approach. However, for S3, only three classifiers (RF, GB and ERT) were used for each cell type. These results suggest that it is important to conduct experiments using different tree-based classifiers while employing a variety of strategies. In terms of MCC, S3 consistently outperforms S2 and S1 approaches on the training datasets of the 10 cell types (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, S2 consistently performed better than both S1 and S3 approaches on independent datasets (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). The S2 approach demonstrates greater consistency than the other two approaches. Therefore, we selected S2-based models for 10 cell types and named them TACOS.</p>

      <p>We compared the performance of TACOS with that of lncLocator 2.0, which is the only available cell-specific predictor. It is important to note that lncLocator 2.0 used different training datasets for model development, assessed using very small independent datasets and reported only AUC values [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, we compared the reported values with those of TACOS. <xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> shows that TACOS consistently outperformed lncLocator 2.0 across all 10 cell types. Specific improvements of AUC values for A549, GM128, HELA, HT108, HUVEC, HEPG, NHEK, SKMEL, SKNS and HESC are 1.1, 13.5, 7.6, 10.7, 10.6, 10.2, 6.4, 15.5, 9.0 and 3.4%, respectively. According to this analysis, TACOS’s improvement is remarkable compared with the existing method.</p>

      <title>Feature relevant analysis between the 10 probabilistic features</title>
      <p>The TACOS model has 10 different feature descriptors, each of which was used to generate a probabilistic feature using an AB classifier. Next, we evaluated whether the 10 feature models were equally relevant to different species. <xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> illustrates a cluster heat map of the correlations between the 10 probabilistic features, which provides answers to the question raised above. The results showed that the probabilistic features based on F2, F3, F4, F5, F6 and KC descriptors were highly correlated with each other. Nevertheless, the two probabilistic features based on PseKNC and CKSNAP were moderately correlated with the other features. Accordingly, these features complement each other to improve the prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, it is evident that the pattern of feature correlation is similar among all the cell types. Further analysis based on different cell types is required to confirm the levels of different features contributions in the final prediction.</p>

In contrast, the probabilistic features (predicted output of AB-based baseline models) depicted two distinct clusters, with little overlap between the two samples for A549 and HESC cells (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S12</xref>). The feature distribution was directly correlated with the performance, where A549 and HESC produced ACC values of 0.823 and 0.813, respectively. The remaining cell types achieved an ACC in the range of 70–80.0%, but feature overlaps between positive and negative samples still exist, suggesting that adopting novel feature encoding will improve prediction performance and distinguish positively and negatively skewed samples.</p>

      <p>It is common for a cell-specific model to perform exceptionally well with its own cell type. Specifically, we investigated whether a cell-specific model could be applied to other cell types.

Similarly, the HELA model was transferrable to three other types: HEPG, HT1080 and GM12878. Additionally, A549, HT1080 and HUVEC models were transferrable to other two cell types, indicating that cell-specific models perform reasonably well on other types as well. However, the four cell-specific models (NHEK, SKMEL, SKNS and HESC) were not transferable to other types of cells, suggesting that cell specificity is the dominant characteristic of these lncRNA sequences. Based on our analysis, we found that highly accurate predictions required cell-specific models. Additionally, this provides a clue for developing a generic model by combining six cell types (A549, GM12878, HELA, HT108, HEPG and NHEK). Generic models can also be applied to other cell types by compromising a slightly lower performance than cell-specific models.</p>

      <title>Limitations of the current study</title>
      <p>Although TACOS can predict cell-specific lncRNA localization, it has the following limitations:</p>
      <p>(i) TACOS is an ML-based approach based on multiple manually derived features derived from sequences. It is widely recognized that the effectiveness of ML models is highly dependent on the feature representations used during training [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29–31</xref>]. Accordingly, this study only considered composition and physicochemical properties. Further improvements in the prediction performance may be achieved by incorporating features based on other perspectives, including evolutionary information and novel features, based on extensive sequence analysis. Therefore, in future, we plan to explore and incorporate this information to improve the performance.</p>
      <p>(ii) TACOS predicts subcellular localization based on the assumption that a given sequence belongs to a lncRNA. It is necessary to use another prediction model to identify lncRNAs from given RNA sequences before TACOS can be used. Currently, a few methods are available for identifying lncRNAs from RNA sequences [<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. It is recommended to use these methods to identify lncRNAs before using TACOS. An additional prediction model will be integrated with TACOS in the future, able to identify lncRNAs and subcellular localization based upon the given mRNA sequence.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>In this study, we present a method called TACOS that allows accurate identification of the subcellular localization of human cell-specific lncRNAs using multiple feature encodings and tree-based algorithms. In order to identify the most suitable ML algorithm, we conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation of six different tree-based algorithms using 10 different feature descriptors. On average, AB-based baseline models performed well for all cell types in both cross-validation and independent assessment.</p>
    <p>Subsequently, an optimal tree-based algorithm was utilized to construct the stacking model, using the predicted probability values from 10 AB-based baseline models for each cell type to improve the prediction performance. Our approach differs from the previous methods because we developed TACOS using a balanced training dataset and evaluated it using a large imbalanced independent dataset. TACOS performed consistently well on both datasets (training and independent) compared with the two other strategies employed in this study.</p>
    <p>The improved performance of TACOS is attributed to three factors: (i) the exploration of extensive feature descriptors that include different aspects of RNA sequence information, (ii) the selection of AB-specific baseline models and (iii) the identification of an appropriate classifier for building a stacking model that incorporates the strength of baseline models. It should be noted that the tree-based approaches employed in this study are applicable to other sequence-based function prediction problems [<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], including enhancer prediction [<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and replication origin site prediction [<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In future studies, a systematic approach similar to that used in this study will be employed if more than two locations with a reasonable dataset size are publicly available. Moreover, we developed the TACOS webserver and made them freely available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://balalab-skku.org/TACOS" ext-link-type="uri">https://balalab-skku.org/TACOS</ext-link>. TACOS is expected to be an invaluable tool for experimentalists to identify the subcellular localization of lncRNAs, which will be useful for carrying out subsequent experiments to better understand its function.</p>
