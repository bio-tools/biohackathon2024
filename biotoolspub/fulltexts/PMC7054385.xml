    <abstract>
      <p>One of the ubiquitous chemical modifications in RNA, pseudouridine modification is crucial for various cellular biological and physiological processes. To gain more insight into the functional mechanisms involved, it is of fundamental importance to precisely identify pseudouridine sites in RNA. Several useful machine learning approaches have become available recently, with the increasing progress of next-generation sequencing technology; however, existing methods cannot predict sites with high accuracy. Thus, a more accurate predictor is required. In this study, a random forest-based predictor named RF-PseU is proposed for prediction of pseudouridylation sites. To optimize feature representation and obtain a better model, the light gradient boosting machine algorithm and incremental feature selection strategy were used to select the optimum feature space vector for training the random forest model RF-PseU. Compared with previous state-of-the-art predictors, the results on the same benchmark data sets of three species demonstrate that RF-PseU performs better overall. The integrated average leave-one-out cross-validation and independent testing accuracy scores were 71.4% and 74.7%, respectively, representing increments of 3.63% and 4.77% versus the best existing predictor. Moreover, the final RF-PseU model for prediction was built on leave-one-out cross-validation and provides a reliable and robust tool for identifying pseudouridine sites.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>More than 150 types of chemical modification have been identified in cellular RNA, including adenosine methylation, cytosine modification, isomerization of uridine, and ribose modification (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Boccaletto et al., 2018</xref>). These modifications have critical roles in cellular biological and physiological processes (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Song and Yi, 2017</xref>). For instance, one of the most prevalent RNA modifications in eukaryotes, N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m6A), affects RNA stability (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), RNA-protein interaction (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2015b</xref>), RNA splicing and translation (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Meyer and Jaffrey, 2014</xref>), the circadian clock (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Fustin et al., 2013</xref>), immune response (<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">Winkler et al., 2019</xref>), etc. Another widespread RNA modification is 5-methylcytosine (m5C), which has functions including preservation of the secondary structure of tRNA (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Motorin and Helm, 2010</xref>), control of amino-acylation (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Helm, 2006</xref>), codon identification and metabolic stability (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Agris, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2017</xref>). The pseudouridine modification is another common post-transcriptional modification in various living organisms (<xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">Zaringhalam and Papavasiliou, 2016</xref>). In 1951, pseudouridine was first identified, and experiments in 1960 revealed that it was abundant in tRNA and rRNA (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Cohn, 1960</xref>). Pseudouridine results from an isomerization of uridine by breaking the glycosidic bond with 180° base rotation (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Karijolich et al., 2015</xref>). This modification has been shown to have vital roles, for instance, in stabilizing RNA and in the stress response (<xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">Zhao and He, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>).</p>
    <p>Although RNA pseudouridylation was discovered decades ago, the first transcriptome-wide RNA pseudouridylation map was not published until 2014, following the rapid development of next-generation sequencing technology (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Goodwin et al., 2016</xref>). <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Carlile et al. (2014)</xref> developed the PseudoU-seq technology, which they used to identify more than 200 pseudouridylation sites in the regulated mRNA of yeast and human cells; in the same year, <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Schwartz et al. (2014)</xref> performed transcriptome-wide mapping using a similar protocol, finding more than 300 dynamic-regulated pseudouridine sites in non-coding RNA and mRNA. <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. (2015a)</xref> presented a chemical labeling method (CeU-Seq) that they used to pull down more than 2000 pseudouridine sites in human mRNA. Other RNA pseudouridylation sequencing protocols were also developed (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Carlile et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
    <p>As an alternative to costly and labor-intensive laboratory experiments, robust, swift, and inexpensive computational methods for RNA chemical modification prediction have emerged recently, owing to the increasing amount of data generated in this post-genomics era (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Libbrecht and Noble, 2015</xref>). A large number of m6A (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2018a</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2019a</xref>; <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">Zou et al., 2019</xref>) and m5C (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Sabooh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Yin et al., 2019</xref>) site predictors based on traditional machine learning and emerging deep learning algorithms have been proposed. However, few computational tools have been developed to predict pseudouridine sites. <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. (2015b)</xref> used a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to design a web server called PPUS for the identification of pseudouridine sites in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>. <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. (2016)</xref> constructed another SVM-based web server for pseudouridine site prediction, using the frequency composition of the nucleotides and pseudo K-tuple nucleotide composition (PseKNC) for feature representation. <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">He et al. (2018)</xref> presented another model, PseUI, to identify pseudouridine sites in RNA sequences from three species (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and <italic>M. musculus</italic>); this was an SVM-based model incorporating multiple feature-extraction technologies. <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Tahir et al. (2019)</xref> used convolutional neural networks to design a new predictor, iPseU-CNN; and <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. (2019b)</xref> developed the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGboost) method for RNA pseudouridine site prediction (XG-PseU). Cross-validation scores for RNA pseudouridine site identification in the abovementioned three species showed the best accuracy for iPseU-CNN (66.9%) in <italic>H. sapiens</italic>, whereas XG-PseU and iPseU-CNN had the best accuracy (68.2%) in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and XG-PseU was the most accurate (72.0%) in <italic>M. musculus</italic>. According to independent testing scores, iPseU-CNN outperformed the other models, with 69.0% accuracy in <italic>H. sapiens</italic> and 73.6% accuracy in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Although the iPseU-CNN predictor had a high average cross-validation accuracy (68.9%) and independent testing accuracy (71.3%) scores, there was still room for improvement in comparison with some high-performing m6A site predictors (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">Zou et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
    <p>In this work, a model is developed based on the random forest algorithm, RF-PseU, for pseudouridine site recognition. The modeling overview is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. RF-PseU incorporates multiple sequence feature representation technologies, and the light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) algorithm is employed to remove redundant features and rank the remaining features. Evaluation with leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation demonstrated the robustness of the model. The average cross-validation accuracy (71.3% for 10-Fold and 71.4% for LOO) of RF-PseU was improved by 3.48–10.3% compared with existing state-of-the-art predictors, and the average independent testing accuracy (74.7%) showed a 4.8–19% increase. A user-friendly web server was also implemented, which can be accessed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://148.70.81.170:10228/rfpseu">http://148.70.81.170:10228/rfpseu</ext-link>. RF-PseU is expected to be a useful supplement to the existing tools for pseudouridine site identification.</p>

      <title>Data Sets</title>
      <p>Given that there were small differences between the benchmark data sets used in the studies of <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al.

The training data sets included data for three species. That is, <italic>H. sapiens</italic> training dataset with 495 psedouridine-sites-containing sequences and 495 non-psedouridine-sites-containing; <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> training dataset contains 314 psedouridine-sites-sequences and 314 non-psedouridine-sites-sequences; <italic>M. musculus</italic> training dataset consists of 944 sequences, half of which is positive samples. Whereas the independent testing data sets covered only two species, <italic>H. sapiens</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, both of which contain 100 positive samples and 100 negative samples. For the <italic>H. sapiens</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic> data sets, the window size was 21, i.e. the positive samples were psedouridine site centroid sequences of 21 base pairs each, whereas those for the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> samples window site was 31, with psedouridine site centroid sequences of 31 base pairs. Negative samples, in which no psedouridine sites were detected, consisted of 21 base pairs for <italic>H. sapiens</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic>, and 31 base pairs for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.

Generally, using Xmer k-spaced Ymer to encode an RNA sequence will generate a 4<sup>X</sup> × 4<sup>Y</sup> feature vector. In this study, X, Y, and k were set to 1, 2, or 3; and eight XYK combinations (except for 3mer-kspaced-3mer) were used for encoding. The PyFeat tool developed by Rafsanjani et al. (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Muhammod et al., 2019</xref>) was used to convert RNA sequences into vectors.</p>

Several feature selection technologies, including ANOVA (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Lv et al., 2019b</xref>) and MRMD (<xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">Zou et al., 2016</xref>), have been developed and are widely used for DNA, RNA, and protein identification (<xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2018b</xref>). In this work, an LGBM (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Ke et al., 2017</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="footnote1">1</xref></sup> wrapper was used to select appropriate feature spaces for model training. In this process, raw training data were fed into the LGBM model and their features were ranked by importance value as calculated with the LGBM algorithm. Features with importance values greater than the average were selected to compose the feature space for modeling.</p>

      <p>The proposed models were evaluated by five commonly used metrics, accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), Matthew correlation coefficient (MCC), and integral area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auROC). These metrics were calculated using the following equations, where TP, TN, FP, and FN stand for true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative, respectively (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2019b</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">c</xref>; <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2017d</xref>, <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">e</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2019a</xref>). For the ROC curve, 1-specificity was plotted on the horizontal axis, and sensitivity on the vertical axis.</p>

That is the general machine learning evaluation methods (training, validation and testing) are used for optimized model evaluation. To test the efficiency of the classification, LOO cross-validation was performed for a data set containing n items, of which n-1 items were used for training and the remaining one was used for validation. This procedure was repeated until every sequence in the training data set had been used once as a validation testing sample. LOO cross-validation is robust but time-consuming for a large data set. To compare the performance of the model with that of existing predictors, 10-Fold cross-validation was also used. The training data set was stochastically divided into 10 subsets, with one subset for validation and the remaining nine for training. This process was repeated 10 times and the average results were used to evaluate the model. Finally, independent testing was performed to obtain a data set that was completely distinct from the training data set for evaluation of the trained model.</p>

      <p>The random forest method is a bagging-type ensemble learning algorithm (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2018a</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). By combining multiple weak classifiers, the final results can be voted or averaged to obtain an overall model with higher accuracy, better general performance, and resistance to overfitting. This algorithm has been extensively used in bioinformatics and other areas, and has been confirmed to be an effective modeling technique in various domains (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2016a</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Mrozek et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2017a</xref>,<xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>,<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">c</xref>; <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">2019a</xref>; <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Xue et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Degenhardt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2019</xref>).

      <p>Support vector machine (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Cortes and Vapnik, 1995</xref>) is a generalized linear classifier that classifies data based on supervised learning; its decision boundary is the maximum-margin hyperplane required to solve the learning sample.

      <title>Optimization With Different Feature Spaces</title>
      <p>To determine optimal feature spaces, we first used the LGBM algorithm to sort the features from maximum to minimum according to their importance value. All the features with importance value greater than the average were kept. Second, we used an incremental feature selection strategy; as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, the 10-Fold cross-validation and independent testing accuracy varied as features were added. Initially, the accuracy increased rapidly for each species. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> (A1) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> (A2), when the feature dimensions for <italic>H. sapiens</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> reached 257 and 397, the model achieved maximum independent testing accuracies of 75.0 and 77.0%, respectively. Owing to the lack of independent test data sets for <italic>M. musculus</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> (A3) shows only the cross-validation accuracy curve, with its peak value (74.8%) at a feature dimension of 161. The optimal feature space dimensions selected for each species were 257, 397, and 161, respectively. These values were used for further experiments and optimization.</p>

In cross-validation (10-Fold and LOO) and testing process, the training datasets have divided into training part and validation part. That is, they have used the general machine learning evaluation methods (training, validation and testing) for model optimization. In the figure, the 10-fold cross-validation and LOO cross-validation metric values are obtained from the validation part of training part, while the independent testing metric values are obtained from the independent testing datasets.</p>

      <title>Comparison With SVM Predictors</title>
      <p>Given that PPUS (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2015b</xref>), iRNA-PseU (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), and PseUI (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2018</xref>) were all based on SVM, an optimized SVM model for pseudouridine site identification with the same feature spaces as the RF model was constructed to determine the effects of the SVM and RF on prediction performance. The performances of the two models are shown in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Overall, the models based on RF showed markedly better performance than those based on SVM. For instance, in terms of 10-Fold cross-validation accuracy, the RF models for <italic>H. sapiens</italic>, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and <italic>M. musculus</italic> outperformed the corresponding SVM models by 3.71%, 10.8%, and 5.80%, respectively. The independent testing accuracy scores showed an even greater contrast. For example, the RF model had 75.0% accuracy for <italic>H. sapiens</italic>, exactly 1.17 times that of the SVM model. The ROC curve and auROC value shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> also demonstrate that the optimized RF models performed better than the optimized SVM models for the same feature spaces. Thus, non-SVM models such as XG-PseU (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2019b</xref>), iPseU-CNN (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Tahir et al., 2019</xref>), and our RF-PseU model might be more suitable for distinguishing pseudouridine sites from non- pseudouridine sites.</p>

      <title>Comparison With Previous Predictors</title>
      <p>The performance of RF-PseU was also compared with that of state-of-the-art predictors including iRNA-PseU (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), PseUI (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2018</xref>), iPseU-CNN (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Tahir et al., 2019</xref>), and XG-PseU (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2019b</xref>). First, we compared the evaluation scores for the three species. <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> compares the cross-validation and independent testing scores for the state-of-the-art pseudouridine sites predictors with those of RF-PseU. In terms of cross-validation scores, the LOO accuracy values for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic> were 75.4% and 74.5%, respectively, representing increments of approximately 10.5% and 3.47% over the values for the existing predictor (XG-PseU) with the best cross-validation score. However, the LOO accuracy of RF-PseU for <italic>H. sapiens</italic>, at 64.0%, showed a decrease of 4.0% compared with the best <italic>H. sapiens</italic> pseudouridine site predictor, PseU-CNN. In terms of independent testing, as shown in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, RF-PseU scored higher than the existing predictors in all aspects. For comprehensive comparison, the average scores for different species were calculated. The results, shown in <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, demonstrate that RF-PseU performed better overall than the other four predictors. The cross-validation accuracy scores of RF-PseU were 3.48% higher than those of the best existing predictor, iPseU-CNN; in terms of independent testing scores, RF-PseU showed a marked improvement of 4.7–10.6% compared with iPseU-CNN. The overall performance of RF-PseU was also significantly better than those of the other predictors, indicating that RF-PseU can discriminate true pseudouridine sites from non-pseudouridine sites more precisely than the existing predictors.</p>

      <title>Web Server Implementation</title>
      <p>For convenience, a webserver with an easy-to-use interface was developed (see screenshot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), which can be accessed freely at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://148.70.81.170:10228/rfpseu">http://148.70.81.170:10228/rfpseu</ext-link>. A step-by-step user guide is given here. First, users select a species from the drop-down box and paste or type the query RNA sequences in FASTA format into the textbox. Second, after clicking the submit button, the query results will be shown in a table on the same page after a wait. Note that once a query task has been submitted, the submit button will be disabled. Third, the user can click the clear button to empty the input text box and enable the submit button, and return to step one to enter a new query task.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>In this study, a new model, named RF-PseU, for predicting RNA pseudouridine sites in multiple species is presented. For given feature spaces, the random forest algorithm was shown to be more efficient than SVM models for discriminating pseudouridine sites from non-pseudouridine sites. In terms of average cross-validation and independent testing accuracy scores, RF-PseU showed improvements of 3.6–10% and 4.8–21%, respectively, compared with state-of-the-art predictors. Moreover, a web server with a user-friendly interface is available. It is anticipated that RF-PseU will be a useful tool for RNA pseudouridine site analysis. However, the model requires further development via combination with other technologies before it is suitable for use as a classifier for RNA pseudouridine sites. Future work will explore emerging methods such as Gene2Vec (<xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">Zou et al., 2019</xref>), m6Acomet (<xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2019</xref>), and iterative feature representation (<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2019b</xref>) to improve the model’s performance.</p>
