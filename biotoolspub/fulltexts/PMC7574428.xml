        <title>Background</title>
        <p id="Par1">Repetitive sequences account for a large proportion of eukaryotes genomes. Identification of repetitive sequences plays a significant role in many applications, such as structural variation detection and genome assembly. Many existing de novo repeat identification pipelines or tools make use of assembly of the high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic> to obtain repeats. However, a certain degree of sequence coverage is required for assemblers to get the desired assemblies. On the other hand, assemblers cut the reads into shorter <italic>k-mers</italic> for assembly, which may destroy the structure of the repetitive regions. For the above reasons, it is difficult to obtain complete and accurate repetitive regions in the genome by using existing tools.</p>

        <title>Results</title>
        <p id="Par2">In this study, we present a new method called RepAHR for de novo repeat identification by assembly of the high-frequency reads. Firstly, RepAHR scans next-generation sequencing (NGS) reads to find the high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic>. Secondly, RepAHR filters the high-frequency reads from whole NGS reads according to certain rules based on the high-frequency <italic>k-mer</italic>. Finally, the high-frequency reads are assembled to generate repeats by using SPAdes, which is considered as an outstanding genome assembler with NGS sequences.</p>

    <title>Background</title>
    <p id="Par9">The repetitive sequences are patterns of nucleic acids, which occur multiple times in genome with the same or approximate form. Based on their structure and distribution in the genome, repetitive sequences are classified into several types, i.e. tandem repeats, interspersed repeats and so on. Tandem repeats consists of repetitive elements adjacent to each other and they are categorized into satellites, minisatellites and microsatellites based on their repetitive element size and repetitive level. Interspersed repeats are dispersed throughout the genome and mainly composed of transposable elements (TEs). Transposable elements account for a large fraction of the genome and have influence on much of the mass of DNA in eukaryotic genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In many organisms, repeated sequences make up a significant part of whole genomes, e.g. over two-thirds of the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], over 75% of the maize genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and about 20% of the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] are repetitive. For many basic analysis methods of genome sequences, such as de novo assembly, sequence alignment, sequence error correction, etc., repetitive sequences pose a challenge to these tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par10">In recent years, many methods have been proposed with the developments and applications of the high-throughput sequencing and single molecule sequencing. Tallymer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] counts <italic>k-mer</italic> occurrences from sequence sets and puts <italic>k-mer</italic> into enhanced suffix arrays to find repetitive sequences. RepeatExplorer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] is a collection of software tools with a web interface and utilizes a graph-based sequence clustering algorithm to facilitate de novo repeat identification. RepARK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] creates repeat libraries from NGS reads by assembly of the high-frequency <italic>k-mer</italic> without using a reference genome, which has two working modes based on the assembly tools, RepARK Velvet and RepARK CLC. MixTaR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] firstly detects raw tandem repeat patterns from short reads, then selects out long reads containing raw tandem repeat patterns, and finally regards the assembly of the short reads which overlap long reads as TR repeats. RepLong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] creates a read overlap network and uses community detection algorithm to detect long repeats by using only Pacbio long reads. REPdenovo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] counts <italic>k-mer</italic> frequency and assembles <italic>k-mer</italic> into raw contigs, then merges contigs from directed contig graph into scaffolds to obtain repeats. The <italic>k-mer</italic> frequency is typically calculated from the NGS reads and the repeats are obtained by assembly of the high frequency <italic>k-mers</italic>. For example, RepARK and REPdenovo are both methods based on this principle. However, these approaches have some drawbacks.</p>
    <p id="Par11">Firstly, the higher sequence coverage is a requirement for common assemblers to work properly. For example, EPGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] ,EPGA2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and SPAdes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] usually require read coverage of more than 30<inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Compared with other sequence assemblers, SPAdes uses multiple <italic>de Bruijn</italic> graphs to construct contigs. This strategy can effectively reduce assembly errors while making full use of a variety of <italic>k-mers</italic> of different sizes to build more complete assemblies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Due to the dual effects of sequencing bias and the complexity of the repetitive region structure, the fragment can be repeated from several times to serval thousand times. For <italic>k-mers</italic> converted from fragments with a large number of repetitions, their frequencies usually much higher than the average coverage of sequencing, and for others with few repetitions may not meet the basic coverage requirement. Therefore, the repetitive fragments with low repeatability are difficult to obtain by assembly, and the integrity of the test results is greatly affected.</p>
    <p id="Par12">Secondly, most of the widely-used NGS assemblers are designed based on the paired-end reads, which often resolve the branch path resulting from the repetitive region by using paired-end reads of large insertsizes. However, the length of the high frequency <italic>k-mers</italic> is too short compared with the reads, which is detrimental to the recovery of the repetitive segments. In addition, splitting reads into <italic>k-mers</italic> may destroy the structure of the repetitive regions, which means that assemblers do not perform well under such conditions.</p>
    <p id="Par13">Finally, due to the length of the <italic>k-mer</italic> is short, the sequencing error has a great influence on the result of the <italic>k-mer</italic> frequency counting. Assembly of <italic>k-mers</italic> may bring the sequencing errors within these <italic>k-mers</italic> into repeats, resulting the accuracy of the repetitive regions decreases. In this study, a method called RepAHR is proposed to overcome the shortcomings mentioned above and get more accurate repeats. Compared the repeats identified by RepAHR with these of RepARK and REPdenovo on five NGS datasets, the experimental results show that RepAHR outperforms RepARK Velvet, RepARK CLC and REPdenovo in some aspects.</p>

      <title>Metrics for evaluation</title>
      <p id="Par14">In order to comprehensively evaluate the performance of each tool, we use seventeen evaluation metrics in this experiment, which are Num, Max (bp), Min (bp), N50 (bp), N90 (bp), Avg_length (bp), AR (%), Alignment ratio (%), Multiple alignment ratio (%), Masked ratios on reference genome (%), Masked ratios on RepBase sequences (%), User Time (s), System Time (s), Percent of CPU this job got (%), Maximum resident set size (kbytes), Virtual Memory (kb) and File system outputs. Among them, ’Num’ denotes the number of segments in detection results, ’Max (kb)’ denotes the length of the largest segment in detection results, ’N50 (kb)’ is the length of the longest segment such that all the segments longer than this segment cover at least half (50%) of the total length of all segments, ’N90’ are calculated in a similar way, ’Avg_length (bp)’ denotes the average length of segments, ’AR (%)’ denotes alignment ratio of the high-frequency <italic>k-mer</italic> or the high frequency reads on RepBase sequences, ’Alignment ratio (%)’ is the proportion of fragments in the detected results that can be aligned to the reference genome, ’Multiple alignment ratio (%)’ is the proportion of fragments in the detection results that can be aligned to multiple locations on the reference genome, ’Masked ratios on reference genome (%)’ is the proportion of bases on the reference genome that can be covered by the detection results, ’Masked ratios on RepBase sequences (%)’ is the proportion of bases in RepBase that can be covered by the detection results, ’Virtual Memory (kb)’ indicates the peak virtual memory consumption of algorithms.
</p>
      <p id="Par15">We evaluate the repeats identified by RepAHR, RepARK and REPdenovo on five NGS data sets. Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the comparison of the repeats identified by RepAHR, RepARK and REPdenovo in terms of number of repeats, total bases number of repeats, N50 and length of repeats. REPdenovo can identify few repeats and its bases number is the least among the four methods, but the average length of its repeats is the longest. RepARK CLC identifies more repeats and bases number than REPdenovo, but repeats identified by RepARK CLC are shorter than repeats identified by REPdenovo. Compared with the other three tools, RepARK Velvet can identify more repeats, but the bases number of its repeats is less than RepAHR in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Homo sapiens chr14</italic> and <italic>Mus musculus</italic>. The repeats identified by RepARK Velvet have the shortest average length, which can be seen from the N50 and N90. RepAHR identifies fewer repeats than RepARK Velvet, but the size of repeats identified by RepAHR is larger than that obtained by RepARK Velvet. In terms of sequence length, the maximum repeat length identified by RepAHR is the longest of the four methods, but it can be seen from the N50 and N90 that the repeats identified by RepAHR also contains many short fragments. The long and short fragments combined together make the final repeats identified by RepAHR more complete.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Metrics of repeats on five datasets</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Species</th><th align="left">Method</th><th align="left">Num</th><th align="left">Size (kbp)</th><th align="left">Max/min</th><th align="left">N50 (bp)</th><th align="left">N90 (bp)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="4"><italic>Drosophila</italic><italic>melanogaster</italic></td><td align="left">RepARK CLC</td><td char="." align="char">818</td><td align="left">518</td><td char="." align="char">6833/200</td><td char="." align="char">1040</td><td char="." align="char">255</td></tr><tr><td align="left">RepARK Velvet</td><td char="." align="char">4561</td><td align="left">873</td><td char="." align="char">7587/57</td><td char="." align="char">285</td><td char="." align="char">87</td></tr><tr><td align="left">REPdenovo</td><td char="." align="char">52</td><td align="left">61</td><td char="." align="char">8339/102</td><td char="." align="char">2843</td><td char="." align="char">397</td></tr><tr><td align="left">RepAHR</td><td char="." align="char">2647</td><td align="left">1350</td><td char="." align="char">12,787/56</td><td char="." align="char">1350</td><td char="." align="char">98</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="4"><italic>Saccharomyces</italic><italic>cerevisiae</italic></td><td align="left">RepARK CLC</td><td char="." align="char">545</td><td align="left">291</td><td char="." align="char">8271/200</td><td char="." align="char">626</td><td char="." align="char">266</td></tr><tr><td align="left">RepARK Velvet</td><td char="." align="char">1457</td><td align="left">394</td><td char="." align="char">9129/57</td><td char="." align="char">423</td><td char="." align="char">111</td></tr><tr><td align="left">REPdenovo</td><td char="." align="char">3</td><td align="left">0.72</td><td char="." align="char">265/213</td><td char="." align="char">258</td><td char="." align="char">213</td></tr><tr><td align="left">RepAHR</td><td char="." align="char">392</td><td align="left">219</td><td char="." align="char">9523/128</td><td char="." align="char">2089</td><td char="." align="char">183</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="4"><italic>Acromyrmex</italic><italic>echinatior</italic></td><td align="left">RepARK CLC</td><td char="." align="char">485</td><td align="left">249</td><td char="." align="char">8272/200</td><td char="." align="char">659</td><td char="." align="char">240</td></tr><tr><td align="left">RepARK Velvet</td><td char="." align="char">3931</td><td align="left">559</td><td char="." align="char">5547/57</td><td char="." align="char">160</td><td char="." align="char">68</td></tr><tr><td align="left">REPdenovo</td><td char="." align="char">249</td><td align="left">99</td><td char="." align="char">2143/100</td><td char="." align="char">597</td><td char="." align="char">182</td></tr><tr><td align="left">RepAHR</td><td char="." align="char">2699</td><td align="left">514</td><td char="." align="char">10,701/88</td><td char="." align="char">285</td><td char="." align="char">86</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="4"><inline-formula id="IEq2"><alternatives><tex-math id="M3">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <title>The high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic> and reads</title>
      <p id="Par16">Among RepAHR, RepARK Velvet, RepARK CLC and REPdenovo, the most obvious difference between RepAHR and the other three methods is that RepAHR does not directly use the high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic> for sequence assembly. RepAHR first uses the high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic> to find the high-frequency reads, then assembles the high-frequency reads to obtain repeats. In order to prove that the high-frequency reads have some advantages over the high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic>, we compare the high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic> and the high-frequency reads in experiments.</p>
      <p id="Par17">Repbase is the most widely-used database of repetitive DNA sequences in which the currently known repetitive DNA sequences of many eukaryotes are stored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The similarity between a sequence and the sequences in Repbase can be used as a criterion for determining whether the sequence is a repetitive sequence. In the test, three NGS datasets (<italic>D.mela</italic>, <italic>M.musc</italic> and <italic>H.sapi</italic>) are used to obtain the high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic>, and the high-frequency reads are selected by RepAHR from all reads according to the high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic>. RepARK, REPdenovo and RepAHR differ in the method of determining the high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic> threshold. In our test, the high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic> is obtained using the high-frequency threshold of RepARK. The high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic> and reads separated from three datasets (<italic>D.mela</italic>, <italic>M.musc</italic> and <italic>H.sapi</italic>) are aligned to the corresponding Repbase library for each species, respectively. The aligned sequences with overlaps are connected together to form a long segment called alignment segment.</p>
      <p id="Par18">The comparison of the number, N50, the average length and the maximum length of aligned segments obtained based on the high-frequency k-mers and reads is shown in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. N50 is the length of the longest contig such that all the contigs longer than this contig cover at least half of the genome being assembled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In addition, the alignment ratios of the high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic> and reads compared with the Repbase are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. In Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, the alignment ratios of the high-frequency reads are much higher than the alignment ratios of the high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic>. It also can been seen that the number of aligned segments obtained by the high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic> is much larger than that obtained by the high-frequency reads in three species. At the same time, the length of the alignment segments obtained by the high-frequency reads is greater than that obtained by the high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic>, which can be seen from the variation of the N50 and the average length of detection results in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. The maximum length of the aligned segments covered by the high-frequency reads is the same as the <italic>k-mers</italic>. This shows that the high-frequency reads and <italic>k-mers</italic> are similar in covering the long alignment segments. As can be seen from Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, the total number of alignment segments obtained by the high-frequency reads is less than that obtained by the high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic>, but the number of alignment segments obtained by the high-frequency reads is greater than that obtained by the high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic> in the long length portion. It can be inferred that the short alignment segments obtained by the high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic> are formed by gaps in which continuous regions cannot be communicated. The visualization tool IGV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] is used to demonstrate the alignment of the high-frequency reads and <italic>k-mers</italic> with Repbase sequences. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the case where the sequence named BATUM_I in the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Repbase library is covered by the high-frequency reads and <italic>k-mers</italic>. There is a gap on the region that is not covered by the high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic>, while this region is completely covered by the high-frequency reads, which proves that the high-frequency reads is easier to obtain a complete repeat region.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>A visual example of the alignment of the high frequency <italic>k-mers</italic> and the high frequency reads with the segments in Repbase library</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12859_2020_3779_Fig1_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig><table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Metrics of alignment segments</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Species</th><th align="left">Segment type</th><th align="left">Num</th><th align="left">N50 (bp)</th><th align="left">Avg length (bp)</th><th align="left">Max (bp)</th><th align="left">AR (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2"><italic>Drosophila</italic><italic>melanogaster</italic></td><td align="left">High-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic></td><td char="." align="char">4105</td><td char="." align="char">1291</td><td char="." align="char">187.36</td><td char="." align="char">8256</td><td char="." align="char">58.90</td></tr><tr><td align="left">High-frequency reads</td><td char="." align="char">1336</td><td char="." align="char">3336</td><td char="." align="char">542.81</td><td char="." align="char">8256</td><td char="." align="char">80.55</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2"><italic>Mus</italic><italic>musculus</italic></td><td align="left">High-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic></td><td char="." align="char">2612</td><td char="." align="char">1142</td><td char="." align="char">262.49</td><td char="." align="char">7673</td><td char="." align="char">24.73</td></tr><tr><td align="left">High-frequency reads</td><td char="." align="char">421</td><td char="." align="char">5943</td><td char="." align="char">1203.55</td><td char="." align="char">7673</td><td char="." align="char">82.64</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2"><inline-formula id="IEq9"><alternatives><tex-math id="M17">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <p id="Par19">Based on the above results and analysis, it can be considered that the high-frequency reads is longer, more continuous, and more accurate than the high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic>, and it is more suitable for obtaining repeats by sequence assembly. Compared with the previous two methods, RepAHR not only replaces the high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic> with the high-frequency reads, but also preserves the information of the paired-end reads as much as possible to assist in the assembly of repetitive regions. It is well known that the paired-end reads can span hundreds to thousands of bp (base pair), so using its supporting information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], RepAHR can assemble and identify longer repetitive regions.

      <title>Verification of the authenticity of repeated sequences detected by RepAHR</title>
      <p id="Par20">In order to prove that the repeats recognized by RepAHR are not only long , but also are the true repeats in the genome. We take a special repetitive region detected by three tools on dataset of human-r14 as an example to analyze, just as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. In Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, the first block shows the alignment relationships between the repetitive fragments detected by RepARK and the reference genome, the second block shows the alignment relationships between the repetitive fragments detected by REPdenovo and the reference genome, and the third block shows the alignment relationships between the repetitive fragments detected by RepAHR and the reference genome. From Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, we can find that the repetitive fragment detected by RepAHR is more complete than that obtained by RepARK, and there is no fragment detected by REPdenovo in this region. Therefore, RepAHR obtains the longest and the most complete repetitive fragment in this region. Next, we need to prove whether the repetitive fragment obtained by RepAHR is real. In order to achieve the purpose of verification, we collected the repeated fragments obtained by different tools in this region, and aligned them to the human-r14 reference sequence by using the bowtie2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] aligner. The alignment results show that the repetitive fragment detected by RepAHR can be aligned to different locations on the human-r14 reference sequence, and its coverage regions include the coverage regions of the RepARK’s detection results. The sequence fragment detected by RepAHR is not only a true repeat in the genome, but also the longest and most complete fragment in the detection results of three tools.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>A special repetitive region on the human-r14 genome is covered by the detection results of each tools.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12859_2020_3779_Fig2_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par21">In order to prove that the repetitive regions detected by RepAHR which cannot or cannot fully be identified by other tools, we compared the repetitive regions detected by the three tools on the human-r14 dataset. The benchmark for comparison is the repetitive regions on the human-r14 dataset provided by a third-party library, and the comparison results are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. From Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, we find that RepAHR can detect some specific regions that other tools cannot identify or cannot fully identify. In this step, Bowtie2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] is used as a aligner.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>An practical example of the alignment of fragments obtained by different tools and the human-r14 reference sequence</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12859_2020_3779_Fig3_HTML" id="MO6"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par22">In order to verify the influence of read coverage on the detection effect of each tools, we designed a simulation experiment based on the human-r14 reference sequence. The specific process of the simulation experiment is as follows: Firstly, four sets of simulation sequencing libraries with different coverage are generated by ART (an NGS read simulator) using the human-r14 reference sequence as the template. Secondly, we have tested the three tools on four simulated sequencing libraries, and the test results are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> The average read coverage represents the average sequencing depth at each regions of the genome, which reflects the sequencing level of the entire genome. From Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, we can see that the average read coverage have a certain influence on the detection results of each tools. From the overall trend, the max length and N50 of the fragments in the test results increases as the average coverage of the reads increases. The main reason for this phenomenon is that the sequence assembly process is extremely susceptible to changes in read coverage. For example, Velvet, SOAPdenovo2, Abyss, IDBA and SPAdes usually require read coverage of more than 30X to meet the basic requirements of assembly, otherwise the assemblies will be very fragmented. From the experimental results shown in Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, we can find that the impact of read coverage on the detection results of tools is inevitable, and this impact is not specific to RepAHR, but also to these two similar tools.<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>The influence of read coverage on the detection effect of each tools</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Species</th><th align="left">Method</th><th align="left">Cov/read_len (bp)</th><th align="left">Num</th><th align="left">MA_ratio (%)</th><th align="left">Max/min</th><th align="left">N50 (bp)</th><th align="left">N90 (bp)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="12"><inline-formula id="IEq19"><alternatives><tex-math id="M37">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <p id="Par23">Generally, there is a certain conversion relationship (just as shown in equation (2) of the main text) between the average coverage of reads and the frequency of <italic>k-mers</italic> converted from these reads. Therefore, we can obtain the average read coverage by using the <italic>k-mer</italic> frequency distribution information, and we can also obtain the high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic> and the high-frequency reads in the global genome based on the average read coverage. From a global perspective, assuming that the sequencing is roughly balanced, the high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic> must be from the repetitive regions. Therefore, the reads containing more the high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic> must also from the repetitive regions. The conclusion is that as long as the high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic> contained in a read reaches a certain proportion, this read must be included in RepAHR without being missed. On the contrary, the reads missed by RepAHR must be those that do not meet the above requirements. We are not sure whether they come from the repetitive regions.</p>

      <p id="Par25">In the experiment, Bowtie2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] is used as a aligner to obtain the overall and the multiple alignment ratios between the repeats and their respective reference sequences on the five data sets. The overall alignment ratio refers to the ratio of the number of repeats that can be aligned to the reference genome at least one position to the total number of repeats. The multiple alignment ratio refers to the ratio of the number of repeats that can be aligned to the reference genome multiple positions to the total number of repeats.</p>
      <p id="Par26">As can be seen from Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, RepAHR gets the higher multiple alignment ratios than the other three methods on the five data sets. In particular, RepAHR has obvious advantages in the multiple alignment ratio on <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> dataset. The experimental results show that the repeats identified by RepAHR are more repetitive and accurate than the other three methods. As can be seen from Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>, the proportion of repeats identified by RepAHR can be aligned with multiple positions of the reference genome is higher than the other tools. For example, Bowtie2 is used to align repeats identified by RepAHR to the reference genome of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. The alignment results show that more than half of these repeats can be aligned to more than 100 positions of the reference genome, just as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Alignment ratios and multiple alignment ratios of repeats which generated from four tools on five different datasets. ‘Alignment ratios(%)’ is the proportion of fragments in the detected results that can be aligned to the reference genome, and ‘Multiple alignment ratios(%)’ is the proportion of fragments in the detected results that can be aligned to multiple locations on the reference genome</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12859_2020_3779_Fig4_HTML" id="MO7"/></fig><fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>The frequency distribution of segments in detected results generated from RepAHR on dataset of Drosophila melanogaster</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12859_2020_3779_Fig5_HTML" id="MO8"/></fig><table-wrap id="Tab6"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Alignment ratios and multiple alignment ratios of repeats on five data sets</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Species</th><th align="left">Method</th><th align="left">Num</th><th align="left">Alignment                ratio (%)</th><th align="left">Multiple alignment          ratio (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="4"><italic>Drosophila</italic><italic>melanogaster</italic></td><td align="left">RepARK CLC</td><td char="." align="char">818</td><td char="." align="char">97.43</td><td char="." align="char">92.42</td></tr><tr><td align="left">RepARK Velvet</td><td char="." align="char">4561</td><td char="." align="char">99.28</td><td char="." align="char">94.04</td></tr><tr><td align="left">REPdenovo</td><td char="." align="char">52</td><td char="." align="char">88.46</td><td char="." align="char">86.54</td></tr><tr><td align="left">RepAHR</td><td char="." align="char">2647</td><td char="." align="char">97.96</td><td char="." align="char">95.35</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="4"><italic>Saccharomyces</italic><italic>cerevisiae</italic></td><td align="left">RepARK CLC</td><td char="." align="char">545</td><td char="." align="char">97.42</td><td char="." align="char">25.32</td></tr><tr><td align="left">RepARK Velvet</td><td char="." align="char">1457</td><td char="." align="char">98.76</td><td char="." align="char">41.39</td></tr><tr><td align="left">REPdenovo</td><td char="." align="char">3</td><td char="." align="char">100.0</td><td char="." align="char">33.33</td></tr><tr><td align="left">RepAHR</td><td char="." align="char">392</td><td char="." align="char">97.70</td><td char="." align="char">90.56</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="4"><italic>Acromyrmex</italic><italic>echinatior</italic></td><td align="left">RepARK CLC</td><td char="." align="char">485</td><td char="." align="char">84.95</td><td char="." align="char">69.69</td></tr><tr><td align="left">RepARK Velvet</td><td char="." align="char">3931</td><td char="." align="char">93.64</td><td char="." align="char">87.75</td></tr><tr><td align="left">REPdenovo</td><td char="." align="char">249</td><td char="." align="char">65.46</td><td char="." align="char">61.45</td></tr><tr><td align="left">RepAHR</td><td char="." align="char">2699</td><td char="." align="char">94.89</td><td char="." align="char">89.14</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="4"><inline-formula id="IEq33"><alternatives><tex-math id="M65">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <p id="Par28">Repbase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] is the most commonly used database of repetitive DNA sequences. In this study, we use RepeatMakser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] to compute the ratio of bases in Repbase library that can be covered by detection results of tools. As can be seen from Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, the masked ratio of RepAHR is higher than that of RepARK CLC, RepARK Velvet and REPdenovo. It is indicated that the repeats identified by RepAHR is closer to the repeats collected in the Repbase database. Therefore, the repeats identified by RepAHR is more accurate and reliable.

There are two strategies used to perform the alignment of the repeats identified by each tools with the corresponding Repbase library, which indicate that the fragments in Repbase library can be covered by the single alignment repeats and multiple alignment repeats, respectively. The coverage ratios obtained by using these two strategies are called the best coverage ratio and maximum coverage ratio, which can be abbreviated as BCR and MCR, respectively.

      <p id="Par30">Figure <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> shows the distribution of the coverage ratio obtained from the four methods by using the BLAST. Each box shows the range of 50% in the middle, and the horizontal line in the box represents the median of the coverage ratios, the x marked in the box indicates the mean of the coverage ratios. Figure <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a shows the distribution of BCR on the Repbase sequences. As can be seen from this figure,the BCR of the repeats identified by RepAHR is higher than that of the other three methods. This is manifested that the median, mean, and upper quartile and lower quartile of the repeats generated from RepAHR are greater than that of the other three methods. Similarly, the distribution of MCR on the Repbase sequences is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>b. The upper quartile of the repeats generated from RepAHR is close to 100%, which means that more than 25% of the Repbase sequences are 100% covered by the repeats identified by RepAHR. In addition, the median, mean, and lower quartiles of the repeats generated from RepAHR are higher than those obtained from the other three methods. It is indicated that the repetitive sequences identified by RepAHR are more similar to the repeats in Repbase, and also closer to the standard repetitive sequences.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Distribution of BLAST coverage ratios on Repbase sequences.

      <p id="Par31">From the data shown in Tables <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> and <xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref>, we can see that RepAHR has problems with long running time and large memory requirements on some datasets (such as <italic>Acromyrmex echinatior</italic> and <italic>Musmusculus</italic>). Those problems have caused our great concern. To confirm this problem, we retested the CPU time and virtual memory consumption of the three tools on five datasets. Now we summarize the test conclusions as follows: (1) when <italic>RepAHR</italic> uses the default parameters to process some datasets (such as <italic>Acromyrmex echinatior</italic> and <italic>Musmusculus</italic>), it does have the disadvantages of long calculation time and large memory demand. The comparison of CPU time and virtual memory consumption of these three tools when using default parameters to process these five datasets is shown in Table <xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="table">9</xref>; (2) through the analysis, we find that there are two important parameters in <italic>RepAHR</italic> (<italic>MAX_MEMORY</italic> and <italic>THREAD</italic>) that affect the running time and memory consumption. The statistics of the limit effect of the parameter of <italic>MAX_MEMORY</italic> on the memory usage of <italic>RepAHR</italic> when processing the Human-r14 dataset is shown in Table <xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="table">9</xref>. The statistics of the impact of concurrency on the memory usage of <italic>RepAHR</italic> when processing the <italic>Human-r14</italic> dataset is shown in Table <xref rid="Tab10" ref-type="table">10</xref>. As can be seen from the results shown in Table <xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="table">9</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab10" ref-type="table">10</xref>, when we lower the values of the two parameters <italic>MAX_MEMORY</italic> and <italic>THREAD</italic>, the memory requirements of the <italic>RepAHR</italic> will be greatly reduced. In addition, the running time of <italic>RepAHR</italic> can also be similar to the other two tools, especially when <italic>MAX_MEMORY</italic> and <italic>THREAD</italic> are set to 20 respectively, just as the shown in Table <xref rid="Tab11" ref-type="table">11</xref>; (3) the causes of the above phenomenon are analyzed. First, the parameter <italic>THREAD</italic> is used to set the number of threads when the program runs in parallel. In theory, the more threads, the shorter computing time, and the higher computing cost. When we reduce the number of threads, we will get the opposite conclusion (the memory cost is reduced, and the running time is longer). However, this statement is only theoretical. In fact, it is not necessary to increase the thread to improve the computing speed. This is because if the number of threads is set too much, it will intensify the competition of system resources and increase the delay of queuing. So in this case, when we appropriately reduce the number of threads, the memory consumption of the algorithm will be reduced on a large scale, and the calculation time of the algorithm will not be greatly affected. Second, the parameter <italic>MAX_MEMORY</italic> is used to set the maximum memory usage of the algorithm. When we reduce the value of this parameter, the operation system will control the amount of memory that the algorithm resides within the set <italic>MAX_MEMORY</italic> range. At this time, the program needs to deal with the limitations of the operation system through page scheduling. Therefore, when we reduce the value of this parameter, the memory consumption of the algorithm will be controlled, but the running speed of the algorithm will also be affected.<table-wrap id="Tab8"><label>Table 8</label><caption><p>The comparison of CPU time and virtual memory consumption of these three tools when using default parameters to process these five datasets</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Species</th><th align="left">RepARK [CPU time (s)/virtual memory (kb)]</th><th align="left">REPdenovo [CPU time (s)/virtual memory (kb)]</th><th align="left">RepAHR [CPU time (s)/virtual memory (kb)]</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Drosophila melanogaster</td><td align="left">1387.63/9,546,368</td><td align="left">4,896.98/13,223,216</td><td align="left">4441.25/11,333,456</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</td><td align="left">770.96/4,887,024</td><td align="left">12,846.08/48,140,200</td><td align="left">2,429.36/4,921,672</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Acromyrmex echinatior</td><td align="left">3198.22/18,730,776</td><td align="left">18,747.07/25,592,284</td><td align="left">20,245.73/20,513,324</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Human chr14</td><td align="left">1313.54/4887,452</td><td align="left">6,397.10/5,878,436</td><td align="left">4,354.44/24,886,024</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Musmusculus</td><td align="left">9654.50/37,149,572</td><td align="left">52,624.49/133,352,464</td><td align="left">606,338.15/2,608,150,044</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="Tab9"><label>Table 9</label><caption><p>Statistics of the limit effect of the perameter of <italic>MAX_MEMORY</italic> on the memory usage of <italic>RepAHR</italic> when processing the <italic>Human-r14</italic> dataset</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Species</th><th align="left">Method</th><th align="left"><italic>MAX_MEMORY</italic></th><th align="left">CPU time (s)</th><th align="left">Virtual memory (kb)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3"><inline-formula id="IEq37"><alternatives><tex-math id="M77">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <title>Recommendations on the parameters configuration of the proposed tool when resources are limited</title>
      <p id="Par32">Sequence assembly is the most time-consuming and memory-consuming step in the entire processing flow of RepAHR. Therefore, as long as the running time and memory consumption of this step can be controlled by adjusting the parameters <italic>MAX_MEMORY</italic> and <italic>THREADS</italic>, the tool can still run normally under the condition of limited resources. SPAdes uses 512 Mb per thread for buffers, which results in higher memory consumption (The default value of parameters <italic>MAX_MEMORY</italic> and <italic>THREADS</italic> in SPAdes are set to 250GB and 16 respectively). If you set memory limit manually, SPAdes will use smaller buffers and thus less RAM. The parameter <italic>MAX_MEMORY</italic> set memory limit in Gb. SPAdes terminates if it reaches this limit. Actual amount of consumed RAM will be below this limit. Make sure this value is correct for the given machine. SPAdes uses the limit value to automatically determine the sizes of various buffers, etc. The parameter <italic>THREADS</italic> is used to set the number of threads using in SPAdes assembly, and the default value of it is 16. The larger the number of threads is, the faster the SPAdes assembly speed, and the memory consumption will also increase.</p>
      <p id="Par33">Therefore, the value of the parameter <italic>MAX_MEMORY</italic> should be set according to the available memory capacity of the machine. For example, if the available memory of the machine is 300GB, then <italic>MAX_MEMORY</italic> can be set to 250GB at most. It should be noted that SPAdes assembly usually has the minimum memory requirements. For example, when the machine’s available memory are less than 20GB, the tool will report an error. In summary, the value of <italic>MAX_MEMORY</italic> should be taken in the interval [20, available_memory], and the number of threads should be calculated based on the actual processing speed requirements and the overall memory limit.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p id="Par34">In molecular biology, it is important to accurately detect repeats in the DNA sequences. With the development of the next-generation sequencing, more and more tools have been proposed for identification of repeats, including RepARK and REPdenovo. In this paper, we present a new method called RepAHR for de novo repeat identification by assembly of the high-frequency reads. The core steps of RepAHR are as follows: Firstly, RepAHR filters the high-frequency reads from overall NGS data according to certain rules based on the high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic>. Secondly, it identifies repeats by assembly of the high-frequency reads. The main advantages of RepAHR are reflected in the following two aspects:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par35">the high-frequency reads achieve enough coverage and longer than the <italic>k-mers</italic>, which facilitates the assembly process. Compared with the previous two methods, RepAHR not only replaces the high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic> with the high-frequency reads, but also preserves the information of the paired-end reads as much as possible to assist in the assembly of repetitive sequences. It is well known that the paired-end reads can span hundreds to thousands of bp (base pair), so using its supporting information, RepAHR can assemble and identify longer repetitive regions.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par36">due to the sequencing errors and bias, the <italic>k-mers</italic> from the repetitive regions do not necessarily all show high frequencies, and the <italic>k-mers</italic> with low frequencies are not necessarily all from the non-repetitive regions. In addition, in the case of a short <italic>k-mer</italic> size, the error <italic>k-mers</italic> also have the opportunity to couple together and behave as high frequencies. In these cases, it is unreliable to obtain repeating regions directly by assembly of the high-frequency <italic>k-mers</italic>. However, the strategy based on the high-frequency reads assembly can effectively circumvent this problem. Firstly, RepAHR has set a stricter filtering strategy in the process of selecting the high-frequency reads, which makes it less likely that error <italic>k-mers</italic> are used to form repetitive fragments. Secondly, RepAHR also set multiple verification strategies in the process of finalizing the repetitive fragments to ensure that the detection results are authentic and reliable.</p></list-item></list></p>
    <p id="Par37">The comparison of the repeats identified by RepAHR, RepARK CLC, RepARK Velvet and REPdenovo based on the five NGS datasets. We use multiple metrics, including some basic metrics of the repeats, alignment rate on reference genome, masked ratio on RepBase and so on, to evaluate the performance of each tools. The experimental results show that repeats obtained by RepAHR are more precise and reliable than that of RepARK CLC, RepARK Velvet and REPdenovo.</p>

    <title>Methods</title>
    <p id="Par38">As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>, the proposed method(RepAHR) contains the following phases. Firstly, RepAHR convents overall NGS short paired-end reads into unique <italic>k-mers</italic> and gets their frequencies by using Jellyfish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Secondly, RepAHR needs to determine whether the average read coverage is known. If it is known, its value can be used to calculate the threshold of the high frequency <italic>k-mer</italic> directly. Otherwise, RepAHR needs to estimate it based on the <italic>k-mer</italic> frequency distribution. Thirdly, RepAHR generates a high-frequency <italic>k-mer</italic> set based on overall <italic>k-mers</italic> and the high frequency threshold. Fourthly, RepAHR obtains the high-frequency reads from whole NGS short paired-end reads based on the high-frequency <italic>k-mer</italic> set. Finally, RepAHR gets assemblies of the high-frequency reads, and then scans these contigs to obtain the final repeats.

In this step, RepAHR needs to generate two groups of <italic>k-mers</italic> with different lengths by using Jellyfish. The <italic>k-mer</italic> length in the first group is about 15bp–20bp according to the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], while the second group is set to 31 bp which is an empirical value obtained through a lot of experiments.</p>
