    <abstract>
      <p>Biological networks, such as genetic regulatory networks, often contain positive and negative feedback loops that settle down to dynamically stable patterns. Identifying these patterns, the so-called attractors, can provide important insights for biologists to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying many coordinated cellular processes such as cellular division, differentiation, and homeostasis. Both synchronous and asynchronous Boolean networks have been used to simulate genetic regulatory networks and identify their attractors. The common methods of computing attractors are that start with a randomly selected initial state and finish with exhaustive search of the state space of a network. However, the time complexity of these methods grows exponentially with respect to the number and length of attractors. Here, we build two algorithms to achieve the computation of attractors in synchronous and asynchronous Boolean networks. For the synchronous scenario, combing with iterative methods and reduced order binary decision diagrams (ROBDD), we propose an improved algorithm to compute attractors. For another algorithm, the attractors of synchronous Boolean networks are utilized in asynchronous Boolean translation functions to derive attractors of asynchronous scenario. The proposed algorithms are implemented in a procedure called <italic>geneFAtt</italic>. Compared to existing tools such as <italic>genYsis</italic>, <italic>geneFAtt</italic> is significantly <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e001.jpg"/></inline-formula> faster in computing attractors for empirical experimental systems.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Biological networks contribute a mathematical analysis of connections found in ecological, evolutionary, and physiological studies, such as genetic regulatory networks <xref rid="pone.0060593-Proulx1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Pursuit for the nature of these networks is the central problem for biologists <xref rid="pone.0060593-Basso1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0060593-Hirose1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In the past decades, a wide variety of research has focused on modeling genetic regulatory networks using Boolean networks and search for their attractors <xref rid="pone.0060593-Glass1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0060593-Garg1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Computing the attractors in the Boolean networks is critical in understanding corresponding genetic regulatory networks and coordinated cellular processes such as cell cycle and cell differentiation in living organisms <xref rid="pone.0060593-Kauffman1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060593-Davidich1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In classical Boolean networks (CBNs), all nodes update their values at the same time called as synchronous Boolean network (SBNs). However, a criticism of CBNs as models of genetic regulatory networks is that genes do not update their values all simultaneously. To reflect this property of gene regulatory networks, <italic>Harvey</italic> and <italic>Bossomaier</italic> defined asynchronous Boolean networks (ABNs) where the random nodes were selected at each time and updated <xref rid="pone.0060593-Harvey1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Since that, depending on the different update schemes, Boolean networks can be generally categorized into synchronous Boolean networks <xref rid="pone.0060593-Faur1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0060593-Naldi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and asynchronous Boolean networks <xref rid="pone.0060593-Faur1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060593-Garg1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060593-Devloo1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060593-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. For the same update schemes with different priority of activator or inhibitor in genetic regulatory networks, classical equations <xref rid="pone.0060593-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, prior inhibitor equations <xref rid="pone.0060593-Garg1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and a combination of these two <xref rid="pone.0060593-Ay1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> are three types of Boolean translation functions. Therefore, given a Boolean network, there will be <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e002.jpg"/></inline-formula> different methods to represent its Boolean translation function.</p>
    <p>In a synchronous Boolean network, all genes update their values simultaneously at consecutive time points. <italic>Heidel et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0060593-Heidel1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and <italic>Farrow et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0060593-Farrow1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> have proposed a scalar equation approach to compute attractors in SBNs. Based on the former, <italic>Zhao</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0060593-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> has proven that the way of computing attractors in SBNs is a NP-complete problem. <italic>Dubrova et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0060593-Dubrova1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> have presented two tools - <italic>BooleNet</italic> and <italic>Bns</italic> - to compute attractors of SBNs. By contrast, in an asynchronous Boolean network, all genes update their values at different time points. Because each interaction between two nodes of a biological network follows distinct kinetics, it is generally thought that ABNs more realistically represent biological networks. However, due to the complexity of ABNs, the algorithms for computing network attractors are still mostly based on SBNs.</p>
    <p>Previously, <italic>Garg et al.</italic> proposed a solution to compute the attractors in both SBNs and one class of ABNs <xref rid="pone.0060593-Garg1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. First, they demonstrated that there were four types of attractors in a Boolean network: <italic>self loop</italic>, <italic>simple loop</italic>, <italic>syn-complex loop [or simple loop (type2)]</italic>, and <italic>asyn-complex loop</italic>, shown as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060593-g001">Fig. 1</xref>. The first two types (i.e. <italic>self loop</italic> and <italic>simple loop</italic>) were shared by SBNs and ABNs. But the latter two types, the <italic>syn-complex loop</italic> and the <italic>asyn-complex loop</italic>, were respectively found in SBNs and ABNs. Subsequently, they developed a series of algorithms which could be applied to compute the four types of attractors in a given Boolean network. Based on Garg’s contribution, <italic>Ay F et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0060593-Ay1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> gave a faster method to list the states of <italic>self loops</italic> and <italic>one outgoing edge</italic>. Both <italic>Garg et al.</italic> and <italic>Ay et al.</italic> used the <italic>ROBDD</italic> data structure to support their algorithms.</p>

    <p>Here, we developed two algorithms to further improve the computation of complex attractors in both SBNs and ABNs. First, based on the works of <italic>Garg et al.</italic>, and <italic>Ay et al.</italic>, we show that iterative computing can be used to accelerate the identification of the attractors of SBNs. Second, we develop a method to compute the <italic>asyn-complex loop (complex loop)</italic> using <italic>syn-complex loop</italic>, which allows us to simplify the computation of attractors of complex loops in ABNs. We have a software package to accomplish our two algorithms which are used to locate attractors of Boolean dynamic networks (for both SBNs and ABNs), with significantly reduced time. The structure of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives the methods to compute attractors and splits them into two subsections. Section 2.1 presents iterative computing attractors’ theory and its algorithms for SBNs. Section 2.2 proves a novel algorithm to locate attractors of ABNs from attractors of SBNs by asynchronous Boolean translation functions (ABTF). Section 3 tests feasibility and efficiency of our algorithm by several classical experimental benchmarks. Section 4 gives a conclusion and description of the future work.</p>

        <p>Because an attractor of a Boolean network is not known in advance, a common way to address this problem is setting a randomly chosen state as the initial state and exhaustively searching the entire state space. This approach has been successfully applied in several studies to compute the network attractors using empirically derived biological networks. However, the computational burden of this approach increases exponentially with respect to the number and length of attractors. Thus, it limits the application of this method for large biological networks.</p>
        <p>Due to the recurrent nature of attractors, we reason that iterative computing algorithms can be applied on the Boolean translation functions of SBNs, like <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e049.jpg"/></inline-formula>. An important implication is that identifying all attractors (Definition 1) does not require the computation of the entire state space. This suggests that we can use iterative computing to accelerate the identification of attractors in a given Boolean network. In the following, we present three theorems and their proof for iterative computation. Incorporating these theorems, an algorithm is demonstrated to compute attractors of SBNs.</p>

        <title>An improved algorithm to compute attractors in synchronous boolean networks</title>
        <p>Combining iterative computing (Theorem 1, 2, 3 and Eq. 5) and the ROBDD data structure, we have developed Algorithm 1 to compute attractors in SBNs. The input of Algorithm 1 is the synchronous Boolean translation function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e113.jpg"/></inline-formula>; its output is states of attractors (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e114.jpg"/></inline-formula>) and number of all attractors (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e115.jpg"/></inline-formula>). Specifically, Algorithm 1 starts with an initializing part, which initializes all the necessary variables. This is followed by a resolving part, which computes and deletes redundant attractors in a network. The resolving part further contains four components. The first component (Lines 12–13) will continue the next iterative computing and delete the visited attractors based on Theorem 1 and Eq. 5. The second component (Lines 15–20) judges whether synchronous Boolean translation functions are periodic or not, which has been proved by Theorem 2 and 3. The third component (Lines 22–27) verifies whether there will be a new attractor generated after one iteration. That is, if existing a new attractor, Algorithm 1 will add it into attractors (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e116.jpg"/></inline-formula>). Meanwhile, it will also update the attractors’ number (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e117.jpg"/></inline-formula>) and continue the next iteration. If not, Algorithm 1 will go to the next iterative computing. The last component (Lines 11, 29) contains the fix-point condition. When satisfying this condition, it will output attractors and number of attractors. For more detailed information, please read the Algorithms 1.</p>
        <p>In the initializing part, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e118.jpg"/></inline-formula> is the times of iterations. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e119.jpg"/></inline-formula> is an empty set. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e120.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e121.jpg"/></inline-formula> are the attractors and number of attractors, respectively. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e122.jpg"/></inline-formula> is the fix-point condition to judge whether the algorithm can be terminated or not. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e123.jpg"/></inline-formula> represents the states that will return to themselves after <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e124.jpg"/></inline-formula> iterations by synchronous Boolean translation function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e125.jpg"/></inline-formula>. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e126.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e127.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e128.jpg"/></inline-formula> are ROBDD data structures. In the main resolving part, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e129.jpg"/></inline-formula> represents state number of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e130.jpg"/></inline-formula>. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e131.jpg"/></inline-formula> are all the states that can reach to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e132.jpg"/></inline-formula> by synchronous Boolean translation function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e133.jpg"/></inline-formula>.</p>
        <p>Algorithm 1 is different with <italic>Garg et al.</italic>, which randomly picks up a state from state space and computes its forward reachable states to get an attractor. If you want to find out the attractors whose length is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e134.jpg"/></inline-formula>, it needs to exhaustively search the state space. However, our algorithm can easily compute the same attractors in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e135.jpg"/></inline-formula> times iterative computing.</p>

      <title>Computing Attractors in Asynchronous Boolean Networks</title>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, SBNs and ABNs differ in nodes updating schemes of Boolean translation functions. Instead of updating values of all the nodes simultaneously, ABNs only allow some of the nodes to update their values at a time point. For this reason, the computing of attractors in ABNs is more time consuming. Especially, it needs more intermediate steps when there are more than one bit different between two states.</p>
      <sec id="s2b1">
        <title>Analysis of attractors in asynchronous boolean networks</title>
        <p>It is essential to give a simple description of types of attractors. As represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060593-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, there are four types of attractors, <italic>self loop</italic>, <italic>simple loop</italic>, <italic>syn-complex loop</italic> and <italic>asyn-complex loop</italic> in both SBNs and ABNs. A <italic>self loop</italic> is a single state attractor, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060593-g001">Fig.1</xref> (a). A <italic>simple loop</italic> includes two or more states, where every state is connected with only another state, and any two adjacent states differ from each other by only one bit, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060593-g001">Fig.1</xref> (b). A <italic>syn-complex loop</italic> is similar to <italic>simple loop</italic>, but any two adjacent states differ from each other by more than one bit, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060593-g001">Fig.1</xref> (c). A <italic>asyn-complex loop</italic> includes multiple interlinked states: every state is connected with more than one states, and there is only one bit different between any two adjacent states, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060593-g001">Fig.1</xref> (d). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060593-g001">Fig. 1</xref> (a)(b)(c) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060593-g001">Fig. 1</xref> (a)(b)(d) stand for the different types of attractors in SBNs and ABNs, respectively.</p>
        <p>According to the properties of <italic>self loops</italic> and <italic>simple loops</italic>, they can easily be identified in SBNs, which also are same in ABNs. Interestingly, a closer examination of the structure of the <italic>syn-complex loops</italic> and <italic>asyn-complex loops</italic> suggests that every <italic>asyn-complex loop</italic> contains one <italic>syn-complex loop</italic> or some <italic>transient states</italic>. This suggests that it is possible to use <italic>syn-complex loop</italic> to easily locate the states in <italic>asyn-complex_loop</italic> by asynchronous Boolean translation functions.</p>
        <p>One example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060593-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, here <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e171.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e172.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e173.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e174.jpg"/></inline-formula>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060593-g002">Fig. 2(a)</xref> is an asynchronous attractor, where the current state and its next states are different by one bit. Suppose that the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e175.jpg"/></inline-formula> bit of the state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e176.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e177.jpg"/></inline-formula> is different. If <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e178.jpg"/></inline-formula>, it means that state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e179.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e180.jpg"/></inline-formula> are the same. The situation is also true for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e181.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e182.jpg"/></inline-formula>. If state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e183.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e184.jpg"/></inline-formula> are different at the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e185.jpg"/></inline-formula> bit, then state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e186.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e187.jpg"/></inline-formula> must differ at the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e188.jpg"/></inline-formula> bit. Otherwise, state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e189.jpg"/></inline-formula> cannot reach state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e190.jpg"/></inline-formula> by changing one bit. When state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e191.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e192.jpg"/></inline-formula> differ at the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e193.jpg"/></inline-formula> bit, state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e194.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e195.jpg"/></inline-formula> will be different at the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e196.jpg"/></inline-formula> bit, and vice versa. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060593-g002">Fig. 2(b)</xref> shows the corresponding synchronous attractor to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060593-g002">Fig. 2(a)</xref>. The difference is that state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e197.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e198.jpg"/></inline-formula> differ in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e199.jpg"/></inline-formula> and bits simultaneously. Other relations are the same except for state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e200.jpg"/></inline-formula>. Therefore, an <italic>asyn-complex_loop</italic> contains one <italic>syn-complex loop</italic> or some <italic>transient states</italic>. That means we can use <italic>syn-complex loop</italic> to easily locate the states in <italic>asyn-complex_loop</italic> by asynchronous Boolean translation function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e201.jpg"/></inline-formula>.</p>

        <title>An algorithm to compute attractors in asynchronous boolean networks</title>
        <p>An important implication of the above analysis is that the attractors of the ABNs can be derived from the attractors of the SBNs using synchronous and asynchronous Boolean translation functions. Therefore, we use attractors computed by Algorithm 1 in SBNs as the basis input for the new algorithm (Algorithm 2) to compute attractors of ABNs.</p>
        <p>Specifically, Algorithm 2 can be divided into three parts: initializing part (Lines 3–6), main resolving part (Lines 8–41) and checking unvisited states part (Lines 44–52). The initializing part also initializes all necessary variables in Algorithm 2. The main resolving part also can be split into five components. The first component (Lines 11–15) means <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e228.jpg"/></inline-formula> is a <italic>self loop</italic>. The second component (Lines 18–21) means <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e229.jpg"/></inline-formula> is a <italic>simple loop</italic>. The third component (Lines 24–29) means <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e230.jpg"/></inline-formula> is an unvisited <italic>asyn-complex loop</italic> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e231.jpg"/></inline-formula> is an unvisited <italic>syn-complex loop</italic>. The forth component (Lines 32–34) means <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e232.jpg"/></inline-formula> is a visited <italic>asyn-complex loop</italic> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e233.jpg"/></inline-formula> is an unvisited <italic>syn-complex loop</italic>. The fifth component (Lines 37–40) means <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e234.jpg"/></inline-formula> is the set of <italic>transient states</italic> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e235.jpg"/></inline-formula> is an unvisited <italic>syn-complex loop</italic>. After the main resolving part, if there exists unvisited states, Algorithm 2 will go to the checking unvisited states part. This part will check the unvisited states and report the left <italic>asyn-complex loops</italic>. For more detailed information, please read the Algorithms 2.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, in the initializing part, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e236.jpg"/></inline-formula> is a state, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e237.jpg"/></inline-formula> is an empty set, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e238.jpg"/></inline-formula> is a set of recording unvisited states by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e239.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e240.jpg"/></inline-formula> is the universal set. In the main resolving part and checking unvisited part, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e241.jpg"/></inline-formula> represents picking up anyone state from attractors <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e242.jpg"/></inline-formula> of SBNs. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e243.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e244.jpg"/></inline-formula> are the reachable states from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e245.jpg"/></inline-formula> by synchronous Boolean translation function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e246.jpg"/></inline-formula> and asynchronous Boolean translation function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e247.jpg"/></inline-formula>, respectively. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e248.jpg"/></inline-formula> is the reachable states to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e249.jpg"/></inline-formula> by asynchronous Boolean translation function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e250.jpg"/></inline-formula>. We note that, our approach of identifying attractors is totaly different with <italic>Gary et al.</italic> and <italic>Ay et al</italic>. It is more efficient to compute the <italic>asyn-complex loop</italic> because it can easily locate the states in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e251.jpg"/></inline-formula>.</p>

    <title>Results and Discussion</title>
    <p>We have implemented our methodology in a software package called <italic>geneFAtt</italic>, which is based on a ROBDD data structure named BuDDy <xref rid="pone.0060593-LindNielsen1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In this package, there are two parts, source code and benchmark. The source code part implements functions of Algorithm 1 (iterative computing attractors in synchronous Boolean networks) and Algorithm 2 (computing and classifying attractors as four types of synchronous Boolean networks and asynchronous Boolean networks). Algorithm 1 computes the attractors of SBNs, which are then used as the input of Algorithm 2 to classify the attractors of ABNs. Because the <italic>self loop</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060593-g001">Fig. 1(a)</xref>) and <italic>simple loop</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060593-g001">Fig. 1(b)</xref>) of SBNs are same with its corresponding type of attractors of ABNs, respectively. We can easily use <italic>syn-complex loops</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060593-g001">Fig. 1(c)</xref>) to locate the <italic>asyn-complex loops</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060593-g001">Fig. 1(d)</xref>) by the asynchronous Boolean translation functions. The benchmark part includes five biological networks, <italic>Mammalian Cell</italic>

<xref rid="pone.0060593-Klamt1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> have been studied in <xref rid="pone.0060593-Garg1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. <italic>Protein-ex</italic> is an extended case from <italic>Heidel et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0060593-Heidel1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. It also represents a kind of biological networks that all the states are in attractors. Because we adopt to the same methods of modeling the SBNs and ABNs to setup the synchronous and asynchronous Boolean translation functions refereed to <italic>Garg et al.</italic> Meanwhile, using the same inputs, <italic>geneFAtt</italic> can obtain the same attractors as those by <italic>genYsis</italic>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>This paper has addressed a method to compute attractors in SBNs and ABNs. We have developed a new iterative computing algorithm to identify the attractors <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0060593.e313.jpg"/></inline-formula> of SBNs. Meanwhile, another computing and classifying algorithm has been proposed to locate the attractors of ABNs rapidly. Our approaches give a significant acceleration of computing and locating attractors in biological networks. It is a big challenge that how to identify attractors in the large biological networks. Based on above research, it is expected that we can find a pathway to resolve this problem from the modeling methods of biological networks.</p>
