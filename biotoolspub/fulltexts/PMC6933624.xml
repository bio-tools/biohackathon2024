        <title>Background</title>
        <p id="Par1">Studying multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) synergism in gene regulation could help to understand the regulatory mechanisms of complicated human diseases caused by miRNAs. Several existing methods have been presented to infer miRNA synergism. Most of the current methods assume that miRNAs with shared targets at the sequence level are working synergistically. However, it is unclear if miRNAs with shared targets are working in concert to regulate the targets or they individually regulate the targets at different time points or different biological processes. A standard method to test the synergistic activities is to knock-down multiple miRNAs at the same time and measure the changes in the target genes. However, this approach may not be practical as we would have too many sets of miRNAs to test.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Results</title>
        <p id="Par2">n this paper, we present a novel framework called miRsyn for inferring miRNA synergism by using a causal inference method that mimics the multiple-intervention experiments, e.g. knocking-down multiple miRNAs, with observational data. Our results show that several miRNA-miRNA pairs that have shared targets at the sequence level are not working synergistically at the expression level. Moreover, the identified miRNA synergistic network is small-world and biologically meaningful, and a number of miRNA synergistic modules are significantly enriched in breast cancer. Our further analyses also reveal that most of synergistic miRNA-miRNA pairs show the same expression patterns. The comparison results indicate that the proposed multiple-intervention causal inference method performs better than the single-intervention causal inference method in identifying miRNA synergistic network.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p id="Par3">Taken together, the results imply that miRsyn is a promising framework for identifying miRNA synergism, and it could enhance the understanding of miRNA synergism in breast cancer.</p>

    <title>Background</title>
    <p id="Par15">MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short non-coding RNAs with ~ 23 nucleotides (nts) in length. They play an important regulatory role at the post-transcriptional level by targeting messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for degradation or translation repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated that miRNAs play a crucial role in regulating gene expression involved in diverse biological processes, including cell proliferation, cell death, cell apoptosis and human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Generally, the relationships between miRNAs and their target genes are not one-to-one but many-to-many, indicating cooperative regulation of miRNAs. The co-regulation of miRNAs has been accepted and confirmed by cross-linking and immunoprecipitation technologies, and may be related to human complex diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, studying miRNA synergism can greatly help to understand the synergistic regulation mechanism of miRNAs in human diseases.</p>
    <p id="Par16">Until now, a number of computational methods have been proposed to identify miRNA synergism. These methods can be divided into three different categories: (1) sequence-based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], (2) correlation-based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and (3) causality-based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In the first category, the sequence data mainly includes putative miRNA-target interactions and protein-protein interactions (PPIs). For each candidate miRNA-miRNA pair, the methods firstly evaluate the significance of common target genes by using a hypergeometric test. Then, by conducting Gene Ontology (GO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] or Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] enrichment analysis of the shared target genes, they determine whether a candidate miRNA-miRNA pair is functionally synergistic or not. The main limitation of the methods in this category is that they only use static data in the study of miRNA synergism. In fact, the co-regulation between miRNAs is usually dynamic in human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Methods in the second category use expression data of miRNAs to identify differentially expressed miRNA synergistic network or integrate matched miRNA and mRNA expression data with sequence data to infer miRNA synergistic networks. However, the identified miRNA synergistic networks or modules using statistic correlation methods may not reveal the causal relationships of gene regulation. To address this issue, a causality-based method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] (the third category) has been presented to infer miRNA-target causal relationships. The method only simulates the causal effect in single-intervention experiments, e.g. knocking-down a single miRNA each time. However, miRNA co-regulation simultaneously involves multiple miRNAs.</p>
    <p id="Par17">In general, the miRNA-miRNA synergistic pairs identified by several existing methods at the sequence level may not crosstalk with each other to co-regulate target genes at the expression level. Previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] has shown that miRNAs tend to synergistically control expression levels of target genes. It is necessary to integrate expression data for identifying miRNA-miRNA synergistic pairs at the expression level. Moreover, all existing approaches don’t explicitly look at “simultaneous” co-regulation of multiple miRNAs on the target genes, e.g. causal effects of multiple synergistic miRNAs on the shared target genes.</p>
    <p id="Par18">To address the above issues, in this work, we present a framework called miRsyn for inferring miRNA synergism from both sequence-based binding information and expression data by simulating multiple-intervention experiments, e.g. knocking-down multiple miRNAs at the same time. We apply the proposed method to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer dataset. The results show that several miRNAs that have shared targets at the sequence level may not be working synergistically at the expression level, and the miRNA synergistic modules discovered are strongly related to breast cancer. Our further analyses also reveal that most of synergistic miRNA-miRNA pairs tend to be co-expressed, which help make a rapid response to external disturbances. Finally, the comparison results demonstrate that multiple-intervention causal inference method performs better than single-intervention causal inference method in studying miRNA synergism.</p>

      <title>Overview of miRsyn</title>
      <p id="Par19">As illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, miRsyn is a step-wise method for identifying miRNA synergism. Firstly, given matched miRNA and mRNA expression data, we use feature selection based on the Cox regression model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] to identify significant miRNAs and mRNAs. Then, by using multiple-intervention causal inference method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], we obtain joint causal effects between the significant miRNAs and mRNAs. At the same time, the putative miRNA-target binding information is used to generate regulatory relationships between significant miRNAs and mRNAs. By integrating joint causal effects and binary relationships between significant miRNAs and mRNAs, we find a set of miRNAs with the maximum joint causal effect on each mRNA. The miRNAs in each set of miRNAs synergistically regulate their target mRNAs, and all synergistic miRNA-miRNA pairs are combined to construct the miRNA synergistic network. To identify miRNA synergistic modules, we firstly find a set of bi-cliques with at least 2 miRNAs and mRNAs based on putative miRNA-mRNA binding information. For each bi-clique, the subset of bi-clique with the maximum joint causal effect is regarded as a miRNA synergistic module. Finally, we conduct functional analysis of miRNA synergism at both network and module levels.
<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The workflow of miRsyn. The process contains three main steps. Firstly, we identify significant miRNAs and mRNAs using feature selection from miRNA and mRNA expression data. Secondly, by integrating expression data of significant miRNAs and mRNAs and putative miRNA-target interactions, we identify miRNA synergistic network and modules. Finally, we make a functional analysis of the identified miRNA synergistic network and modules</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12859_2019_3215_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

      <title>Topological and functional analysis of miRNA synergism</title>
      <p id="Par29">The topological analysis of miRNA synergism could help to understand the internal organization of miRNA synergistic network, e.g. power law degree distribution, the average clustering coefficient and the average characteristic path length. If the node degree in a biological network obeys a power law curve (in the form of <italic>y</italic> = <italic>bx</italic><sup><italic>a</italic></sup>) distribution with high value of <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>, the network is regarded to be scale-free. Here, the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value is a deterministic coefficient to measure the quality of a power curve fit. The interval of <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value is [0 1]. A larger <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value indicates a better power law curve fit. The average clustering coefficient is used to evaluate the dense neighborhood of a biological network. In a small-world biological network, the average characteristic path length is much larger than that of random networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The average characteristic path length indicates the density of a biological network. In a small-world biological network, the average characteristic path length is smaller than that of random networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
      <p id="Par30">In this work, we obtain topological features (power law degree distribution, the average clustering coefficient and the average characteristic path length) of the miRNA synergistic network by using the <italic>NetworkAnalyzer</italic> plugin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] in Cytoscape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

We construct 10,000 random instances by randomizing the miRNA synergistic network, and calculate the average clustering coefficient and the average characteristic path length of networks.</p>
      <p id="Par31">We conduct functional enrichment analysis to investigate the biological functions of miRNA synergism. For the identified miRNA synergistic network, we use the online tool miEAA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] to infer the significantly enriched or depleted biological processes, pathways and diseases associated with synergistic miRNAs (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05).

      <title>MiRNA synergistic network is small-world and biologically meaningful</title>
      <p id="Par36">By following the steps of Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, we have identified a list of 702 miRNA-miRNA synergistic pairs between 78 miRNAs (details can be seen in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). These miRNA-miRNA synergistic pairs are integrated into a miRNA synergistic network. Out of the 78 miRNAs, the number of breast cancer related miRNAs is 39 (red nodes in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The hub miRNAs with higher degrees in miRNA synergistic network tend to be essential. In this work, 8 miRNAs with higher degrees (about 10% of miRNAs in miRNA synergistic network) are regarded as hub miRNAs. Except one hub miRNA (miR-186-5p), 7 hub miRNAs (miR-10a-5p, and miR-150-5p, miR-192-5p, miR-26a-5p, miR-301a-3p, miR-484, miR-98-5p) are breast cancer related miRNAs. This result indicates that most of hub miRNAs are breast cancer causal miRNAs. We define that breast cancer related miRNA-miRNA pairs are those in which the two synergistic parties are breast cancer related miRNAs. As a result, we obtain a list of 269 breast cancer related miRNA-miRNA pairs (details can be seen in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

      <p id="Par37">As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> (table at the bottom of the figure), the distribution of node degrees of the miRNA synergistic network do not follow power law distribution with <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.192. This result indicates that the identified miRNA synergistic network is not scale-free. However, the miRNA synergistic network exhibits dense local neighborhoods with the average clustering coefficient of 0.528, which is much larger than that of random networks (0.178 ± 0.037). In addition, the miRNAs in the network are closely connected with the average characteristic path length of 1.837, which is smaller than that of random networks (2.511 ± 0.048). Altogether, the dense local neighborhoods and the small average characteristic path length imply that the miRNA synergistic network is small-world, and can be used to predict miRNA synergism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
      <p id="Par38">To investigate the potential biological processes, pathways and diseases related to the synergistic miRNAs, we conduct functional enrichment analysis of them. As shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, the synergistic miRNAs are significantly enriched in several biological processes, pathways and diseases associated with breast cancer, such as cell cycle (GO0007050, GO0007093) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>],cell division (GO0051781) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], cell apoptosis (GO0002903, GO0042981, GO0043065, hsa04210) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], cell migration (GO0030334, GO0010595, GO0030335,) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], cell differentiation (GO0045595, GO0045446,) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], cell proliferation (GO0050678, GO0072091) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], signaling pathway (P00038, P00056, WP304) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and Breast Neoplasms.

      <title>A number of miRNA synergistic modules are significantly enriched in breast cancer</title>
      <p id="Par39">We have identified 361 miRNA synergistic modules by following the steps in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> (details in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). To understand whether the identified miRNA synergistic modules are closely associated with breast cancer, we conduct breast cancer enrichment analysis of these modules. As a result, the number of miRNA synergistic modules significantly enriched in breast cancer is 72 (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05), indicating that a number of miRNA synergistic modules is closely related to the biological condition of breast cancer dataset (details in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p>

      <title>Most of synergistic miRNA-miRNA pairs show the same expression patterns</title>
      <p id="Par40">In this study, we use Pearson correlation of each synergistic miRNA-miRNA pair to measure the co-expression level. A synergistic miRNA-miRNA pair with significantly positive correlation (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) is regarded as a co-expressed pair. Out of 702 synergistic miRNA-miRNA pairs, we discover that 499 synergistic miRNA-miRNA pairs are co-expressed (details in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). This result indicates that most of synergistic miRNA-miRNA pairs (~ 71.08%) show similar expression patterns. It also implies that most miRNAs with similar expression patterns would like to collaborate with each other to co-regulate target genes. The result is consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p>

      <title>Several synergistic miRNA-mRNA pairs at the sequence level are not working synergistically at the expression level</title>
      <p id="Par41">At the sequence level, we only use putative miRNA-target interactions to construct miRNA synergistic network. In this work, we use the DmirSRN motif in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] to generate miRNA synergistic regulatory network. Consequently, we find that 1313 miRNA-miRNA pairs can directly regulate the same target by cooperating with each other at the sequence level (details in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Out of 1313 synergistic miRNA-miRNA pairs at the sequence level, 611 miRNA-miRNA pairs are not working synergistically at the expression level by comparing with the miRNA synergistic network generated by miRsyn (details in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>).

      <title>Comparison results</title>
      <p id="Par42">There are several existing methods to infer miRNA synergistic network by using different types of datasets. However, to have a fair comparison (i.e. using the same data types and similar inference method for estimating causal effects of miRNAs on mRNAs), we focus the comparison on one existing method mirSRN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] only.</p>
      <p id="Par43">The comparison result of our method miRsyn with mirSRN is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The detailed results of mirSRN can be seen in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>. In terms of the identified miRNA synergistic pairs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a), the number of miRNA synergistic pairs predicted by miRsyn (702) is more than that by mirSRN (239). The majority of the identified miRNA synergistic pairs by mirSRN (163) are predicted by miRsyn. As for the significantly enriched terms (Gene Ontology, Pathways and Diseases) associated with the identified miRNA synergistic network (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b), the identified miRNA synergistic network from miRsyn is significantly enriched in more number of functional terms excepting the terms of Diseases.

      <p id="Par44">For the comparison in the percentage of breast cancer miRNAs and miRNA synergistic pairs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c), the constructed miRNA synergistic network by mirSRN contains higher percentage of breast cancer miRNAs. However, the constructed miRNA synergistic network by mirSRN involves higher percentage of breast cancer miRNA synergistic pairs. Since the dense local neighborhoods and the small average characteristic path length can be exploited to predict miRNA synergism, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c implies that miRsyn is more suitable than mirSRN to identify miRNA synergism.</p>
      <p id="Par45">As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d, most of synergistic miRNA-miRNA pairs identified by both miRsyn (~ 71.08%, 499 out of 702) and mirSRN (~ 82.43%, 197 out of 239) all show the same expression patterns. This comparison result indicates that the findings from miRsyn and mirSRN are consistent with each other. Although there is still no ground-truth for validating miRNA-miRNA synergistic pairs, we can use putative high-confidence miRNA-miRNA from the third-party database. In this work, we use the PmmR database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] to compare the overlap with putative miRNA synergistic pairs between miRSyn and mirSRN. The score (the interval is [0 1]) in the PmmR database indicates the strength of each miRNA-miRNA synergistic pair, and a larger score denotes a stronger strength. Under different score cutoffs (range from 0.50 to 0.70 with a step of 0.05), the overlap of miRsyn is always larger than that of mirSRN (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e). This result indicates that several synergistic miRNA-miRNA pairs predicted by miRsyn (missed by mirSRN) still overlap with PmmR database.</p>
      <p id="Par46">In sum, the above comparison results indicate miRsyn is more suitable than mirSRN in studying miRNA synergism.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par47">It is known that human complex diseases such as cancers are affected by multiple miRNAs rather than individual miRNA. Therefore, identifying miRNA synergism is important to understand the regulatory mechanisms of human complex diseases.</p>
    <p id="Par48">In this work, we have proposed a framework called miRsyn to identify miRNA synergism from both sequence and expression data. By using multiple-intervention causal inference, we simulated the causal effects of multiple miRNAs on target genes in the multiple-intervention experiments. To study miRNA synergism, we have conducted analysis at both network and module levels.</p>
    <p id="Par49">Topological analysis has shown that the constructed miRNA synergistic network is not scale-free, but small-world. The small-worldness may help the synergism of miRNAs to quickly adapt to a new biological environment caused by disturbances. In addition, most of synergistic miRNA-miRNA pairs show the same expression patterns, which allows for a rapid response to external disturbances.</p>
    <p id="Par50">We have also discovered that some miRNA-miRNA pairs at the sequence level are not working synergistically at the expression level. This result implies that it is necessary to study miRNA synergism from heterogeneous data sources. To further reveal the potential functions, we conducted functional enrichment analysis of synergistic miRNAs. The miRNA enrichment analysis results display that the identified miRNA synergistic network is directly or indirectly associated with the biological condition of breast cancer dataset. Moreover, by conducting breast cancer enrichment analysis, we have found that several miRNA synergistic modules are significantly enriched in breast cancer.</p>
    <p id="Par51">We compared our method miRsyn with mirSRN in different terms, including the number of synergistic miRNA pairs, the number of significantly enriched terms, the percentage of breast cancer miRNAs and miRNA synergistic pairs, clustering coefficient and characteristic path length, the number of co-expression and non co-expression miRNA synergistic pairs, and the overlap with putative miRNA synergistic pairs under different score cutoffs. The comparison results show that miRsyn (simulating multiple gene knock-down experiments) is more suitable than mirSRN (simulating single gene knock-down experiments) to identify miRNA synergism. For this current work, in order to have a fair comparison (i.e. using the same data types and similar inference method for estimating causal effects of miRNAs on mRNAs), we focus the comparison on one existing method mirSRN only. However, it is helpful to compare miRsyn to other different methods as well. In future, to further show the performance of miRsyn in studying miRNA synergism, we will conduct more comprehensive comparison.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p id="Par52">Taken altogether, this work provides a novel framework to identify miRNA synergism that can be applied in variable biological fields. The presented results from the proposed method could provide insights to understand the synergistic roles of miRNAs in breast cancer. We believe that the presented method is applicable to the study of miRNA synergism associated with other human complex diseases.</p>
