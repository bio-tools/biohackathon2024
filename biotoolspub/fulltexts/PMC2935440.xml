      <p><bold>Motivation:</bold> Considerable attention has been focused on predicting RNA–RNA interaction since it is a key to identifying possible targets of non-coding small RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. A number of computational studies have so far been devoted to predicting joint secondary structures or binding sites under a specific class of interactions. In general, there is a trade-off between range of interaction type and efficiency of a prediction algorithm, and thus efficient computational methods for predicting comprehensive type of interaction are still awaited.</p>
      <p><bold>Results:</bold> We present <monospace>RactIP</monospace>, a fast and accurate prediction method for RNA–RNA interaction of general type using integer programming. <monospace>RactIP</monospace> can integrate approximate information on an ensemble of equilibrium joint structures into the objective function of integer programming using posterior internal and external base-paring probabilities. Experimental results on real interaction data show that prediction accuracy of <monospace>RactIP</monospace> is at least comparable to that of several state-of-the-art methods for RNA–RNA interaction prediction. Moreover, we demonstrate that <monospace>RactIP</monospace> can run incomparably faster than competitive methods for predicting joint secondary structures.</p>

    <title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Recent years have seen a renewal of interest in the biological roles of functional non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Modern studies have provided evidence that they can act as ubiquitous regulators in living cells (Eddy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2001</xref>; Vogel and Wagner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2007</xref>). A class of small ncRNAs downregulates gene expression post-transcriptionally via base-pairing with target mRNAs of the ncRNAs to inhibit the translation into the corresponding proteins. Eukaryotic microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are very short and have almost full sequence complementarity to their targets. On the other hand, several regulatory <italic>antisense RNAs</italic> have been found in bacterial chromosomes, which have relatively long sequences and interact with their target mRNAs in a more intricate manner (Brantl, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2002</xref>). This type of interaction comes from the fact that the genes encoding the antisense RNAs are located at loci different from those encoding their targets (i.e. <italic>trans</italic>-encoded antisense RNAs) (Wagner and Flärdh, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2002</xref>). In particular, <italic>kissing hairpin</italic> structures (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) caused by loop–loop interaction have been observed (Brunel <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2002</xref>). To help to understand the mechanism of RNA–RNA interaction further, as well as to identify target RNAs of specific ncRNAs, it is desirable to develop fast and accurate computational methods for predicting interacting RNA structures.
<fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>An example of RNA–RNA interaction containing two kissing hairpins. A broken line represents an internal base pair, and a black circle indicates a base that constitutes an external base pair (binding site).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="btq372f1"/></fig></p>
    <p>RNA–RNA interaction prediction has so far been performed by several computational approaches, which can be roughly classified into four groups. The first group including <monospace>UNAFold</monospace> (Dimitrov and Zuker, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2004</xref>), <monospace>RNAhybrid</monospace> (Rehmsmeier <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2004</xref>) and <monospace>RNAduplex</monospace> from the Vienna RNA Package (Hofacker <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">1994</xref>; Hofacker, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2003</xref>) disregards intramolecular bonds in both sequences and computes the minimum free energy (MFE) hybridization. They work out for short interacting RNAs but are impracticable for long sequences with intramolecular structures. The second group belongs to the category that uses the idea of concatenating two RNA sequences and considering them as a single strand so that the MFE structure of the resulting sequence can be computed. <monospace>PairFold</monospace> (Andronescu <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2005</xref>) and <monospace>RNAcofold</monospace> (Bernhart <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2006</xref>) adopt this procedure, but these methods cannot predict general type of interaction such as kissing hairpins. Other approaches such as <monospace>RNAup</monospace> (Mückstein <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2006</xref>), <monospace>IntaRNA</monospace> (Busch <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2008</xref>), <monospace>inRNAs</monospace> (Salari <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2010a</xref>) and <monospace>bistaRNA</monospace> (Poolsap <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2010</xref>) fall into the third group, which considers RNA–RNA interaction as the stepwise process of individual intramolecular foldings and their hybridization. <monospace>RNAup</monospace> and <monospace>IntaRNA</monospace> can predict only one binding site, whereas <monospace>inRNAs</monospace> and <monospace>bistaRNA</monospace> can predict multiple binding sites. The final group aims at predicting the MFE joint secondary structure or computing the interaction partition function under the comprehensive type of interaction. <monospace>IRIS</monospace> (Pervouchine, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2004</xref>), <monospace>inteRNA</monospace> (Alkan <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2006</xref>), <monospace>RIG</monospace> (Kato <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2009</xref>), <monospace>piRNA</monospace> (Chitsaz <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2009</xref>), <monospace>rip</monospace> (Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2010</xref>) and also <monospace>inRNAs</monospace> (Salari <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2010a</xref>) are listed as this category. These methods impose natural constraints on the joint structure such that there are no internal pseudoknots, crossing interactions and zigzags (Alkan <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2006</xref>; Chitsaz <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2009</xref>). Note that Alkan <italic>et al.</italic> suggested that these constraints are satisfied by all examples of complex RNA–RNA interactions in the literature. In this sense, we can consider the class of joint structures satisfying those constraints the most general type of interaction. Although the final group can cover wider class of interacting structures simultaneously, their computational costs could be prohibitively expensive for long sequences.</p>
    <p>Prediction of interacting RNA structure can be considered as a kind of optimization problem in a sense that we seek to minimize the free energy of the joint structure or maximize a score such as an interaction probability under the possible topology of the interacting structure. Various problems presented in bioinformatics have been formulated as mathematical programming problems, where the objective function is minimized or maximized under some constraints. Recently, Bauer <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2007</xref>) presented <monospace>LARA</monospace> that implements an <italic>integer programming</italic>-based method for multiple structural alignment of RNA sequences. To reduce the computational cost of the structural alignment, they simplified the mathematical structure of the integer programming (IP) formulation, eliminating information on the topology of secondary structure from the constraints and integrating the structural information into the objective function, as well as using the Lagrangian relaxation. In general, IP problems are known to be NP-hard, but use of IP formulation fascinates us due to its strong and flexible descriptive power to model a large number of combinatorial optimization problems.</p>
    <p>Motivated in part by Bauer <italic>et al.</italic>'s work, we present a novel method called <monospace>RactIP</monospace>, RNA–RNA interACTion prediction using Integer Programming. In our IP formulation, the objective function, which is to be maximized, is defined as the sum of scores with respect to internal and external base pairs of two interacting RNAs. In particular, we make use of posterior probabilities such as <italic>base-pairing probabilities</italic> and <italic>hybridization probabilities</italic> for scores of internal pairs and those of external pairs, respectively, to incorporate further structural information into the objective function as in the case of <monospace>LARA</monospace> (Bauer <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2007</xref>). It is to be noted that use of such posterior probabilities enables the method to take account of an ensemble of equilibrium structures approximately, which will lead to improve expected accuracy. We introduce a <italic>threshold cut</italic> technique to solve the IP problem efficiently, which is shown to be reasonable from the viewpoint of maximizing expected accuracy. By virtue of this technique, <monospace>RactIP</monospace> achieves considerably short run-time despite the computational hardness of IP. We demonstrate the prediction performance of <monospace>RactIP</monospace> on a set of known interacting RNA pairs both for joint structure prediction and binding site prediction, making a comparison with several state-of-the-art methods. Advantages of <monospace>RactIP</monospace> are summarized as follows:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>As for joint secondary structure prediction under the most general type of interaction, <monospace>RactIP</monospace> can run overwhelmingly faster than competitive prediction methods with <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic><sup>6</sup>) time complexities, where <italic>n</italic> is the length of the longer input sequence. In fact, experimental results reveal that computation time of <monospace>RactIP</monospace> is an order of magnitude shorter than that of <monospace>inRNAs</monospace> (the joint structure prediction model) (Salari <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2010a</xref>), <monospace>inteRNA</monospace> (the Loop Model) (Alkan <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2006</xref>) and <monospace>rip</monospace> (Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2010</xref>). Recently, Salari <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2010b</xref>) proposed a sparsified dynamic programming algorithm whose time complexity is <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic><sup>5</sup>) on average. To the best of the authors' knowledge, <monospace>RactIP</monospace> is the fastest method for predicting both internal structures and binding sites simultaneously on condition of the comprehensive class of interactions.</p></list-item><list-item><p><monospace>RactIP</monospace> is comparable in accuracy to <monospace>inRNAs</monospace> (the joint structure prediction model) and outperforms <monospace>inteRNA</monospace> and <monospace>rip</monospace> for joint structure prediction. From the viewpoint of binding site prediction that disregards (predicted) internal base pairs, accuracy of <monospace>RactIP</monospace> is as good as that of <monospace>inRNAs</monospace> (the binding site prediction model) and better than that of <monospace>IntaRNA</monospace> (Busch <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2008</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>The mathematical model of <monospace>RactIP</monospace> is compact.

Compared with other computational approaches, it is easy to change the model to cope with a desired class of secondary structures simply by adding or removing appropriate constraints.

    <p>The rest of the article is organized as follows. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="SEC2">Section 2</xref> describes our prediction model <monospace>RactIP</monospace> in detail after providing several preliminaries to grasp it. We show experimental results of interaction prediction and discuss them in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="SEC3">Sections 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="SEC4">4</xref>, respectively. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="SEC5">Section 5</xref> concludes the article.</p>

    <title>2 METHODS</title>
    <p>We propose a new method <monospace>RactIP</monospace> for RNA–RNA interaction prediction using IP. <monospace>RactIP</monospace> executes the following two steps when two RNA sequences are given:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>compute the score matrices of the IP objective function for internal and external base pairs;</p></list-item><list-item><p>solve the IP problem to predict the optimal joint secondary structure.</p></list-item></list>
It should be noted that the program <monospace>RactIP</monospace> actually solves the IP problem using libraries of a high-performance solver (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="SEC3">Section 3</xref> for details).</p>
    <sec id="SEC2.1">
      <title>2.1 Scoring functions for predicting RNA–RNA interaction</title>
      <p>Let Σ = {A, C, G, U} and Σ<sup>*</sup> denote the set of all finite RNA sequences consisting of bases in Σ. For a sequence <italic>a</italic> ∈ Σ<sup>*</sup>, let |<italic>a</italic>| denote the number of symbols appearing in <italic>a</italic>, which is called the length of <italic>a</italic>. For 1 ≤ <italic>i</italic> &lt; <italic>j</italic> ≤ |<italic>a</italic>|, we let <italic>a</italic>[<italic>i</italic>..<italic>j</italic>] denote a sequence <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub><italic>a</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>+1</sub>···<italic>a</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> ∈ Σ<sup>*</sup>.</p>
      <p>Let 𝒮(<italic>a</italic>) be a space of all possible secondary structures of a sequence <italic>a</italic> ∈ Σ<sup>*</sup>. An element <italic>x</italic> ∈ 𝒮(<italic>a</italic>) is represented as a |<italic>a</italic>|<sup>2</sup> binary-valued triangular matrix <italic>x</italic> = (<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>)<sub><italic>i</italic>&lt;<italic>j</italic></sub>, where <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> = 1 means that bases <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> form a base pair. We denote by <italic>P</italic>(<italic>x</italic> ∣ <italic>a</italic>) a probability distribution over 𝒮(<italic>a</italic>). Let ℋ(<italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>) be a space of all possible hybridized structures between <italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic> ∈ Σ<sup>*</sup>, which considers no secondary structures of <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic>. An element <italic>z</italic> ∈ ℋ(<italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>) is represented as a |<italic>a</italic>| × |<italic>b</italic>| binary-valued matrix <italic>z</italic> = (<italic>z</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>), where <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> = 1 means that the base <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> interacts with the base <italic>b</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>. We denote by <italic>P</italic>(<italic>z</italic> ∣ <italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>) a probability distribution over ℋ(<italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>). Let 𝒥𝒮(<italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>) be a space of the joint secondary structures of <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> that considers both the secondary structures of <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> and the hybridized structures between <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic>. In other words, 𝒥𝒮(<italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>) is a subset of 𝒮(<italic>a</italic>) × 𝒮(<italic>b</italic>) × ℋ(<italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>). We denote by <italic>P</italic>(σ ∣ <italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>) a probability distribution over 𝒥𝒮(<italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>), where σ = (<italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, <italic>z</italic>) ∈ 𝒥𝒮(<italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>) such that <italic>x</italic> ∈ 𝒮(<italic>a</italic>), <italic>y</italic> ∈ 𝒮(<italic>b</italic>) and <italic>z</italic> ∈ ℋ(<italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>). We assume that each base can be paired with at most one base regardless of whether the base pair is formed inside or outside the sequence, and internal pseudoknots and crossing interactions (external pseudoknots) are disallowed.</p>
      <p>We now define the problem of predicting RNA-RNA interaction as follows:</p>
      <statement>
        <title>D<sc>efinition</sc> 1</title>
        <p>(RNA–RNA interaction prediction). <italic>Given two RNA sequences a</italic> = <italic>a</italic>[1..<italic>n</italic>] ∈ Σ<sup>*</sup> <italic>(</italic>5′–3′ <italic>direction) and b</italic> = <italic>b</italic>[1..<italic>m</italic>] ∈ Σ<sup>*</sup> <italic>(</italic>3′–5′ <italic>direction)</italic>, <italic>predict a joint secondary structure</italic> σ ∈ 𝒥𝒮(<italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>).</p>
      </statement>
      <p>To tackle this problem, we first define the gain function for the true joint structure σ = (<italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, <italic>z</italic>) and a predicted joint structure <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="btq372i1.jpg"/></inline-formula> as

      <p>Here, <italic>I</italic>(<italic>condition</italic>) is the indicator function that takes a value of 1 or 0 depending on whether the <italic>condition</italic> is true or false, γ<sub><italic>s</italic></sub> and γ<sub><italic>h</italic></sub> are weight parameters for base pairs, and α is a balancing parameter between internal base pairs and external base pairs. The gain function (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="M1">1</xref>) is equal to the weighted sum of the number of true positives and the number of true negatives of base pairs. In order to maximize the <italic>expected</italic> number of true predictions, we find a joint secondary structure <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="btq372i2.jpg"/></inline-formula> that maximizes the expectation of the gain function (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="M1">1</xref>) with respect to an ensemble of all possible joint secondary structures under a given posterior distribution:

      <p>For the posterior distribution <italic>P</italic>(σ ∣ <italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>) over a space of joint secondary structures, we can employ the <monospace>piRNA</monospace> model (Chitsaz <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2009</xref>) and the <monospace>rip</monospace> model (Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2010</xref>). However, these exact models are impractical since <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic><sup>6</sup>) time and <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic><sup>4</sup>) space are required where <italic>n</italic> is the length of the longer RNA sequence. Therefore, we approximate the posterior distribution over a space of joint secondary structures by its factorization:

Finally, we find a joint structure <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="btq372i4.jpg"/></inline-formula> that maximizes the approximate estimator (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="M4">4</xref>). We should notice that maximizing the approximate estimator (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="M4">4</xref>) is equivalent to maximizing the sum of: (i) the sum of the base-pairing probabilities <italic>p</italic><sup>(<italic>a</italic>)</sup><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> larger than θ<sub><italic>s</italic></sub> = 1/(γ<sub><italic>s</italic></sub>+1); (ii) the sum of the base-pairing probabilities <italic>p</italic><sup>(<italic>b</italic>)</sup><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> larger than θ<sub><italic>s</italic></sub>; and (iii) the sum of the hybridization probabilities <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> larger than θ<sub><italic>h</italic></sub> = 1/(γ<sub><italic>h</italic></sub>+1). This means that there is no need to consider the base pairs whose posterior probabilities are at most the predefined thresholds θ<sub><italic>s</italic></sub> and θ<sub><italic>h</italic></sub> so that the search space for the optimal structure can be reduced. This threshold cut technique makes our method run much faster.

The objective function (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="M5">5</xref>) shows an instantiation of the approximate estimator (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="M4">4</xref>) using the base-pairing probabilities and hybridization probabilities.

As suggested by Alkan <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2006</xref>), we set α ∈ (0, 1) so that external base pairs are less likely to be formed than internal ones. In this study, we fix α = 0.5, that is, external base pairs contribute to the objective function by half compared with internal base pairs. Constraints (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="M6">6</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="M7">7</xref>) mean that each base can be paired with at most one base regardless of whether the base pair is formed inside or outside the sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>a).

        <title>2.2.3 Incorporating stacked pairing constraints</title>
        <p>It is widely accepted that base pairs in stable RNA structures are likely to appear in a stacked form rather than an isolated one. Following the IP formulation for predicting secondary structure of a single RNA sequence proposed by Poolsap <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2009</xref>), we define further variables for promoting stacking base pairs as follows:

<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="btq372um4"/></disp-formula></p>

<disp-formula id="M12"><label>(12)</label><graphic xlink:href="btq372m12"/></disp-formula></p>
        <p>These constraints guarantee that if a base <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is paired with another one, the base(s) adjacent to <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> must also form a base pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>).

We employed the <monospace>CONTRAfold</monospace> model (Do <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2006</xref>) for the probability distribution of RNA secondary structures and the <monospace>RNAduplex</monospace> model for the probability distribution of hybridization of two RNA sequences. <monospace>CONTRAfold</monospace>, based on a machine-learning algorithm, is one of the most accurate programs for predicting RNA secondary structures.

      <title>3.3 Joint structure prediction</title>
      <p>We first conducted experiments in joint secondary structure prediction on the dataset compiled by Kato <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2009</xref>). The performance was evaluated by sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) defined as follows:
<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="btq372um5"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>TP</italic> is the number of correctly predicted base pairs, <italic>FN</italic> is the number of base pairs in the true structure that were not predicted, and <italic>FP</italic> is the number of incorrectly predicted base pairs. We also used <italic>F</italic>-measure as the balanced measure between sensitivity and PPV, which is defined as the harmonic mean of them:
<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="btq372um6"/></disp-formula></p>
      <p>We compared our method <monospace>RactIP</monospace> with two state-of-the-art methods: <monospace>inRNAs</monospace> (the exact model for joint structure prediction) (Salari <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2010a</xref>) and <monospace>inteRNA</monospace> (Alkan <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2006</xref>). The accuracy of <monospace>inRNAs</monospace> is extracted from their literature. In order to calculate the accuracy of <monospace>inteRNA</monospace>, we computed the joint structure of each pair in the dataset by using the <monospace>inteRNA</monospace> Web server with default settings (Aksay <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2007</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://compbio.cs.sfu.ca/taverna/interna/">http://compbio.cs.sfu.ca/taverna/interna/</ext-link>).</p>

We did not compare the running time strictly between the three methods due to difficulty in their availability. However, we would like to remark that Salari <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2010a</xref>) reported in their literature that <monospace>inRNAs</monospace> runs for ∼4000 s on Sun Fire X4600 2.6 GHz with 64 GB memory to predict the joint structures of CopA–CopT and IncRNA<sub>54</sub>-RepZ.

We compared <monospace>RactIP</monospace> with <monospace>rip</monospace>, which samples joint structures from internal and external base-pairing probabilities, and <monospace>RactIP</monospace> combined with <monospace>rip</monospace>, in which internal and external base-pairing probabilities calculated by <monospace>rip</monospace> were used in the IP [see Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="M5">5</xref>)] instead of factorized ones. Note that <monospace>rip</monospace> failed to calculate base-pairing probabilities for the CopA–CopT pair since their length might be too long for <monospace>rip</monospace>. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>, our approximation by factorization is significantly faster than the naïve calculation of base-pairing probabilities, though the accuracy of our approximation dropped slightly. The results indicate that our method can be applicable to joint secondary structure prediction for long sequences.

    <title>4 DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>We employed the threshold cut technique to reduce the search space for the optimal joint secondary structure, which makes <monospace>RactIP</monospace> run much faster than existing state-of-the-art algorithms for joint structure prediction. Let us stress again that there is a close relation between the threshold cut and maximizing expected accuracy. The scoring scheme of <monospace>RactIP</monospace> can be regarded as the generalized centroid estimator (Hamada <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2009</xref>) since the gain function (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="M1">1</xref>) with γ<sub><italic>s</italic></sub> = γ<sub><italic>h</italic></sub> and α = 1 corresponds to the γ-centroid estimator. As described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="SEC2.1">Section 2.1</xref>, the thresholds correspond to the weights for base pairs in Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="M1">1</xref>), which control the balance between the expected number of true positives and that of true negatives. This means that an appropriate choice of the thresholds will improve the balanced accuracy such as <italic>F</italic>-measure. See <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/btq372/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> for more details.</p>
    <p>In the experiments, we used the combination of the parameters derived from the machine-learning model and the ones from the thermodynamic model to implement the scores of the <monospace>RactIP</monospace> objective function. It is possible to adopt such a hybrid scoring scheme due to the factorization of the posterior probability of a joint structure shown in Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="M3">3</xref>). In fact, prediction accuracy decreased when adopting the identical scoring scheme (e.g. the <monospace>CONTRAfold</monospace> model is used to derive both base-pairing probabilities and hybridization probabilities). The main reason will be that the machine-learning model (<monospace>CONTRAfold</monospace>) specializes in predicting internal secondary structures, whereas the thermodynamic model (<monospace>RNAduplex</monospace>) aims at predicting hybridized structures. Therefore, the approximation enables us to select good models separately and integrate them into the prediction model.</p>
    <p>The results shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> tell us that <monospace>RactIP</monospace> performs worse than <monospace>inRNAs</monospace> and is not significantly better than <monospace>IntaRNA</monospace> on CopA–CopT and OxyS–fhlA pairs with two binding sites. One reason is that lack of interaction data with multiple binding sites makes our method fail to optimize appropriately. Nevertheless, we would like to emphasize again that <monospace>RactIP</monospace> can deal with complex interactions with more than one binding site in the framework of the integer programming formulation. As our future work, optimizing hybridization scores appropriately is necessary to improve prediction performance on the data with multiple binding sites.</p>

    <title>5 CONCLUSION</title>
    <p>We proposed <monospace>RactIP</monospace>, a novel method for predicting RNA–RNA interaction of general type using IP. In our approach, the threshold cut technique was adopted to reduce the complexity of the solution space of the IP problem, which also leads to maximizing expected accuracy. Experimental results on real interaction data demonstrated that prediction accuracy of <monospace>RactIP</monospace> is at least comparable to that of several state-of-the-art methods for joint structure prediction and binding site prediction. Although it is difficult to evaluate theoretically the time complexity of our IP-based approach, experimental validations revealed that <monospace>RactIP</monospace> can run much faster than competitive methods for predicting joint secondary structures. This is an important fact to stress since <monospace>RactIP</monospace> is expected to improve prediction performance in unknown target search in long genomes by predicting respective intramolecular structures as well as intermolecular binding sites in practical time. For this purpose, we should also show that <monospace>RactIP</monospace> can discriminate between targets and non-targets, which is left as our future work. <monospace>RactIP</monospace> not only achieved success in RNA–RNA interaction prediction but also showed further possibility of applying the fast IP-based method with threshold cut to other biologically important problems, which are worthwhile and challenging tasks.</p>
