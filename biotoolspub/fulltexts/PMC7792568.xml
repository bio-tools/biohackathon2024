      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>As a vigorous and hardy and an almost disease-free game bird, the domestic helmeted guinea fowl (<italic>Numida meleagris,</italic> hereafter HGF) has attracted considerable attention in a large number of genetic study projects. However, none of the current/recent avian databases are related to this agriculturally and commercially important poultry species. To address this data gap, we developed Helmeted Guinea Fowl Database (HGFDB), which manages and shares HGF genomic and genetic data. By processing the data of genome assembly, sequencing reads and genetic variations, we organized them into eight modules, which correspond to ‘Home’, ‘Genome’, ‘Re-sequence’, ‘Gene’, ‘Variation’, ‘Download’, ‘Tools’ and ‘Help’, HGFDB provides the most comprehensive view of the HGF genome to date and will be relevant for future studies on HGF structural and functional genomics and genetic improvement.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>The domestic helmeted guinea fowl (<italic>Numida meleagris</italic>, NCBI Taxonomy ID: 8996, hereafter HGF), under the family of Galliformes, is an agriculturally important poultry species. Its domestication is generally recognized to originate from wild HGF in the southern part of the Sahara, particularly in West Africa (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). As a kind of disease-resistant bird with strong adaptability, HGF can thrive in heterogeneous environment and is now reared commercially across continents in Europe, America and Asia. Due to its superior nutritional value and economic potential, the production of HGF is elevated rapidly to about 1.4% of the entire world’s poultry population, of which chicken takes 92.3%, duck takes 4.4% and turkey takes 1.8% (Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical, accessed 2018) (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Besides being a valued source of meat, egg and feather, domestic HGF also serves as a physiological animal model in studying disease (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and neuromuscular, mechanical and energetic strategies for locomotion (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p>
    <p>Although HGF is important, little genetic study has been experimented on it, especially when compared to chicken. Currently, much effort has been taken on exploration of the genetic variation of poultry species, which serves as an important first step to reveal the uniqueness and to identify valuable genetic resources. However, only a handful of papers have been published on genetic diversity of HGF, mainly by microsatellite markers (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) or mtDNA (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). It was not until 2019 that the first draft HGF genome assembly obtained by short sequencing reads was published (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Based on the third-generation long reads, optical and chromatin interaction mapping, our group has improved the HGF reference genome to the near-chromosome level with contig N50 of 68.3 Mb (Peng, M. <italic>et al</italic>., In press). Additionally, we have discovered a tremendous number of single nucleotide polymorphism and InDel markers for 129 re-sequenced samples, which provides a foundation for developing future sustainable genetic improvement and conservation programs.</p>
    <p>Database is a primary source of information that allows users to achieve different research goals within the same dynamic system. Previously, several high-quality avian omics databases have been established, such as BirdBase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://birdbase.arizona.edu/birdbase/">http://birdbase.arizona.edu/birdbase/</ext-link>) (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), Chicken QTLdb (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.animalgenome.org/cgi-bin/QTLdb/GG/index">https://www.animalgenome.org/cgi-bin/QTLdb/GG/index</ext-link>) (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), B10K (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://b10k.genomics.cn/">https://b10k.genomics.cn/</ext-link>) (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and Chicken2K (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://chicken.ynau.edu.cn">http://chicken.ynau.edu.cn</ext-link>) (Peng, M. <italic>et al</italic>., In press). However, none of them are related to guinea fowls. Therefore, It is necessary to fill the data gap for researchers and breeders to use the information more efficiently. Here, we established and developed the first Helmeted Guinea Fowl Database (HGFDB, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hgfdb.ynau.edu.cn/">http://hgfdb.ynau.edu.cn/</ext-link>). It aims to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly data interface for HGF genomic resource to all researchers. The HGFDB provides a high-quality <italic>de novo</italic> genome assembly that approaches to near-chromosome level and 15 173 protein-coding genes (94.73% of which were functional annotated). Moreover, HGFDB offers variants information from 129 genomes embedded in ‘Variation’ search module. We also provide complete statistical report and analysis report for ‘Genome’ and ‘Re-sequence’ sections. The site’s navigation is based on data types. The website now contains prominent links to statics and analysis of genome and re-sequence of HGF. HGFDB provides widely used online tools such as search function, Blast and JBrowse. It is attractive for HGF researchers that HGFDB houses information of publications about HGF-relevant studies. Details about these publications were linked to PubMed (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed</ext-link>) database. Additionally, details of publications from other journals but not presented in PubMed database were manually imported. All data are freely available for download in HGFDB Download page. The HGFDB aims to meet the needs of HGF research community, especially for studies on molecular biology, immune function, growth and overall production performance of HGF.</p>

      <title>Data content</title>
      <p>Based on PacBio long and Illumina short read sequencing together with optical and chromatin interaction mapping, our group has <italic>de novo</italic> assembled a high-quality near-chromosome level genome assembly of the domesticated HGF. Whole-genome re-sequencing on 129 birds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Table S1</xref>) and RNA-seq of 10 tissues (i.e. heart, muscle, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, optic lobe, striatum, cerebral cortex and a mixture of brain tissues) were also carried out (Peng, M. <italic>et al</italic>., In Press). Using this assembly as the reference, genome annotation, variant calling and population genetic analysis were conducted. See the following sections for methods.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s2-s2">
      <title>Genome annotation</title>
      <p>The HGFv1 assembly was annotated for gene content using the NCBI Eukaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Tandem Repeats Finder (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) was used to search for tandem repeats in repeat annotation. We employed EVidence Modeler(<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) to merge RNA sequencing data and protein alignments with gene predictions and homologous method annotation into the final gene set and performed protein alignments using Exonerate (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and tblastn (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) with avian proteomes of <italic>Anas platyrhynchos, Gallus gallus, Meleagris gallopavo</italic> and <italic>Taeniopygia guttata</italic> for protein-coding gene prediction. Protein-coding gene function was assigned according to the best match using Blastp against Swiss-Prot, Translation of EMBL (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The InterProScan functional analysis and Gene Ontology IDs were obtained with InterProScan (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The Gene Ontology enrichment was done with Ontologizer 2.0 (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) with a <italic>P</italic>-value cut-off of 0.05.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s2-s3">
      <title>Variants calling</title>
      <p>For SNPs, the Genome Analysis Toolkit option was set as ‘QD &lt; 4.0, QUAL &lt; 30.0, FS &gt; 60.0, MQ &lt; 40.0, MQRankSum &lt; −10.0, ReadPosRankSum &lt; −7.0, ReadPosRankSum &gt; 7.0, BaseQRankSum &lt; −6.0, BaseQRankSum &gt; 6.0, SOR &gt; 3.0’. Cluster Size and ClusterWindowSize were set to 4 and 10, respectively. For the total variants including SNPs and indels, VCFtools (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) with argument ‘‐ ‐mac 1 ‐ ‐minDP 1 ‐ ‐max-missing 1’ was applied to obtain the final no-missing data set, which included 44 035 924 biallelic SNPs and 4 214 076 indels for 129 individuals.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s2-s4">
      <title>Phylogeny, genetic diversity, singleton, linkage disequilibrium decay and ROHs</title>
      <p>The phylogenetic tree was constructed based on autosomal SNPs using the maximum-likelihood method implemented in FastTree v2 (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The individual ancestry coefficients were calculated by ADMIXTURE v1.3 (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), with K value varying between 2 and 10. According to the Principal Components Analysis and ADMIXTURE results, populations were re-grouped. Furthermore, the comprehensive R package PopGenome (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) was applied to perform population genomic analyses, and the R package SeqVarTools (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) was used to count singletons per individual with countSingletons function. The runs of homozygosity (ROHs) were detected by R package detectRUNS (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) by using the pruned data set to eliminate the impact of strong linkage disequilibrium.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s2-s5">
      <title>Publication data collection</title>
      <p>By using the query in NCBI PubMed: ((((((((((QTL[Title/Abstract]) OR gene[Title/Abstract]) OR genome[Title/Abstract]) OR map[Title/Abstract]) OR microsatellite[Title/Abstract]) OR annotation[Title/Abstract]) OR EST[Title/Abstract]) OR marker[Title/Abstract]) OR sequence[Title/Abstract]) OR GWAS[Title/Abstract]) AND ((guinea fowl [Title/Abstract]) OR Numida meleagris [Title/Abstract]), we imported a total of 548 publications to HGFDB.</p>

    <title>Results</title>
    <p>To organize various types of data and analyze the results, HGFDB is designated into eight main modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The detailed description and function of each module can be found in the following sections.</p>
    <sec id="s3-s1">
      <title>Home</title>
      <p>‘Home’ module offers users an overview of HGFDB and some quick links to common databases, such as NCBI (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), Ensembl (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), Chicken2k, birdbase (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), B10K (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and Chicken QTLdb (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), as well as links to more frequently used tools like quick search of gene information, BLAST and JBrowse. At the bottom of the page, we provide update logs and information of the related projects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

    <title>Conclusion and future plan</title>
    <p>As the first database of HGF, HGFDB is a valuable resource for broad applications to HGF genetics and genomics study. The current implementation of HGFDB integrates data including germplasm information, genome assembly, genomic variation, genes and gene expression, providing a free access for data visualization, search and downloading.</p>
    <p>With the advent of technology and decline of sequencing cost, the number of <italic>de novo</italic> assembly, re-sequencing and other omics studies for HGF is expected to keep increasing in the next few years. Therefore, a continuous effort will be made to ensure a most up-to-date follow-up of the HGF research progress. Future expansion plans of the database include improving the available information, cataloging functional genes, collecting detailed phenotypic data, etc. Development of cross-reference tools to compare data between HGF and other poultry species is also planned as a part of the future database expansion. Beyond this initial release, the overall aim of HGFDB is to provide long-term storage and support of the HGF research data and to provide informatic tools and services for access, data mining and knowledge discovery.</p>
    <p>For the development of HGFDB, we welcome all kinds of comments and suggestions from users and researchers over the world. Through continuous updates, we believe that HGFDB can consequently facilitate and promote studies on HGF, which is an agriculturally and commercially important poultry species.</p>
