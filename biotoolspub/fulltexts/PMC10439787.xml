      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>The prediction of gene structure within the genome sequence is the starting point of genome analysis, and its accuracy has a significant impact on the quality of subsequent analyses. Gene structure prediction is roughly divided into RNA-Seq-based methods, <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic>-based methods, homology-based methods, and the integration of individual prediction methods. Integrated methods are mainstream in recent genome projects because they improve prediction accuracy by combining or taking the best individual prediction findings; however, adequate prediction accuracy for eukaryotic species has not yet been achieved. Therefore, we developed an integrated tool, GINGER, that solves various issues related to gene structure prediction in higher eukaryotes. By handling artefacts in alignments of RNA and protein sequences, reconstructing gene structures via dynamic programming with appropriately weighted and scored exon/intron/intergenic regions, and applying different prediction processes and filtering criteria to multi-exon and single-exon genes, we achieved a significant improvement in accuracy compared to the existing integration methods. The feature of GINGER is its high prediction accuracy at the gene and exon levels, which is pronounced for species with more complex gene architectures. GINGER is implemented using Nextflow, which allows for the efficient and effective use of computing resources.</p>

    <title>1. Introduction</title>
    <p>Advancements in DNA sequencing technology and genome assembly methods have greatly facilitated the acquisition of comprehensive and nearly comprehensive genome sequence data. These data can be utilized to investigate the functions and evolutionary positions of genomes as well as to gain insights into higher-level biological phenomena by integrating omics data. Now that determining the draft genome sequence has been becoming routine, the most critical step involved in the prediction of gene structures that encode proteins that play crucial roles in these phenomena. In the past, large-scale genome projects, such as those of <italic toggle="yes">Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>,<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><italic toggle="yes">Drosophila melanogaster</italic>,<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and <italic toggle="yes">Homo sapiens</italic>,<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> based on first-generation sequencing technology, required significant numbers of personnel and extensive time for genome assembly and annotation, including gene structure determination. However, in recent years, genome projects have continued to be carried out on a small scale, and consequently, gene structure predictions are often performed with limited resources that lack sufficient data, making the task of prediction a formidable bottleneck in the research process. Typically, these predicted gene structures are deposited in public databases alongside functional information derived from additional investigation. However, many of these predictions are insufficient.<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> To accurately examine the biological characteristics of various species through secondary analysis, more precise and efficient annotation techniques are necessary.</p>
    <p>To date, various gene structure prediction methods have been developed and can be broadly classified into four categories: <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic>-based, RNA-Seq-based, homology-based, and integrated methods. <italic toggle="yes">Ab initio</italic>-based methods, such as AUGUSTUS,<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> SNAP,<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and GeneMark,<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> predict gene structures using statistical models trained on highly reliable gene structure annotations from past research. RNA-Seq-based methods, however, utilize sequenced fragment data of mRNA to make predictions. These methods can be further divided into reference-based assembly methods, such as StringTie<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> based on mapping results from HISAT2<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> or STAR,<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic>-based assembly methods, including Trans-ABySS,<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> SOAPdenovo-Trans,<sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Trinity,<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and Oases.<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The former maps fragment sequences to genome sequences and constructs gene structures using position information, whereas the latter assembles fragments and makes spliced alignments against genome sequences. RNA-Seq-based methods are highly reliable because they utilize the mRNA information of the corresponding species, but they are ineffective for genes that are not expressed in the target sites/tissues. Homology-based methods make spliced alignments between the protein sequences of related species and their genome sequences. Examples of such tools include AAT,<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> GeneWise,<sup><xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Exonerate,<sup><xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> genBlastG,<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and Spaln.<sup><xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> These methods are more sensitive than RNA-Seq or <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic>-based methods when protein sequences of closely related species are abundant. However, in the opposite case, many correct predictions may be missed, and predictions cannot be made for genes that are evolutionarily distant and contain unique sequences. Integrated methods, such as MAKER,<sup><xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> EvidenceModeler (EVM),<sup><xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Finder,<sup><xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> and EvidentialGene<sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> integrate the outputs of other prediction methods to reconstruct gene structures as new prediction results. Previous research has demonstrated that this method can produce more comprehensive and accurate gene structures, including those that cannot be predicted by a single method.<sup><xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Although this approach has gained widespread use in genome studies in recent years, it still suffers from the problem of capturing a significant amount of noise because of the large volume of input data and the potential for erroneous predictions. Commonly employed tools, such as MAKER and EVM, have been found to possess high prediction accuracy at the base and exon levels, but not at the gene level. One contributing factor is the high dependency on <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic>-based methods. Prior research has shown that these methods tend to ligate multiple genes (misligation) or the misclassify a single gene as multiple genes (missegmentation).<sup><xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> This can be attributed to the fact that at the time of MAKER and EVM development, RNA-Seq and protein sequence data were not as abundant as they are today. Recent technological advances and research advancements have resulted in the availability of large amounts of RNA-Seq data at low cost, as well as a significant increase in the amount of data registered in public databases, including proteins.<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Therefore, it is worth considering the integration of outputs of <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic>, RNA-Seq, and homology-based methods in a unified manner for more accurate predictions.</p>
    <p>In this paper, we present GINGER, a novel integrated method that aims to address the abovementioned issues and align them with the current research trends.</p>

      <title>2.1. Input data</title>
      <p>In addition to target genome sequence data, GINGER input data consists of RNA-seq data and protein sequence data of closely related species as materials for gene structure prediction. Both genome sequence and protein sequence data were in Multi FASTA format, while RNA-Seq data were in FASTQ format.</p>

    <sec id="s4">
      <title>2.2. Overview of pipeline</title>
      <p>GINGER consists of a preparation phase, in which individual methods are employed to predict gene structures as inputs for the subsequent phase, and a merge phase, in which they are integrated to reconstruct the final gene structures (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). In the latter phase, gene structure predictions for multi-exon and single-exon genes were performed separately. For multi-exon genes, calculations of exon/intron/intergenic scores, grouping of predicted exons from the preparation phase, splitting of groups at unreliable positions, and reconstruction of gene structure for the groups were sequentially performed. At this stage, exons of single-exon gene candidates predicted in the preparation phase were excluded and used for single-exon gene predictions. Conservative selection criteria were applied for these predictions, as it is challenging to increase the sensitivity while avoiding false positives.</p>

      <title>2.3. Preparation phase</title>
      <p>In the preparation phase, gene structure prediction using RNA-Seq-based, <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic>-based, and homology-based methods was performed independently. For RNA-Seq-based methods, a genome-guided assembly-based method and a <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly-based method were employed. The genome-guided assembly-based method first uses HISAT2 to map RNA-Seq reads to genome sequences and then StringTie to predict gene structures from the mapping results. For single-exon genes without strand information, open reading frames (ORFs) were searched for in each frame and the longest ORF was adopted. For multi-exon genes, strand information obtained by StringTie was adopted, and ORFs were extracted using TransDecoder.<sup><xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> The <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly-based method used Trinity and Oases separately to assemble RNA-Seq data, and contigs of 300 bp or more were extracted from their results. Identical sequences were removed using CD-HIT.<sup><xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> The obtained sequences were aligned to the target genome sequences using GMAP,<sup><xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> and gene structures with at least 95% identity were extracted. The results from genome-guided assembly-based method and <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly-based methods were applied to TransDecoder, and the output ORFs of 90 AA or more were the results of the preparation phase.</p>
      <p>In the <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic>-based method, a training dataset was constructed from a random sample of 1,000 gene structures obtained using the genome-guided assembly-based method. Gene structures whose exons overlapped with repetitive sequences searched by the RepeatMasker<sup><xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> program in the genome sequences were removed from the dataset. Note that in GINGER, repetitive sequences do not include low-complexity repeat sequences such as microsatellites or simple repeat sequences. Using this dataset, statistical models of gene structures were trained by Augustus and SNAP, and gene structure prediction was performed using the trained models.</p>
      <p>In the homology-based method, Spaln is used to align the protein sequences of multiple closely related species to their genome sequences. The alignment results in which stop codons exist were removed from the final output.</p>

      <p>where <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">exon</italic></sub> represents the exon potential and <italic toggle="yes">w</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">exon</italic></sub> represents the weight for each method. <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">exon</italic></sub> is a value in the range (0,1] and is calculated for each method (as detailed in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). These exon potential decision schemes were designed to reflect the correlation between the parameter value selected for each prediction method and the accuracy of exon candidates measured from actual nematode, rice, and zebrafish data (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Broadly speaking, RNA-seq-based methods do not show a clear correlation between coverage or identity and exon precision, whereas homology-based methods and <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic>-based methods show a high correlation between identity or score and exon precision, and thus, exon potential decision functions reflecting these trends are established for each method.</p>
      <p>Step 1: Multi-exon gene prediction</p>
      <p>In this step, the gene structures from various prediction methods obtained in the preparation phase are grouped and then merged and reconstructed into a single predicted gene structure within those groups. Overlapping gene structures are grouped based on their genomic positions; however, if there are significantly longer introns, they are subdivided. Every gene structure prediction method used in the preparation phase may produce output results with extremely long introns as artefacts specific to the methods. In GINGER, it is possible to improve the prediction performance and reduce the calculation time by splitting them into subgroups in advance (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). To achieve this idea, base-by-base scores within the target genomic region are calculated. If the score falls below a threshold value, it is reasonable to assume that those low-score regions are not likely to be included as true genes, and the target region is split at that position. The base-by-base scores <italic toggle="yes">s</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">base</italic></sub> are given by the equation:</p>

      <p>Gene structure reconstructions in target genomic regions are performed as optimization problems that seek combinations of merged exons, introns, and intergenic regions that yield the highest score while adhering to constraints that the positional relationship on the genome sequence is not disturbed and that the reading frame consisting of the merged exons is consistent. Dynamic programming was used to solve this problem (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The path score <italic toggle="yes">s</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">path</italic></sub> was calculated as follows: If the <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>th exon was a terminal exon,</p>

      <p>Step 2: Single-exon gene prediction</p>
      <p>Single-exon gene prediction often generates false positives represented by pseudogenes, making it difficult to improve the accuracy compared to multi-exon gene prediction. For single-exon genes, their <italic toggle="yes">s</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">gene</italic></sub> was obtained by summing the <italic toggle="yes">s</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">exon</italic></sub> for exon regions supported by at least two prediction methods. The results were extracted by applying the threshold determined in the multi-exon gene section.</p>

      <title>2.5. Implementation</title>
      <p>GINGER is implemented as executable code in Nextflow, a workflow management system.<sup><xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> This enables efficient utilization of computational resources. In addition to the gene structure prediction method implemented in the Preparation phase of GINGER, there may be methods worth using for reading the results into the Merge phase. Accordingly, a function to import the gene structure prediction results created by the user into GFF and to set their weights is prepared.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s8">
      <title>2.6. User-configurable parameters</title>
      <p>The GINGER system has two user-configurable parameter sets. One set includes the weight coefficients <italic toggle="yes">w</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">exon</italic></sub> for each prediction method in determining the exon score (see <xref rid="M1" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation (1)</xref>), and the other is the threshold for outputting final gene candidates that have <italic toggle="yes">s</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">gene</italic></sub> scores greater than the threshold value. These parameters can be set by the user at the time of GINGER execution, but the default values and automatic determination are set as the default ones, respectively.</p>
      <p>For defaults weight coefficients <italic toggle="yes">w</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">exon</italic></sub>, they were set as follows: 1.6 for the genome-guided assembly-based method, 1.4 for the <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly-based method, 1.8 for the <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic>-based method (Augustus), 1.2 for the <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic>-based method (SNAP), and 2.0 for the homology-based method. These default values were determined as intermediate values between the three sets of parameters (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) optimized to achieve the highest sensitivities using a genetic algorithm for the three model species nematode, rice, and zebrafish (as detailed in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs. S6 and S7</xref>).</p>
      <p>The default threshold value for <italic toggle="yes">s</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">gene</italic></sub> was determined automatically from the distribution of <sub><italic toggle="yes">Sgene</italic></sub> for all the reconstructed gene structures. Analysis of the score distribution using curated genes revealed that gene candidates that formed peaks on the low-score side were mostly false positives. Therefore, a threshold can be set to exclude the peak from the score distribution. <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S8</xref> shows the observation and threshold setting methods.</p>

    <sec id="s9">
      <title>2.7. Benchmark test</title>
      <p>To benchmark GINGER against other tools, we utilized genome sequence, RNA-Seq, and protein sequence data from representative model species, such as nematodes, fruit flies, rice, zebrafish, and humans. Specifically, for nematodes, in addition to the <italic toggle="yes">Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> genome sequence data and RNA-seq data, protein sequence data of <italic toggle="yes">Caenorhabditis briggsae, Pristionchus pacificus, Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Homo sapiens</italic> were used. For fruit flies, in addition to the <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> genome sequence data and RNA-Seq data, protein sequence data of <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila mojavensis, Bombyx mori, C. briggsae</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">H. sapiens</italic> were used. For rice, in addition to the <italic toggle="yes">Oryza sativa</italic> genome sequence data and RNA-Seq data, protein sequence data of <italic toggle="yes">Oryza brachyantha, Panicum hallii, Zea mays</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">H. sapiens</italic> were used. For zebrafish, in addition to the <italic toggle="yes">Danio rerio</italic> genome sequence data and RNA-Seq data, the protein sequence data of <italic toggle="yes">Cyprinus carpio, Oryzias latipes, Takifugu rubripes</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">H. sapiens</italic> were used. For humans, in addition to genome sequence data and RNA-seq data in <italic toggle="yes">H. sapiens</italic>, protein sequences of <italic toggle="yes">Mus musculus, Equus caballus, Canis lupus</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Sus scrofa</italic> were used. All data were downloaded from the NCBI FTP site (see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S3</xref> for more details).</p>
      <p>MAKER and EVM were selected as tools for comparison with GINGER because they have been widely used in recent genomic studies. To ensure fair evaluation as an integrated tool, the same input data produced by the various tools from the preparation phase to GINGER, MAKER, and EVM were utilized. Specifically, the input data for MAKER comprised RNA-Seq assembly results from Trinity, <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic> statistical models learned by Augustus and SNAP, and the same protein sequences used for homology-based predictions in GINGER. For EVM, gene structures obtained through genome-guided assembly-based methods, <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly-based methods, <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic>-based methods (Augustus and SNAP), and homology-based methods were used. (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). In the execution, each parameter was set as follows. For GINGER, all parameters were set to default (default weight coefficients <italic toggle="yes">w</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">exon</italic></sub> and automatically determined thresholds for <sub><italic toggle="yes">Sgene</italic></sub> were used). For EVM, the parameters recommended in the original paper (genome-guided: 1, <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly: 10, Augustus: 0.3, SNAP: 0.3, homology: 1) and those based on GINGER weights (genome-guided: 10, <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly: 4, Augustus: 9, SNAP: 4, homology: 8) were preliminarily tested for several cases. In addition, we also tested two patterns of giving prediction results based on RNA-seq: one is to give the results as they are labelled as ‘TRANSCIPT’ while the other involved applying TransDecoder and presenting the results as ‘OTHER_PREDICTION’. In both cases, the latter approach produced superior results in terms of parameter selection. Furthermore, when considering the manner in which the RNA-seq results were presented, the results obtained with TransDecoder yielded better outcomes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). Therefore, we opted to utilize the TransDecoder results with GINGER-based parameters for the EVM benchmarks. MAKER has no particular parameters to be set and it was executed by default.</p>
      <p>In this benchmark, curated gene structures maintained by each genome consortium were regarded as the ‘correct answers’, and the accuracy of the predictions at the base, exon, and gene levels were evaluated. At the base level, accuracy was evaluated based on the degree to which the correct and predicted exon regions match base-by-base, and at the exon level, it was evaluated to determine whether the ends of the exon region are completely matched; at the gene (transcript) level, whether the exon/intron structures were completely consistent. If isoforms were present, the longest isoforms were used as the correct answers. Sensitivity (Sn), precision (Pr), and F-score were used as evaluation indices. Both sensitivity and precision were obtained using GffCompare<sup><xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> with following options: ‘--strict-match -e 0’.</p>

      <title>3.1. Benchmark results of individual methods in the preparation phase</title>
      <p>First, the results of individual gene prediction tools in the preparation phase are shown in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S6</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>. Basically, we can confirm that both Sn and Pr decrease at the nucleotide level, exon level, and gene level, in that order, in the results of all tools for all species. Among the tools, <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic>-based (Augustus) and genome-guided assembly-based method, recorded the highest F-score for all species. However, the F-score decreased with increasing genome size, and this trend was significantly observed in the prediction performance of Augustus at the gene level. At the exon level, Augustus recorded the highest prediction performance for all species, with only a slight degradation (about 10 points) with increasing genome size, whereas at the gene level, the F-score marked about a 40 point decrease as in zebrafish (1 Gbp) and human (3 Gbp). Among all species cases, <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic> methods yielded average Sn and Pr while the other methods, especially the <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly-based and homology-based methods have higher Sn than Pr. The reason for this is assumed to be that the former does not obtain RNA-seq assembly well in loci where coverage is low. The homology-based approach generally yielded lower Prs, significantly biased toward Sn, and in some cases marked the highest Sn between all prediction methods. This is likely a reflection of the attempt to increase coverage, even if false positives are higher, by including much more distantly related species data as input to the homology-based methods.</p>

      <p>The details of the relationship between exon score and exon prediction performance are shown in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>, where A and B show the relationship between exon potential and Sn and Pv (the higher the exon potential, the higher the Pv), and C and D show the relationship between exon score calculated by applying weight coefficients to the exon potential and Sn and Pv. Since only weights are multiplied, the basic trend does not change, but it can be observed that low coefficients are applied to SNAP and RNA-seq-based methods, for which it is difficult to find a clear correlation between exon prevalence and exon potential. This might be originally ascribed to the low correlation between exon Pv and parameters to determine exon potential (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). That means the discrimination performance between correct and incorrect answers based on exon potential is not high in these tools. These results confirm that the determination concept of exon potential in GINGER and genetic algorithm-based weight coefficients are working correctly.</p>

      <p>As with the results of the individual gene prediction tools, it can be confirmed that both Sn and Pr decrease in the order of base level, exon level, and gene level in the results of all types of integrated tools, and that both Sn and Pr decrease with increasing genome size. Moreover, EVM and GINGER achieved higher F-scores than either of the stand-alone predictions in all species, indicating the effectiveness of the integration. In terms of comparisons between integrated tools, GINGER outperformed the other tools in all species and at all levels of accuracy. In particular, differences in Pr and F-score were large at the exon and gene level, and it was clear that the ratio of correct predictions with GINGER was relatively higher than that of others. This difference widened as genome size increased, from about 7 points of F-score difference at the gene level with EVM, the second-best performer in nematode, to 14–16 points in zebrafish and human. GINGER was notable for its excellent performance in predicting entire gene structures and complete exons. This trend is not a phenomenon that occurs only for the species referenced in the determination of weight coefficients between tools in GINGER but is seen in the pure benchmark fruit flies and human data as exactly the same trend.</p>

      <title>3.3. Comparison of individual predictions with each tool</title>
      <p>GINGER was developed with the aim of improving accuracy at the gene level, and the benchmark results show that it was achieved. To analyze the prediction accuracy of each tool in further detail and capture trends, the overlap of correct answers among the three tools was examined at the base, exon, and gene levels (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). As can be seen from the results, at the base and exon levels, a high percentage of correct bases (67.0%) and exons (50.3%) were predicted by any of the tools, while the accuracy at the gene level was very low (8.8%) for all tools. Similarly, at the base and exon levels, the number of cases where predictions were not made by any of the tools was low (5.1% and 6.3%, respectively), while it reached as high as 36.4% at the gene level. Furthermore, when we examine the prediction results of GINGER and EVM, we find that the percentage of correct predictions shared by both tools is notably high, reaching 86.3% at the base level and 86.2% at the exon level. However, at the gene level, this percentage decreases to 46.9%. These results highlight inconsistencies in gene-level predictions, with GINGER exclusively predicting 10.1% of genes, in contrast to EVM’s solitary prediction of only 3.7% of genes. A detailed analysis of the genes that could be correctly predicted only by GINGER revealed that one of its characteristics to be that in many cases, the first exon was not correctly predicted by the other integration tools. Of the 2,590 genes that only GINGER was able to predict, 1,682 genes were incorrectly predicted by EVM, and 1,871 genes were incorrectly predicted by MAKER for the first exon. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> provides examples of successful predictions made solely by GINGER, where EVM and MAKER failed because of connections between multiple correct gene structures and the inclusion of extra exons. These cases also highlight the significance of proper grouping of gene structures.</p>

      <title>3.4. Benchmark results for GINGER in the case of giving equal exon potential</title>
      <p>For exploring the cause of GINGER’s high predictive performance, we ran benchmark tests that cut off the function to calculate exon potential depending on various statistical parameters. Specifically, we set the exon potential of all inputs to 1.0. The results are shown in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S7</xref>. Compared to GINGER using the default values, the prediction performance is reduced for all species, with 2.2–3.6 and 3.2–8.5 point reductions in F-score for exon level and gene level, respectively. This result suggests that the exon potential based on the statistical parameters set for each prediction tool is responsible for GINGER’s high performance.</p>
    </sec>

  <sec id="s15">
    <title>4. Discussion</title>
    <p>We successfully developed a novel integrated gene structure prediction tool, GINGER, for higher eukaryotic species. As shown above, the benchmark test utilizing a wide range of species indicated that GINGER outperformed other integration-based gene prediction tools, particularly at the gene and exon levels. We were also able to show from the analysis of the predicted results comparison and some additional benchmark tests why GINGER is able to achieve high performance. Because of the complex interplay of various functions and parameters, it is difficult to clearly show which functions are directly related to the high performance, but we were able to identify that some GINGER-specific functions are likely responsible for the overall effect.</p>
    <p>The first one is the subgrouping function for determining gene regions from predicted exons. From the analysis of genes that could be predicted only with GINGER, we found that the ratio of correctly predicted first exons was higher than with other integration tools, as well as gene predictions that resulted in an appropriate number of exons per gene. In fact, in the overall zebrafish benchmark results, the number of cases where multiple genes were fused was 627 for GINGER, compared to 1,232 for EVM and 1,254 for MAKER. This data also confirms the contribution of the subgroup function in GINGER to the high prediction performance.</p>
    <p>The next feature that might be contributing GINGER’s high prediction performance is the exon potential given for each exon. In GINGER, for each prediction tool, the exon potential is based on statistical parameters such as the identity between the protein sequence used for prediction and the target genome. In EVM, a score is given for the category of each method, but not for each predicted exon. It is directly shown that GINGER’s exon potential is correlated with the exon prevalence, but it is also shown to contribute to the final predicted results, as the benchmark test with the same exon potentials worsened the results. It is assumed that GINGER’s high performance is achieved by the combination of these functions.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, the original EVM paper obtained better results in benchmarking with the same species (rice, human) as this paper. However, this might be largely due to the difference in the genomic data used. For example, for rice, EVM was applied to extracted genes and the flanking 30 kb region from the genome. In contrast, when the whole genome is used, as is in this paper, the performance is naturally inferior to that of the benchmark applied only to the genomic region around the gene, which is also a more realistic benchmark and closer to the actual problem.</p>
    <p>However, there is still potential for development. GINGER was designed to achieve high prediction accuracy for draft genomes; however, it is challenging to obtain accurate alignments in the presence of gaps in the gene regions. Although the number of draft genome sequences consisting of numerous small fragments is declining as genome assembly using long-read technologies represented by Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencers has become more mainstream, completely eliminating assembly errors remains a challenge. To resolve the problem of missing regions of a gene in the genome due to gaps or misassemblies, GINGER currently handles it by detecting extremely long introns in the merge phase, step 1. However, in terms of fundamental resolution and portability, it is preferable to address this issue during the preparation phase by improving alignment tools or improving pre- and/or post-processing. Slightly different from the issue of the integration tool itself, achieving even more accurate alignment of mRNA/protein sequences with genome sequences will also be an issue to be addressed in the future. For example, it may be possible to obtain a more accurate alignment by paying close attention to the maximum intron length. By using appropriate settings for each species, it is possible to avoid long introns due to artefacts and avoid predicted gene fusions. Furthermore, in addition to the tools mentioned in this paper, new alignment tools have appeared even in recent years, for example, miniprot.<sup><xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> The use of these tools may help solve the problem. We recognize that there are many tools worth considering for incorporation in GINGER, including alignment tools and <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic> methodology tools such as GeneMark. Incorporating new tools into the preparation phase of GINGER requires pre- and post-processing and performance tuning, warranting caution. Therefore, here, we provide a function to import structure prediction results by GFF and a function to set their weights. In future versions, we would like to start by considering support for other tools. Finally, it is considered useful to predict the gene structures of higher eukaryotes given the presence of various isoforms. RNA-Seq-based methods typically predict the gene structures of isoforms, and an integrated method such as FINDER enables this prediction. In GINGER, suboptimal solutions of gene structures from the merge phase, step 1, can serve as candidates, and the results from RNA-Seq-based methods can support these candidates as output. Alternatively, it may be possible to address the isoform issue by using the prediction output from a tool such as GINGER as input for a tool such as PASA.<sup><xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Although there are still many issues that need to be addressed, there are many genes that have been correctly predicted only by GINGER. Another feature of GINGER is the efficient use of computer resources in Nextflow. MAKER, which is widely used, requires an extremely large amount of computing time, and unfortunately, benchmarking against the human genome cannot be completed in two months. In contrast, GINGER requires less than one day to perform the merge phase. From these points of view, GINGER is expected to be very useful as a stand-alone tool or at least as a complementary tool to other gene prediction methods.</p>

      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>The prediction of gene structure within the genome sequence is the starting point of genome analysis, and its accuracy has a significant impact on the quality of subsequent analyses. Gene structure prediction is roughly divided into RNA-Seq-based methods, <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic>-based methods, homology-based methods, and the integration of individual prediction methods. Integrated methods are mainstream in recent genome projects because they improve prediction accuracy by combining or taking the best individual prediction findings; however, adequate prediction accuracy for eukaryotic species has not yet been achieved. Therefore, we developed an integrated tool, GINGER, that solves various issues related to gene structure prediction in higher eukaryotes. By handling artefacts in alignments of RNA and protein sequences, reconstructing gene structures via dynamic programming with appropriately weighted and scored exon/intron/intergenic regions, and applying different prediction processes and filtering criteria to multi-exon and single-exon genes, we achieved a significant improvement in accuracy compared to the existing integration methods. The feature of GINGER is its high prediction accuracy at the gene and exon levels, which is pronounced for species with more complex gene architectures.

    <title>1. Introduction</title>
    <p>Advancements in DNA sequencing technology and genome assembly methods have greatly facilitated the acquisition of comprehensive and nearly comprehensive genome sequence data. These data can be utilized to investigate the functions and evolutionary positions of genomes as well as to gain insights into higher-level biological phenomena by integrating omics data. Now that determining the draft genome sequence has been becoming routine, the most critical step involved in the prediction of gene structures that encode proteins that play crucial roles in these phenomena. In the past, large-scale genome projects, such as those of <italic toggle="yes">Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>,<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><italic toggle="yes">Drosophila melanogaster</italic>,<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and <italic toggle="yes">Homo sapiens</italic>,<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> based on first-generation sequencing technology, required significant numbers of personnel and extensive time for genome assembly and annotation, including gene structure determination. However, in recent years, genome projects have continued to be carried out on a small scale, and consequently, gene structure predictions are often performed with limited resources that lack sufficient data, making the task of prediction a formidable bottleneck in the research process. Typically, these predicted gene structures are deposited in public databases alongside functional information derived from additional investigation. However, many of these predictions are insufficient.<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> To accurately examine the biological characteristics of various species through secondary analysis, more precise and efficient annotation techniques are necessary.</p>
    <p>To date, various gene structure prediction methods have been developed and can be broadly classified into four categories: <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic>-based, RNA-Seq-based, homology-based, and integrated methods. <italic toggle="yes">Ab initio</italic>-based methods, such as AUGUSTUS,<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> SNAP,<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and GeneMark,<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> predict gene structures using statistical models trained on highly reliable gene structure annotations from past research. RNA-Seq-based methods, however, utilize sequenced fragment data of mRNA to make predictions. These methods can be further divided into reference-based assembly methods, such as StringTie<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> based on mapping results from HISAT2<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> or STAR,<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic>-based assembly methods, including Trans-ABySS,<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> SOAPdenovo-Trans,<sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Trinity,<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and Oases.<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The former maps fragment sequences to genome sequences and constructs gene structures using position information, whereas the latter assembles fragments and makes spliced alignments against genome sequences. RNA-Seq-based methods are highly reliable because they utilize the mRNA information of the corresponding species, but they are ineffective for genes that are not expressed in the target sites/tissues. Homology-based methods make spliced alignments between the protein sequences of related species and their genome sequences. Examples of such tools include AAT,<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> GeneWise,<sup><xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Exonerate,<sup><xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> genBlastG,<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and Spaln.<sup><xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> These methods are more sensitive than RNA-Seq or <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic>-based methods when protein sequences of closely related species are abundant. However, in the opposite case, many correct predictions may be missed, and predictions cannot be made for genes that are evolutionarily distant and contain unique sequences. Integrated methods, such as MAKER,<sup><xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> EvidenceModeler (EVM),<sup><xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Finder,<sup><xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> and EvidentialGene<sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> integrate the outputs of other prediction methods to reconstruct gene structures as new prediction results. Previous research has demonstrated that this method can produce more comprehensive and accurate gene structures, including those that cannot be predicted by a single method.<sup><xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Although this approach has gained widespread use in genome studies in recent years, it still suffers from the problem of capturing a significant amount of noise because of the large volume of input data and the potential for erroneous predictions. Commonly employed tools, such as MAKER and EVM, have been found to possess high prediction accuracy at the base and exon levels, but not at the gene level. One contributing factor is the high dependency on <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic>-based methods. Prior research has shown that these methods tend to ligate multiple genes (misligation) or the misclassify a single gene as multiple genes (missegmentation).<sup><xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> This can be attributed to the fact that at the time of MAKER and EVM development, RNA-Seq and protein sequence data were not as abundant as they are today. Recent technological advances and research advancements have resulted in the availability of large amounts of RNA-Seq data at low cost, as well as a significant increase in the amount of data registered in public databases, including proteins.<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Therefore, it is worth considering the integration of outputs of <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic>, RNA-Seq, and homology-based methods in a unified manner for more accurate predictions.</p>
    <p>In this paper, we present GINGER, a novel integrated method that aims to address the abovementioned issues and align them with the current research trends.</p>

      <p>In addition to target genome sequence data, GINGER input data consists of RNA-seq data and protein sequence data of closely related species as materials for gene structure prediction. Both genome sequence and protein sequence data were in Multi FASTA format, while RNA-Seq data were in FASTQ format.</p>

      <title>2.2. Overview of pipeline</title>
      <p>GINGER consists of a preparation phase, in which individual methods are employed to predict gene structures as inputs for the subsequent phase, and a merge phase, in which they are integrated to reconstruct the final gene structures (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). In the latter phase, gene structure predictions for multi-exon and single-exon genes were performed separately. For multi-exon genes, calculations of exon/intron/intergenic scores, grouping of predicted exons from the preparation phase, splitting of groups at unreliable positions, and reconstruction of gene structure for the groups were sequentially performed. At this stage, exons of single-exon gene candidates predicted in the preparation phase were excluded and used for single-exon gene predictions. Conservative selection criteria were applied for these predictions, as it is challenging to increase the sensitivity while avoiding false positives.</p>

      <title>2.3. Preparation phase</title>
      <p>In the preparation phase, gene structure prediction using RNA-Seq-based, <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic>-based, and homology-based methods was performed independently. For RNA-Seq-based methods, a genome-guided assembly-based method and a <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly-based method were employed. The genome-guided assembly-based method first uses HISAT2 to map RNA-Seq reads to genome sequences and then StringTie to predict gene structures from the mapping results. For single-exon genes without strand information, open reading frames (ORFs) were searched for in each frame and the longest ORF was adopted. For multi-exon genes, strand information obtained by StringTie was adopted, and ORFs were extracted using TransDecoder.<sup><xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> The <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly-based method used Trinity and Oases separately to assemble RNA-Seq data, and contigs of 300 bp or more were extracted from their results. Identical sequences were removed using CD-HIT.<sup><xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> The obtained sequences were aligned to the target genome sequences using GMAP,<sup><xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> and gene structures with at least 95% identity were extracted. The results from genome-guided assembly-based method and <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly-based methods were applied to TransDecoder, and the output ORFs of 90 AA or more were the results of the preparation phase.</p>
      <p>In the <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic>-based method, a training dataset was constructed from a random sample of 1,000 gene structures obtained using the genome-guided assembly-based method. Gene structures whose exons overlapped with repetitive sequences searched by the RepeatMasker<sup><xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> program in the genome sequences were removed from the dataset. Note that in GINGER, repetitive sequences do not include low-complexity repeat sequences such as microsatellites or simple repeat sequences. Using this dataset, statistical models of gene structures were trained by Augustus and SNAP, and gene structure prediction was performed using the trained models.</p>
      <p>In the homology-based method, Spaln is used to align the protein sequences of multiple closely related species to their genome sequences. The alignment results in which stop codons exist were removed from the final output.</p>

These exon potential decision schemes were designed to reflect the correlation between the parameter value selected for each prediction method and the accuracy of exon candidates measured from actual nematode, rice, and zebrafish data (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Broadly speaking, RNA-seq-based methods do not show a clear correlation between coverage or identity and exon precision, whereas homology-based methods and <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic>-based methods show a high correlation between identity or score and exon precision, and thus, exon potential decision functions reflecting these trends are established for each method.</p>
      <p>Step 1: Multi-exon gene prediction</p>
      <p>In this step, the gene structures from various prediction methods obtained in the preparation phase are grouped and then merged and reconstructed into a single predicted gene structure within those groups. Overlapping gene structures are grouped based on their genomic positions; however, if there are significantly longer introns, they are subdivided. Every gene structure prediction method used in the preparation phase may produce output results with extremely long introns as artefacts specific to the methods. In GINGER, it is possible to improve the prediction performance and reduce the calculation time by splitting them into subgroups in advance (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). To achieve this idea, base-by-base scores within the target genomic region are calculated. If the score falls below a threshold value, it is reasonable to assume that those low-score regions are not likely to be included as true genes, and the target region is split at that position. The base-by-base scores <italic toggle="yes">s</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">base</italic></sub> are given by the equation:</p>

      <p>In addition, the target groups are split according to unusually long introns that cannot be addressed by the abovementioned conditions. A specific cause of artefacts is that an extremely long intron is sandwiched to align the terminal exons of several bases. Another study reported that intron length could be fitted with a convolution of one to three extreme values or lognormal distributions.<sup><xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> In GINGER, the upper limit of intron length is determined from the intron length distribution of the gene structure prediction results obtained in the preparation phase, and the grouped gene structures are split into subgroups using this information. <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures S2 and S3</xref> show the distribution of intron lengths obtained from the curated gene structures and the detailed method for determining the critical intron length.</p>

      <p>Gene structure reconstructions in target genomic regions are performed as optimization problems that seek combinations of merged exons, introns, and intergenic regions that yield the highest score while adhering to constraints that the positional relationship on the genome sequence is not disturbed and that the reading frame consisting of the merged exons is consistent. Dynamic programming was used to solve this problem (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The path score <italic toggle="yes">s</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">path</italic></sub> was calculated as follows: If the <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>th exon was a terminal exon,</p>

      <p>Step 2: Single-exon gene prediction</p>
      <p>Single-exon gene prediction often generates false positives represented by pseudogenes, making it difficult to improve the accuracy compared to multi-exon gene prediction. For single-exon genes, their <italic toggle="yes">s</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">gene</italic></sub> was obtained by summing the <italic toggle="yes">s</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">exon</italic></sub> for exon regions supported by at least two prediction methods.

      <p>GINGER is implemented as executable code in Nextflow, a workflow management system.<sup><xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> This enables efficient utilization of computational resources. In addition to the gene structure prediction method implemented in the Preparation phase of GINGER, there may be methods worth using for reading the results into the Merge phase. Accordingly, a function to import the gene structure prediction results created by the user into GFF and to set their weights is prepared.</p>

      <title>2.6. User-configurable parameters</title>
      <p>The GINGER system has two user-configurable parameter sets. One set includes the weight coefficients <italic toggle="yes">w</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">exon</italic></sub> for each prediction method in determining the exon score (see <xref rid="M1" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation (1)</xref>), and the other is the threshold for outputting final gene candidates that have <italic toggle="yes">s</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">gene</italic></sub> scores greater than the threshold value. These parameters can be set by the user at the time of GINGER execution, but the default values and automatic determination are set as the default ones, respectively.</p>
      <p>For defaults weight coefficients <italic toggle="yes">w</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">exon</italic></sub>, they were set as follows: 1.6 for the genome-guided assembly-based method, 1.4 for the <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly-based method, 1.8 for the <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic>-based method (Augustus), 1.2 for the <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic>-based method (SNAP), and 2.0 for the homology-based method. These default values were determined as intermediate values between the three sets of parameters (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) optimized to achieve the highest sensitivities using a genetic algorithm for the three model species nematode, rice, and zebrafish (as detailed in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs. S6 and S7</xref>).</p>
      <p>The default threshold value for <italic toggle="yes">s</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">gene</italic></sub> was determined automatically from the distribution of <sub><italic toggle="yes">Sgene</italic></sub> for all the reconstructed gene structures. Analysis of the score distribution using curated genes revealed that gene candidates that formed peaks on the low-score side were mostly false positives. Therefore, a threshold can be set to exclude the peak from the score distribution. <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S8</xref> shows the observation and threshold setting methods.</p>

    <sec id="s9">
      <title>2.7. Benchmark test</title>
      <p>To benchmark GINGER against other tools, we utilized genome sequence, RNA-Seq, and protein sequence data from representative model species, such as nematodes, fruit flies, rice, zebrafish, and humans. Specifically, for nematodes, in addition to the <italic toggle="yes">Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> genome sequence data and RNA-seq data, protein sequence data of <italic toggle="yes">Caenorhabditis briggsae, Pristionchus pacificus, Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Homo sapiens</italic> were used. For fruit flies, in addition to the <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> genome sequence data and RNA-Seq data, protein sequence data of <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila mojavensis, Bombyx mori, C. briggsae</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">H. sapiens</italic> were used. For rice, in addition to the <italic toggle="yes">Oryza sativa</italic> genome sequence data and RNA-Seq data, protein sequence data of <italic toggle="yes">Oryza brachyantha, Panicum hallii, Zea mays</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">H. sapiens</italic> were used. For zebrafish, in addition to the <italic toggle="yes">Danio rerio</italic> genome sequence data and RNA-Seq data, the protein sequence data of <italic toggle="yes">Cyprinus carpio, Oryzias latipes, Takifugu rubripes</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">H. sapiens</italic> were used. For humans, in addition to genome sequence data and RNA-seq data in <italic toggle="yes">H. sapiens</italic>, protein sequences of <italic toggle="yes">Mus musculus, Equus caballus, Canis lupus</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Sus scrofa</italic> were used. All data were downloaded from the NCBI FTP site (see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S3</xref> for more details).</p>
      <p>MAKER and EVM were selected as tools for comparison with GINGER because they have been widely used in recent genomic studies. To ensure fair evaluation as an integrated tool, the same input data produced by the various tools from the preparation phase to GINGER, MAKER, and EVM were utilized. Specifically, the input data for MAKER comprised RNA-Seq assembly results from Trinity, <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic> statistical models learned by Augustus and SNAP, and the same protein sequences used for homology-based predictions in GINGER. For EVM, gene structures obtained through genome-guided assembly-based methods, <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly-based methods, <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic>-based methods (Augustus and SNAP), and homology-based methods were used. (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). In the execution, each parameter was set as follows. For GINGER, all parameters were set to default (default weight coefficients <italic toggle="yes">w</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">exon</italic></sub> and automatically determined thresholds for <sub><italic toggle="yes">Sgene</italic></sub> were used). For EVM, the parameters recommended in the original paper (genome-guided: 1, <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly: 10, Augustus: 0.3, SNAP: 0.3, homology: 1) and those based on GINGER weights (genome-guided: 10, <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly: 4, Augustus: 9, SNAP: 4, homology: 8) were preliminarily tested for several cases. In addition, we also tested two patterns of giving prediction results based on RNA-seq: one is to give the results as they are labelled as ‘TRANSCIPT’ while the other involved applying TransDecoder and presenting the results as ‘OTHER_PREDICTION’. In both cases, the latter approach produced superior results in terms of parameter selection. Furthermore, when considering the manner in which the RNA-seq results were presented, the results obtained with TransDecoder yielded better outcomes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). Therefore, we opted to utilize the TransDecoder results with GINGER-based parameters for the EVM benchmarks. MAKER has no particular parameters to be set and it was executed by default.</p>
      <p>In this benchmark, curated gene structures maintained by each genome consortium were regarded as the ‘correct answers’, and the accuracy of the predictions at the base, exon, and gene levels were evaluated. At the base level, accuracy was evaluated based on the degree to which the correct and predicted exon regions match base-by-base, and at the exon level, it was evaluated to determine whether the ends of the exon region are completely matched; at the gene (transcript) level, whether the exon/intron structures were completely consistent. If isoforms were present, the longest isoforms were used as the correct answers. Sensitivity (Sn), precision (Pr), and F-score were used as evaluation indices. Both sensitivity and precision were obtained using GffCompare<sup><xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> with following options: ‘--strict-match -e 0’.</p>

      <title>3.1. Benchmark results of individual methods in the preparation phase</title>
      <p>First, the results of individual gene prediction tools in the preparation phase are shown in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S6</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>. Basically, we can confirm that both Sn and Pr decrease at the nucleotide level, exon level, and gene level, in that order, in the results of all tools for all species. Among the tools, <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic>-based (Augustus) and genome-guided assembly-based method, recorded the highest F-score for all species. However, the F-score decreased with increasing genome size, and this trend was significantly observed in the prediction performance of Augustus at the gene level. At the exon level, Augustus recorded the highest prediction performance for all species, with only a slight degradation (about 10 points) with increasing genome size, whereas at the gene level, the F-score marked about a 40 point decrease as in zebrafish (1 Gbp) and human (3 Gbp). Among all species cases, <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic> methods yielded average Sn and Pr while the other methods, especially the <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly-based and homology-based methods have higher Sn than Pr. The reason for this is assumed to be that the former does not obtain RNA-seq assembly well in loci where coverage is low. The homology-based approach generally yielded lower Prs, significantly biased toward Sn, and in some cases marked the highest Sn between all prediction methods. This is likely a reflection of the attempt to increase coverage, even if false positives are higher, by including much more distantly related species data as input to the homology-based methods.</p>

      <p>The details of the relationship between exon score and exon prediction performance are shown in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>, where A and B show the relationship between exon potential and Sn and Pv (the higher the exon potential, the higher the Pv), and C and D show the relationship between exon score calculated by applying weight coefficients to the exon potential and Sn and Pv. Since only weights are multiplied, the basic trend does not change, but it can be observed that low coefficients are applied to SNAP and RNA-seq-based methods, for which it is difficult to find a clear correlation between exon prevalence and exon potential. This might be originally ascribed to the low correlation between exon Pv and parameters to determine exon potential (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). That means the discrimination performance between correct and incorrect answers based on exon potential is not high in these tools. These results confirm that the determination concept of exon potential in GINGER and genetic algorithm-based weight coefficients are working correctly.</p>

      <p>As with the results of the individual gene prediction tools, it can be confirmed that both Sn and Pr decrease in the order of base level, exon level, and gene level in the results of all types of integrated tools, and that both Sn and Pr decrease with increasing genome size. Moreover, EVM and GINGER achieved higher F-scores than either of the stand-alone predictions in all species, indicating the effectiveness of the integration. In terms of comparisons between integrated tools, GINGER outperformed the other tools in all species and at all levels of accuracy. In particular, differences in Pr and F-score were large at the exon and gene level, and it was clear that the ratio of correct predictions with GINGER was relatively higher than that of others. This difference widened as genome size increased, from about 7 points of F-score difference at the gene level with EVM, the second-best performer in nematode, to 14–16 points in zebrafish and human. GINGER was notable for its excellent performance in predicting entire gene structures and complete exons. This trend is not a phenomenon that occurs only for the species referenced in the determination of weight coefficients between tools in GINGER but is seen in the pure benchmark fruit flies and human data as exactly the same trend.</p>

      <title>3.3. Comparison of individual predictions with each tool</title>
      <p>GINGER was developed with the aim of improving accuracy at the gene level, and the benchmark results show that it was achieved. To analyze the prediction accuracy of each tool in further detail and capture trends, the overlap of correct answers among the three tools was examined at the base, exon, and gene levels (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). As can be seen from the results, at the base and exon levels, a high percentage of correct bases (67.0%) and exons (50.3%) were predicted by any of the tools, while the accuracy at the gene level was very low (8.8%) for all tools. Similarly, at the base and exon levels, the number of cases where predictions were not made by any of the tools was low (5.1% and 6.3%, respectively), while it reached as high as 36.4% at the gene level. Furthermore, when we examine the prediction results of GINGER and EVM, we find that the percentage of correct predictions shared by both tools is notably high, reaching 86.3% at the base level and 86.2% at the exon level. However, at the gene level, this percentage decreases to 46.9%. These results highlight inconsistencies in gene-level predictions, with GINGER exclusively predicting 10.1% of genes, in contrast to EVM’s solitary prediction of only 3.7% of genes. A detailed analysis of the genes that could be correctly predicted only by GINGER revealed that one of its characteristics to be that in many cases, the first exon was not correctly predicted by the other integration tools. Of the 2,590 genes that only GINGER was able to predict, 1,682 genes were incorrectly predicted by EVM, and 1,871 genes were incorrectly predicted by MAKER for the first exon. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> provides examples of successful predictions made solely by GINGER, where EVM and MAKER failed because of connections between multiple correct gene structures and the inclusion of extra exons. These cases also highlight the significance of proper grouping of gene structures.</p>

      <title>3.4. Benchmark results for GINGER in the case of giving equal exon potential</title>
      <p>For exploring the cause of GINGER’s high predictive performance, we ran benchmark tests that cut off the function to calculate exon potential depending on various statistical parameters. Specifically, we set the exon potential of all inputs to 1.0. The results are shown in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S7</xref>. Compared to GINGER using the default values, the prediction performance is reduced for all species, with 2.2–3.6 and 3.2–8.5 point reductions in F-score for exon level and gene level, respectively. This result suggests that the exon potential based on the statistical parameters set for each prediction tool is responsible for GINGER’s high performance.</p>
    </sec>
  </sec>
  <sec id="s15">
    <title>4. Discussion</title>
    <p>We successfully developed a novel integrated gene structure prediction tool, GINGER, for higher eukaryotic species. As shown above, the benchmark test utilizing a wide range of species indicated that GINGER outperformed other integration-based gene prediction tools, particularly at the gene and exon levels. We were also able to show from the analysis of the predicted results comparison and some additional benchmark tests why GINGER is able to achieve high performance. Because of the complex interplay of various functions and parameters, it is difficult to clearly show which functions are directly related to the high performance, but we were able to identify that some GINGER-specific functions are likely responsible for the overall effect.</p>
    <p>The first one is the subgrouping function for determining gene regions from predicted exons. From the analysis of genes that could be predicted only with GINGER, we found that the ratio of correctly predicted first exons was higher than with other integration tools, as well as gene predictions that resulted in an appropriate number of exons per gene. In fact, in the overall zebrafish benchmark results, the number of cases where multiple genes were fused was 627 for GINGER, compared to 1,232 for EVM and 1,254 for MAKER. This data also confirms the contribution of the subgroup function in GINGER to the high prediction performance.</p>
    <p>The next feature that might be contributing GINGER’s high prediction performance is the exon potential given for each exon. In GINGER, for each prediction tool, the exon potential is based on statistical parameters such as the identity between the protein sequence used for prediction and the target genome. In EVM, a score is given for the category of each method, but not for each predicted exon. It is directly shown that GINGER’s exon potential is correlated with the exon prevalence, but it is also shown to contribute to the final predicted results, as the benchmark test with the same exon potentials worsened the results. It is assumed that GINGER’s high performance is achieved by the combination of these functions.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, the original EVM paper obtained better results in benchmarking with the same species (rice, human) as this paper. However, this might be largely due to the difference in the genomic data used. For example, for rice, EVM was applied to extracted genes and the flanking 30 kb region from the genome. In contrast, when the whole genome is used, as is in this paper, the performance is naturally inferior to that of the benchmark applied only to the genomic region around the gene, which is also a more realistic benchmark and closer to the actual problem.</p>
    <p>However, there is still potential for development. GINGER was designed to achieve high prediction accuracy for draft genomes; however, it is challenging to obtain accurate alignments in the presence of gaps in the gene regions. Although the number of draft genome sequences consisting of numerous small fragments is declining as genome assembly using long-read technologies represented by Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencers has become more mainstream, completely eliminating assembly errors remains a challenge. To resolve the problem of missing regions of a gene in the genome due to gaps or misassemblies, GINGER currently handles it by detecting extremely long introns in the merge phase, step 1. However, in terms of fundamental resolution and portability, it is preferable to address this issue during the preparation phase by improving alignment tools or improving pre- and/or post-processing. Slightly different from the issue of the integration tool itself, achieving even more accurate alignment of mRNA/protein sequences with genome sequences will also be an issue to be addressed in the future. For example, it may be possible to obtain a more accurate alignment by paying close attention to the maximum intron length. By using appropriate settings for each species, it is possible to avoid long introns due to artefacts and avoid predicted gene fusions. Furthermore, in addition to the tools mentioned in this paper, new alignment tools have appeared even in recent years, for example, miniprot.<sup><xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> The use of these tools may help solve the problem. We recognize that there are many tools worth considering for incorporation in GINGER, including alignment tools and <italic toggle="yes">ab initio</italic> methodology tools such as GeneMark. Incorporating new tools into the preparation phase of GINGER requires pre- and post-processing and performance tuning, warranting caution. Therefore, here, we provide a function to import structure prediction results by GFF and a function to set their weights. In future versions, we would like to start by considering support for other tools. Finally, it is considered useful to predict the gene structures of higher eukaryotes given the presence of various isoforms. RNA-Seq-based methods typically predict the gene structures of isoforms, and an integrated method such as FINDER enables this prediction. In GINGER, suboptimal solutions of gene structures from the merge phase, step 1, can serve as candidates, and the results from RNA-Seq-based methods can support these candidates as output. Alternatively, it may be possible to address the isoform issue by using the prediction output from a tool such as GINGER as input for a tool such as PASA.<sup><xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Although there are still many issues that need to be addressed, there are many genes that have been correctly predicted only by GINGER. Another feature of GINGER is the efficient use of computer resources in Nextflow. MAKER, which is widely used, requires an extremely large amount of computing time, and unfortunately, benchmarking against the human genome cannot be completed in two months. In contrast, GINGER requires less than one day to perform the merge phase. From these points of view, GINGER is expected to be very useful as a stand-alone tool or at least as a complementary tool to other gene prediction methods.</p>
