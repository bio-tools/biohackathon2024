        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>MyelinJ is a free user friendly ImageJ macro for high throughput analysis of fluorescent micrographs such as 2D-myelinating cultures and statistical analysis using R. MyelinJ can analyse single images or complex experiments with multiple conditions, where the ggpubr package in R is automatically used for statistical analysis and the production of publication quality graphs. The main outputs are percentage (%) neurite density and % myelination. % neurite density is calculated using the normalize local contrast algorithm, followed by thresholding, to adjust for differences in intensity. For % myelination the myelin sheaths are selected using the Frangi vesselness algorithm, in conjunction with a grey scale morphology filter and the removal of cell bodies using a high intensity mask. MyelinJ uses a simple graphical user interface and user name system for reproducibility and sharing that will be useful to the wider scientific community that study 2D-myelination <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>Myelin is an essential component of the central nervous system (CNS) and its degeneration is associated with spinal cord injury and several CNS diseases, most notably multiple sclerosis (<xref rid="btz403-B3" ref-type="bibr">Goldenberg, 2012</xref>). Myelinating cultures generated from dissociated embryonic rodent spinal cords have been developed (<xref rid="btz403-B6" ref-type="bibr">Kerman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="btz403-B11" ref-type="bibr">Pang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="btz403-B14" ref-type="bibr">Sorensen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="btz403-B15" ref-type="bibr">Thomson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) as a tool to study developmental myelination (<xref rid="btz403-B5" ref-type="bibr">Ioannidou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), characteristics of spinal cord injury (<xref rid="btz403-B2" ref-type="bibr">Boomkamp <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) and demyelination (<xref rid="btz403-B8" ref-type="bibr">Lindner and Linington, 2016</xref>). Consequently, myelinating cultures can be used as a high throughput screen for potential therapeutics that promote (re)myelination (<xref rid="btz403-B9" ref-type="bibr">McCanney <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>, <xref rid="btz403-B10" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). One of the main bottlenecks for these screens is the accurate high throughput quantification of myelin sheaths. Currently, only a CellProfiler pipeline is freely available for analysis of <italic>in vitro</italic> myelination (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/muecs/cp">https://github.com/muecs/cp</ext-link>). The MyelinJ ImageJ plugin we have developed is a freely available ImageJ (<xref rid="btz403-B13" ref-type="bibr">Schindelin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) macro that allows for high throughput analysis of individual experiments or large studies. The macro produces the percentage (%) of myelination and the % of neurite density for each image and links to R (<xref rid="btz403-B12" ref-type="bibr">R Core Team, 2013</xref>) for automated statistical analysis and graph production. The user friendly graphical user interface (GUI) and username system support reproducibility and sharing. MyelinJ aims to be widely applicable to the neuroscience community, because the settings can be easily adjusted/optimized specifically for your experiment. This study has only tested MyelinJ using myelinating cultures, however it is likely to also be useful for analysing slice cultures (<xref rid="btz403-B4" ref-type="bibr">Hill <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) and tissue sections.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec>
    <title>2 Materials and methods</title>
    <p>Myelinating cultures were made according to <xref rid="btz403-B14" ref-type="bibr">Sorensen <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref>, demyelinated as described in <xref rid="btz403-B10" ref-type="bibr">McCanney <italic>et al.</italic> (2019)</xref> and manual analysis of micrographs was performed according to <xref rid="btz403-B14" ref-type="bibr">Sorensen <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref>. MyelinJ analyses % myelination and % neurite density of 2D fluorescent micrographs.</p>
    <sec>
      <title>2.1 Background subtraction</title>
      <p>Background is first subtracted either using ImageJ’s ‘rolling ball’ background subtraction, or using the neurite image as a mask to remove any bleed through of neurite fluorescence, followed by subtraction of pixels below a user provided threshold (the user can also select no background subtraction).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.2 Myelin sheath selection</title>
      <p>The Frangi vesselness (<xref rid="btz403-B1" ref-type="bibr">Frangi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>) plugin is used to select myelin sheaths. Non-myelin sheath pixels are removed using a combination of ‘grey scale attribute filtering’ from the <italic>MorphoLibJ</italic> library (<xref rid="btz403-B7" ref-type="bibr">Legland <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) and removal of a high intensity mask (that corresponds to cell bodies); both of which are optional. % myelination is calculated as:</p>
      <p>Total myelin pixels/Total neurite pixels * 100.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.3 Neurite selection</title>
      <p>The percentage of (%) neurite density is calculated using the ImageJ filter ‘normalize local contrast’ (NLC). Alternatively, all standard ImageJ thresholding methods are also available to the user.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.4 Neurite density analysis</title>
      <p>% neurite density is calculated as:</p>
      <p>Total neurite pixels/Total pixels * 100.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.5 Statistical analysis</title>
      <p>MyelinJ links ImageJ to R via the command line and uses the ggpubr package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/kassambara/ggpubr">https://github.com/kassambara/ggpubr</ext-link>) for statistical analysis and the production of publication ready graphs. MyelinJ performs Welch’s T test followed by correction for multiple testing using the false discovery rate (FDR). The user can choose between comparing all experimental conditions to each other or comparing all experimental conditions to control only.</p>
    </sec>
  </sec>
  <sec>
    <title>3 Results</title>
    <p>MyelinJ calculates ‘% myelination’ and ‘% neurite density’. In order to test the macro we first analysed an <italic>in vitro</italic> myelinating time course and compared it to the freely available CellProfiler pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="btz403-F1">Fig. 1A–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref> illustrates comparisons for the entire time course). MyelinJ is able to identify about 46% more myelin sheath pixels on average per image than Cellprofiler, based on a comparison of 30 images at each time point taken from three technical replicates. In previously published data based on this model this is the standard number of images to constitute a biological replicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="btz403-F1">Fig. 1E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1C</xref>). MyelinJ’s neurite density is also more consistent across images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="btz403-F1">Fig. 1J–M</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). MyelinJ was also compared to manual analysis of % myelination by drawing over the myelin sheaths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="btz403-F1">Fig. 1G–I</xref>). MyelinJ is very similar to manual analysis and takes ∼15–18 s per image compared to about 15 min per image. Furthermore, we find that Frangi vesselness is superior to the Otsu thresholding method in ImageJ for determining % myelination, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1E</xref>.

    </fig>
    <p>MyelinJ’s ability to ignore non-myelin sheath background was tested using myelinating cultures that have been demyelinated in a complement-mediated manner (<xref rid="btz403-B10" ref-type="bibr">McCanney <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Demyelination leaves significant background, which is predominantly not myelin sheaths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="btz403-F1">Fig. 1N</xref>). MyelinJ effectively disregards the non-myelin sheath background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="btz403-F1">Fig. 1M</xref>). Furthermore, MyelinJ successfully analyses the remaining undamaged myelin sheaths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="btz403-F1">Fig. 1M</xref>). In comparison, CellProfiler misses the majority of these myelin sheaths (for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="btz403-F1">Fig. 1N</xref> CellProfiler identified 0% myelination—image post analysis not shown). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref> illustrates the graphs and statistical analysis performed by MyelinJ for an example dataset (demyelination versus remyelination), using the ggpubr package in R.</p>

    <title>4 Conclusions</title>
    <p>This newly developed MyelinJ is a user friendly ImageJ macro for the analysis of fluorescent micrographs of 2D myelinating cultures providing quantification of the % of neurite density and the % of myelination. To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no other publicly available ImageJ macros for this analysis and MyelinJ marks a significant improvement upon the freely available CellProfiler pipeline (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/muecs/cp">https://github.com/muecs/cp</ext-link>), being able to more accurately analyse both myelin sheaths and neurites. MyelinJ also offers automated calculation of % neurite density and % myelination in order to avoid human error, can analyse complex experiments where a summary of the results for each condition is provided and seamlessly links to R for the graphical representation of results and statistical analysis. In addition, MyelinJ analyses myelin sheaths significantly better than the Otsu ImageJ thresholding algorithm (Otsu was selected following comparisons between all ImageJ thresholding algorithms). This is the first time (to the best of our knowledge) that an ImageJ macro that can interact with the statistical package R has been made freely available. MyelinJ uses the ggpubr package to perform statistical analysis and produce publication quality graphs, providing a seamless analysis pipeline from raw images to graphical representation and statistical analysis for high throughput screens.</p>
