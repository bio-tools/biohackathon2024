      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Antibody therapies have become an important class of therapeutics in recent years as they have exhibited outstanding efficacy and safety in the treatment of several major diseases including cancers, immune-related diseases, infectious disease and hematological disease. There has been significant progress in the global research and development landscape of antibody therapies in the past decade. In this review, we have collected available data from the Umabs Antibody Therapies Database (Umabs-DB, <ext-link xlink:href="https://umabs.com" ext-link-type="uri">https://umabs.com</ext-link>) as of 30 June 2022. The Umabs-DB shows that 162 antibody therapies have been approved by at least one regulatory agency in the world, including 122 approvals in the US, followed by 114 in Europe, 82 in Japan and 73 in China, whereas biosimilar, diagnostic and veterinary antibodies are not included in our statistics. Although the US and Europe have been at the leading position for decades, rapid advancement has been witnessed in Japan and China in the past decade. The approved antibody therapies include 115 canonical antibodies, 14 antibody-drug conjugates, 7 bispecific antibodies, 8 antibody fragments, 3 radiolabeled antibodies, 1 antibody-conjugate immunotoxin, 2 immunoconjugates and 12 Fc-Fusion proteins. They have been developed against 91 drug targets, of which PD-1 is the most popular, with 14 approved antibody-based blockades for cancer treatment in the world. This review outlined the global landscape of the approved antibody therapies with respect to the regulation agencies, therapeutic targets and indications, aiming to provide an insight into the trends of the global development of antibody therapies.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Antibody therapy is a form of targeted treatment that uses antibody-based molecules to treat human diseases [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are immunoglobulins produced by plasma B cells as stimulated by a specific antigen. Antibodies can perform several roles in the human immune system, such as facilitating humoral and cellular immune responses to a wide range of antigens with high specificity and long-term efficacy. Thus, it has emerged as a major class of therapeutics since the approval of the first mAb, anti-CD3 OKT3 (also known as muromonab-CD3), by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in 1986 [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The number of approved and marketed antibody therapies has reached 162 as of 30 June 2022, targeting a wide range of diseases including cancers, immune-related disease, infectious disease and hematological disease. The benefits of using antibody therapies stem from their high selectivity and optimal binding affinity. In addition, the safety and efficacy of antibody therapies are closely related to the characteristics of their therapeutic targets, such as expression patterns and the role they perform in the progression of disease [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Targets in cancers and immune-related diseases are well characterized, such as PD-1/PD-L1, CD20, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, HER2 and CD3. As a result, the approved antibody therapies are mostly developed for the treatment of these indications, although a broader range of diseases have also been investigated [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in COVID-19 infectious disease and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the central nervous system (CNS) disorders, have aroused broad interest in recent years [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
    <p>The global antibody therapies market was merely 0.3 billion USD in 1997 and rapidly increased to 186 billion USD in 2021. However, there are thousands of ongoing clinical trials and preclinical studies, and so the market is estimated to reach 445 billion USD by 2028, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.2% from 2022 to 2028 [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The market of antibody therapies has been growing fast and shows great market potential in the overall healthcare industry in the US, Europe, Japan and China. Companies with the largest number of approved antibodies and greatest share of the market are mostly located in the US due to their long-term investment into R&amp;D. The market position of the US is followed by Europe, whereas there has been a rapid growth in the number of companies and approved antibodies in China and Japan over the past 5 years [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
    <p>In this review, we collected data from the Umabs Antibody Therapies Database (Umabs-DB) [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], to make a statistical analysis of the antibodies approved by at least one drug regulatory agency of the world, excluding biosimilar, diagnostic and veterinary antibodies. We firstly inspected the number of antibody therapies approved by drug regulatory agencies for each year, which shows the trend of the approval of antibody therapies in different regions. Then, the format of antibody therapies on the year of their first approval is presented, showing the historical map to the development of new antibody formats. Targets and indications of antibody therapies in each historical period are presented to show the progress of global R&amp;D. Lastly, approvals from companies in different countries and regions are analyzed to predict the future trend in the development of antibody therapies.</p>

    <title>GLOBAL LANDSCAPE OF ANTIBODY THERAPIES APPROVAL</title>
    <p>As of 30 June 2022, we reviewed a total of 162 antibody therapies approved by at least one drug regulatory agency in the world, including nine that were later withdrawn. Biosimilar, diagnostic and veterinary antibodies were not included for the analysis. An overview on the number of antibody therapies approved in each year and in different regions is presented in <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>

    <p>Counting the number of global approvals, around 93% of approved antibody therapies were first approved by only four major drug regulatory agencies, which are the FDA in the US, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in Europe, the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in Japan, and the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). The remaining 7% of antibody therapies were first approved in Canada, Brazil, Cuba, India and Russia. Historically, the FDA, EMA, NMPA, and PMDA started to give antibody therapies market approval in the 1990s. For the 162 approved antibody therapies to date, the FDA has approved 122, the EMA has approved 114 (including 4 approved by European countries prior to the formal establishment of the EMA), the NMPA has approved 73, and the PMDA has approved 82. In this review, we mainly focus on the approvals by these four drug regulatory agencies. If one antibody was first approved by one of the other agencies, the first approval information was given but the approvals in other countries were not specifically listed.</p>
    <p>Our data show that the US has had the greatest number of approvals, and is far ahead of other countries and regions. After the first antibody therapy (OKT3) was approved by the FDA in 1986, it took another 8 years to approve the second antibody therapy in 1994. This was Abciximab, a treatment of cardiovascular disease which acts by binding to the αIIbβ3 integrin to prevent clotting [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Since 2000, there has been at least one antibody therapy approved by the FDA every year. This has led the US to dominate the number of antibody therapy approvals for more than two decades.</p>
    <p>The first antibody therapy approved in Europe was Nebacumab in 1991, which was an anti-endotoxin antibody for the treatment of sepsis [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although Nebacumab was withdrawn in 1993 because it failed to reduce mortality in the following clinical performance, it was the only approved human IgM antibody to date [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The second antibody therapy approved in Europe in 1995 was Edrecolomab, a murine antibody targeting EpCAM for the treatment of colorectal cancer [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Between 1995 and 2014, the EMA only approved less than five antibodies annually, but since 2015, the number of annual approvals has increased to around 10.</p>
    <p>Japan and China are about 10 years behind the US and Europe in terms of the number of approvals and clinical trials. However, Japan and China have witnessed rapid development in antibody therapies over the past decade. The first antibody approved in Japan was the anti-CD52 Alemtuzumab in 2001 [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which was a humanized antibody developed by Sanofi Genzyme for the treatment of leukemia. The first locally developed antibody approved in Japan was Tocilizumab in 2005, which was a humanized antibody targeting the interleukin 6 receptor (IL-6R) for the treatment of arthritis [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Since then, the number of approvals in Japan has steadily increased, especially after 2014. As for China, the first antibody therapy was approved by the NMPA in 1999. This was a murine anti-CD3 antibody IOR-T3 developed by a Cuban company, for the treatment of organ transplant rejection [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In 2002, a locally developed antibody called Wut3, which was also a murine anti-CD3 antibody for the treatment of transplant rejection, was approved in China. Until 2017, the number of antibody therapies approved in China was &lt;5 for each year. But since 2018, the annual approvals have increased to &gt; 10, and even reached 18 in 2021. Although a total of 73 antibody therapies were approved by the NMPA in China for a wide range of indications, only 18 antibodies were developed by local companies. However, very recently, there was a first-in-class anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 bispecific antibody, Cadonilimab, approved by the NMPA for the treatment of metastatic cervical cancer [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Cadonilimab, the first bispecific antibody with dual immune checkpoint inhibition approved in the world, could signal a future increase in innovative antibody therapy development in China.</p>

    <title>ANTIBODY DISCOVERY AND ENGINEERING IN APPROVED ANTIBODIES</title>
    <p>In 1975, Georges Köhler and César Milstein established the hybridoma platform based on the fusion of murine B cell and myeloma cells, which enables the <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> production of a large amount of pure mAbs [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Subsequently, chimeric antibodies formed by domain recombination, and then humanized antibodies, obtained primarily by complementary-determining region (CDR) grafting, have been enabled for mAb production [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, fully human antibodies have been developed from phage display [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], yeast display [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], mammalian cell display [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], transgenic animals [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and human blood samples [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It is noted that the phage display developed antibodies are not naturally occurring human antibodies as their heavy chain and light chain sequences were not from the same B cells. More recently, glycoengineering has become a powerful tool to optimize the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of an antibody [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. For example, Fc core fucosylation has been shown to enhance FcγRIIIa binding and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity of antibodies [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Meanwhile, an antibody lacking core fucosylation (afucosylated) increased ADCC activity through highly increased IgG-Fc receptor IIIa (FcγRIIIa) affinity [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. There are currently four approved afucosylated antibodies: Obinutuzumab, Mogamulizumab Benralizumab and Inebilizumab.</p>
    <p>The total number of rodent antibody therapies is only 11, out of which four have been withdrawn. In 1986, the first antibody therapy based on this technique, OKT3, was a murine mAb against CD3 expressed on the T cell surface, acting as an immunosuppressor in organ transplant rejection [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. No more murine antibody therapies have been approved since Rabimabs, which was approved in India for the treatment of rabies in 2019 [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. For those approved non-humanized antibodies, anti-CD3/EpCAM Catumaxomab is a mouse-rat hybrid bispecific antibody, first approved by the EMA for the treatment of gastric cancer in 2009. This was also the first bispecific antibody to gain regulatory approval despite being withdrawn due to commercial failure [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Moxetumomab pasudotox is the only murine antibody-conjugate immunotoxin and was approved by the FDA in 2018 for the treatment of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>
    <p>There are risks and disadvantages of murine mAbs or mAbs from other animals for human administration. For example, patients would produce a rapid immune response through generation of human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) against the murine antibodies, which greatly shortens the serum half-life of the therapy [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In addition, the ability of the murine Fc region to elicit ADCC in patients is limited [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. To overcome these problems of murine mAbs, several engineering techniques have been developed to make their sequence more similar to the human antibody while maintaining binding affinity and specificity. The first technique developed was to create a chimeric antibody, which recombined the murine variable domains with a human constant region (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. There are a total of 16 approved chimeric antibody therapies which are in multiple formats, including naked whole IgGs, fragments, and antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). The first murine antibody therapy, Abciximab [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], was first approved in Cuba. A chimeric fragment antibody radiolabeled with Iodine 131, denoted as Iodine 131 Metuximab, was also approved by the NMPA in 2006 for the treatment of liver cancer [<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In addition, in 2021, there was a chimeric ADC, loncastuximab tesirine, approved by the FDA for the treatment of large B-cell lymphoma. This indicates that the chimeric antibody is still popular for some applications [<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p>

    <p>Later, researchers set out to humanize an antibody mainly by grafting the CDR regions from mice into a human framework sequence [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. After humanization, antibody therapies show much less immunogenicity but are often associated with loss of affinity. Therefore, a variety of methods have been innovated to restore and increase antibody affinity and specificity [<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. As an important method of antibody engineering, 66 humanized antibodies from a diverse range of animals with multiple formats have been approved. The first humanized antibody therapy, anti-CD25 Daclizumab, was approved by the FDA in 1997 for the treatment of transplant rejection [<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Since then, humanized antibody therapies accounted for a high proportion of the approved antibody therapies each year (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>
    <p>In 1990, Gregory P. Winter introduced phage display of antibody fragments, in which exogenous human antibody genetic sequences can be incorporated into the filamentous bacteriophage genome and expressed on the phage surface for further specificity and affinity screening [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Transgenic animals provided another powerful technique for the development of fully human antibodies, and was developed in 1994 by creating two transgenic mouse models that were genetically engineered to have human immunoglobulin genes, thus allowing the mice to express fully human antibodies after immunization [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In addition, the single B cell technique was developed to directly isolate antigen-specific B cells from human blood for the generation of human natural antibodies [<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47–49</xref>]. A total of 55 fully human antibody therapies have been approved so far. The first fully human antibody therapy, the IgM antibody Nebacumab, was approved in 1991 [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The first human whole IgG antibody therapy Adalimumab was approved by the FDA in 2002, which was developed by phage display to target against TNF-alpha for the treatment of rheumatic diseases [<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The technique to isolate antigen-specific B cells directly from human blood has been successfully applied to discover antiviral antibodies [<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] such as REGN-EB3 targeting Ebola viral surface glycoprotein approved by the FDA in 2020 [<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and Evusheld targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and first approved by the EMA in 2022 [<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p>
    <p>In addition, the recent advances in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) make it a useful tool in rapid antibody discovery [<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55–57</xref>]. With the ever-progressing antibody discovery technologies, we believe there will likely be another wave of clinical trials and approvals for antibody therapies discovered from such innovative platforms.</p>
    <p>Engineering of antibodies has evolved through a few stages whereby at first naked whole animal IgG antibodies were used directly as therapeutics, followed by recombination, humanization and affinity maturation. However, today we see more engineered antibody formats in a variety of shapes and sizes (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). We have categorized all approved antibody therapies into five classes: canonical antibody, fragment of antibody, ADC, bispecific antibody and other formats (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Canonical antibodies have the whole antibody structure, consisting of two full-length heavy chains and two light chains. Of all approved antibodies, there are 115 canonical antibodies, 114 of which are IgGs and the other one is IgM (Nebacumab) [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Antibody fragments are composed of a few domains of the whole antibody structure but can act as therapies themselves. This format includes Fab fragments, single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), Fc fragments, and the variable regions of the camelid heavy chain of heavy-chain-only antibodies (VHH), which was fused with a human Fc fragment or with another VHH. There has been a total of eight fragment antibody therapies approved so far. The only scFv is the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A Brolucizumab for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration, approved by the FDA in 2019 [<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Four Fab fragments have been approved so far, of which the first approved Fab fragment antibody therapy was Abciximab [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. There has also been one PEGylated Fab fragment, Certolizumab Pegol, approved in 2008 for the treatment of autoimmune-related diseases [<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. ScFv is a small-sized antibody, which fuses only the variable regions of the heavy and light chain of the whole antibody, making it easier to penetrate the tissues [<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61–63</xref>]. The only Fc fragment antibody therapy, Efgartigimod alfa, was first approved by the FDA in 2021, targeting neonatal Fc Receptor (FcRn) for the treatment of myasthenia gravis [<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. There are two antibody therapies composed of VHH, Caplacizumab and Envafolimab, which were first approved by the EMA in 2018 and the NMPA in 2021, respectively. Caplacizumab is a bivalent single domain antibody with VHH–VHH format, whereas Envafolimab is a VHH-Fc fusion.</p>
    <p>ADCs are composed of a monoclonal antibody chemically linked to a small molecule drug as a payload. There have been 14 ADCs approved so far. Meanwhile, bispecifics are engineered antibodies or antibody fragments designed to combine two or more different antigen-binding domains in an integrated structure. There have been seven bispecific antibodies approved to date. The structures of bispecific antibodies include the heterodimeric bispecific antibody (Catumaxomab, Emicizumab, Amivantamab, Faricimab, Mosunetuzumab), scFv-based bispecific antibody such as bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) (Blinatumomab), and IgG-scFv-based tetravalent (Cadonilimab). As for other special formats of antibody therapies, we have classified them into the “others” group, which includes antibody-conjugate immunotoxin (with a bacterial toxin, moxetumomab pasudotox), radiolabeled antibodies (Iodine 131 derlotuximab biotin, Iodine 131 Tositumomab), radiolabeled Fab fragments (Iodine 131 Metuximab), Fc-fusion proteins, an scFv fused with a TCR (Tebentafusp), and an antibody fused with an enzyme (Pabinafusp alfa).</p>

    <title>LANDSCAPES OF TARGETS AND INDICATIONS OF APPROVED ANTIBODY THERAPIES</title>
    <sec id="sec7">
      <title> </title>
      <p>There are several effects when an antibody binds to its targets, including blocking of a ligand, blocking receptor dimerization, mediating receptor internalization, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, ADCC, and complement-dependent cytotoxicity [<xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p>
      <p>Validation of a therapeutic target takes considerable research input, rendering the number of targets for clinical development very limited. There are 91 targets involved in the 162 approved antibody therapies. Some targets have been extensively studied, such as PD-1, CD3, CD20, EGFR,VEGF, and HER2, such that a large proportion of approved antibody therapies have been based on these targets, which are all cancer and immune-related disease targets [<xref rid="ref66" ref-type="bibr">66–70</xref>]. It is notable that CD3 is used as a target for T cell-dependent bispecific antibodies, rather than as a direct tumor target for cancer treatment. Furthermore, other targets emerged recently such as the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for SARS-CoV-2 infections since the Covid-19 pandemic (antibody therapy Regdanvimab, Amubarvimab + Romlusevimab cocktail, Sotrovimab, and Evusheld) and the CGRP for CNS diseases (antibody Fremanezumab, Galcanezumab, and Eptinezumab) (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p>

      <p>For approved antibody therapies, 112 have been developed against 30 targets, and the remaining 61 targets are associated with the 63 antibody therapies. Of those antibody therapies against the 30 targets, seven are bispecific antibodies, one is a combination therapy (Relatlimab + Nivolumab), two are canonical antibodies (Ustekinumab and Bimekizumab), two are Fc-Fusion proteins (Abatacept and Belatacept) and one is an immunoconjugate (Tebentafusp) developed against two targets (thus counted twice), resulting in significant research and market competition on these popular targets. The most popular 20 targets are mainly applied to the treatment of cancers (PD-1/PD-L1, CD20 [<xref rid="ref71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, <xref rid="ref72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], VEGF [<xref rid="ref69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], EGFR [<xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, <xref rid="ref73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], HER2 [<xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], CD3 [<xref rid="ref74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], CD19 [<xref rid="ref75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], CD22 [<xref rid="ref76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], GD2 [<xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]), immune-related diseases (TNF-alpha [<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], IL-6R [<xref rid="ref78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], IL-23 [<xref rid="ref79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], IL-17A [<xref rid="ref80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], IL-1 [<xref rid="ref81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]), infectious diseases (SARS-CoV-2 spike protein [<xref rid="ref82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], Rabies virus GP [<xref rid="ref83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]), CNS diseases (CGRP [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]), and hematological disease (C5 [<xref rid="ref84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], Factor IX [<xref rid="ref85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]). Approval agencies of these antibodies and their targets are also presented showing different healthcare demands in these countries or regions (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>
      <p>Choices of therapeutic targets have progressed over time. Among the top 20 targets, there are some “new” targets (PD-1/PD-L1, CD19, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, CGPR, Rabies virus GP, and IL-6R) with antibodies approved only after 2011. In contrast, the target TNF-alpha has no antibodies approved after 2010, showing that it has been thoroughly developed and left no market space. In 2018, the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine was awarded to the discovery of the immune checkpoint PD-1, which acts as a “brake” for activated T cells in the tumor microenvironment and is considered to be a key target for the treatment of many cancers [<xref rid="ref86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. With the global pandemics of COVID-19, there came an emerging focus on the discovery of neutralizing antibodies for the prevention or treatment of respiratory syndromes from COVID-19, for which a total of four antibody therapies have been approved so far.</p>
      <p>With respect to the indications of the approved antibodies, we have categorized seven classes based on their pathology. It can be easily interpreted that nearly half (42.6%) of the antibody therapies are for cancers, 37% for immune-related diseases, 11% for infectious diseases, and 7.4% for hematological diseases, whereas antibodies for other indications only account for &lt; 3% (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Likewise, interests on indications have changed over time. Cancers have always been the largest indication for antibody therapies, enabled by the extensive characterization of several key therapeutic targets, as discussed before. The first antibody therapy for the treatment of cancer, Rituximab, was a chimeric IgG1 mAb targeting CD20 and was approved for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 1997 by the FDA [<xref rid="ref87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>, <xref rid="ref88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Rituximab worked well in the clinic as a chimeric antibody, as it caused prompt and nearly complete depletion of peripheral B cells, which alleviated the immunogenic concern introduced by the administration of a chimeric antibody. Antibody therapies have revolutionized the treatment of immune-related diseases due to their efficacy, specificity, speed of onset, and tolerability. It should be noted that CNS diseases have been an emerging therapeutic area for antibody therapies since 2016, in which antibodies could lead to some breakthrough treatments (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>

      <title>COMPANIES/ORGANIZATIONS</title>
      <p>Scrutinizing the companies with at least one approved antibody, there are a total of 82 companies. The number of companies that have had their antibody therapies first approved by the FDA is 33. For the EMA, it is 15 companies, for the NMPA it is 17, for the PDMA it is 7, and for other agencies it is 10 (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The number of companies suggests that the US is in a leading position in antibody therapy as it also dominates the research and clinical development in the field. For the companies in the FDA group, most approvals occurred between 2016 and 2020, which is similar to the first approvals by the EMA, PMDA, and agencies in the other group. However, the year 2021 saw a peak (8 companies) in the number of companies that had first approvals by the NMPA (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). This suggests an enormous scale of research funding and capital was put into the field over the past decade in China.</p>

GSK, BMS, Amgen, and Eli Lilly show a stronger historical interest in cancer antibody therapies as they possess 5, 4, 3, and 3 approvals, respectively. In comparison, they possess 2, 2, 2, and 1 approvals in immune-related diseases, which are their second largest therapeutic field. Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca and Novartis show higher achievement in immune-related disease antibody therapies, as they possess 6, 3 and 3 approvals, which outnumber their approvals in cancer. Roche, Sanofi and Regeneron show a balanced output in antibody therapy for cancer (8, 2, and 2 approvals) and immune-related disease (8, 2 and 2 approvals). Hematological disorder has been more explored by AstraZeneca and Sanofi (2 and 2 approvals). Similarly, antibody therapy of infectious disease is characteristic to GSK and AstraZeneca (2 and 2 approvals), whereas therapy of eye-related diseases has only successfully been developed by Roche and Novartis (2 and 1 approvals).</p>

    <title>CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVE</title>
    <p>Antibody therapies have become the leading treatment for a range of human diseases. More than 160 antibody therapies have been approved in the world, but this is just a start. The emerging discovery technologies play an important role in speeding up R&amp;D that will make more antibody candidates available for clinical development. Several antibody discovery technologies are widely applicable today, including hybridoma, <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> display (phage display, yeast display and mammalian cell display, etc.) and single B cell technology. During the COVID-19 pandemic, several neutralizing antibodies that were discovered by characterizing single B cells in patients’ blood have been approved. Bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) was the first antibody receiving FDA emergency use authorization to treat COVID-19 infection [<xref rid="ref89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. It only took a few months to complete the early discovery of neutralizing antibodies by the combination of single B cells characterization, NGS, and a machine learning algorithm. Furthermore, NGS, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence are advancing antibody discovery to find and generate new antibody molecules that have better pharmacological properties. We believe further advancements in the fields of NGS, bioinformatics, and data-driven technology will continue to accelerate antibody discovery. Antibody discovery advancement and the discovery of new antibody targets will also combine to benefit the development of new antibody therapies.</p>
    <p>The past decade has witnessed that the immunotherapeutic PD-1/PD-L1 blockade revolutionized the treatment of many types of cancer. The success of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies catalyzed the development of cancer immunotherapy. So far, the global regulatory authority has approved 12 antibodies targeting PD-1 (Pembrolizumab, Nivolumab, Sintilimab, Cemiplimab, Toripalimab, Tislelizumab, Camrelizumab, Prolgolimab, Penpulimab, Dostarlimab, Zimberelimab, and Serplulimab) and five antibodies targeting PD-L1 (Atezolizumab, Durvalumab, Avelumab, Sugemalimab, and Envafolimab). In addition, a bispecific antibody targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1 (Cadonilimab) and a two-antibody cocktail targeting LAG-3 and PD-1 (Relatlimab + Nivolumab) were approved this year. However, among the immune checkpoint antibodies, only anti-CTLA-4 and anti-LAG-3 antibodies have shown promising efficacy in combination with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies; it may help overcome the limitations seen in prior treatments. Apart from PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies, the limited efficacy of the immune checkpoint antibodies encouraged the discovery of novel targets for cancer immunotherapy.</p>
    <p>Over the past four decades, there has been a significant change in the spectrum of antibody modalities. Traditional modalities of antibody therapies are protein-based molecules including canonical antibodies, ADCs, bispecific antibodies, and antibody fragments. Recently, the Chinese Antibody Society (CAS) introduced a new concept of AntibodyPlus™ for future antibody therapies. The AntibodyPlus™ therapies contain an antibody component and/or other modalities in medicine such as cell and mRNA expressing antibody therapies. There is no doubt that CAR-T cell therapy is getting more attention in such AntibodyPlus™ therapies. The FDA has already approved five CAR-T cell therapies (Abecma [<xref rid="ref90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], Breyanzi [<xref rid="ref91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], Kymriah [<xref rid="ref92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], Tecartus [<xref rid="ref93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], and Yescarta [<xref rid="ref94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]) to treat hematological malignancies. With the novel strategies introduced to enhance the efficacy of CAR-T cell therapies, we will see a breakthrough for the treatment of solid tumors soon. In addition, one more interesting modality of antibody therapies is mRNA-encoded antibodies. The mRNA-encoded antibody circumvents the problems of complex production and purification processes, aberrant post-translational modifications inherent in protein-based antibodies. In addition, a mixture of mRNA sequences can simplify the manufacturing of antibody cocktails [<xref rid="ref95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>, <xref rid="ref96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. The potential of mRNA-based antibody therapies is one of the most attractive aspects of next-generation antibody therapies.</p>
    <p>In spite of these advancements, antibody therapies are still one of the fastest growing therapeutic forms in the world. This is achieved by consistent investment in R&amp;D and the maturation of emerging markets. The global antibody therapy industry and its market will be substantially larger in the future.</p>
