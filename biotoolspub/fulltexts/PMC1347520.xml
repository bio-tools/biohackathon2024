    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the National Institutes of Health was created in 1988 to develop information systems for molecular biology. In addition to maintaining the GenBank(R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>) nucleic acid sequence database, to which data are submitted by the scientific community, NCBI provides data retrieval systems and computational resources for the analysis of GenBank data and a variety of other biological data. For the purposes of this article, the NCBI suite of database resources are grouped into six broad categories. All resources discussed are available from the NCBI home page at: (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/>). In most cases, the data underlying these resources are available for bulk download at (<ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp.ncbi.nih.gov"/>), a link from the NCBI home page.</p>

      <title>Entrez</title>
      <p>Entrez (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>) is an integrated database retrieval system that enables text searching, using simple Boolean queries, of a diverse set of 30 databases, six added during the past year. Global Query, the default search on the NCBI homepage, searches across all the Entrez databases and rapidly returns the counts of matching records in each database. A user may then display results or further refine searches in any individual database. The Entrez databases include almost 70 million DNA and protein sequences derived from several sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>), the NCBI taxonomy, genomes, population sets, gene expression data, ∼800 000 gene-oriented sequence clusters in UniGene, almost half a million sequence-tagged sites in UniSTS, 20 million genetic variations in dbSNP, ∼30 000 protein structures from the Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>), 138 000 3D and 11 000 alignment-based protein domains and the biomedical literature via PubMed, PubmedCentral, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), and online Books. PubMed includes ∼15 million citations from ∼4700 life science journals for biomedical articles back to the 1950s, most with abstracts and many with links to the full-text article. The Books database contains more than 49 online scientific textbooks including the NCBI Handbook, a comprehensive guide to NCBI resources. To enable researchers to quickly reach the appropriate NCBI resource, the content of the NCBI web pages and FTP directories has been incorporated into an Entrez database of its own. Searches of the NCBI web site using the same powerful queries available for the biological databases are therefore possible.</p>
      <p>Entrez provides extensive links within and between database records. In their simplest form, these links may be simple cross-references between a sequence and the abstract of the paper in which it is reported, or between a protein sequence and its coding DNA sequence or, perhaps, its 3D structure. Other examples are links between a genomic assembly and its components or between a genomic sequence and those sequences derived from its annotation. Computationally derived links between ‘neighboring records’, such as those based on computed similarities among sequences or among PubMed abstracts, allow rapid access to groups of related records. A service called LinkOut expands the range of links to include external services, such as organism-specific genome databases. To accommodate the growing number of links, Entrez provides a Links pull down menu that appears in the top, right hand corner of record displays.</p>
      <p>The records retrieved in Entrez can be displayed in many formats and downloaded singly or in batches. A redirection control allows results to be saved in a local file, shown in the browser as plain text, or sent to the Entrez clipboard. PubMed results may be emailed directly from Entrez. Formats available for GenBank records include the GenBank Flatfile, FASTA, XML, ASN.1 and others. Graphical display formats are offered for some types of records, including genomic records. For sequence records, a formatting control allows the display or download of a particular range of residues.</p>
      <p>Entrez has introduced ‘MyNCBI’ which allows users to store personal configuration options, such as search filters, LinkOut preferences and document delivery providers. MyNCBI also saves searches and can automatically e-mail updated search results. Also new in Entrez is a set of up to five default filter tabs used to display subsets of database results. The tabs vary according to Entrez database; examples of some defaults include, ‘mRNA’ and ‘RefSesq’ subsets for Nucleotide, a ‘Review’ subset for PubMed, ‘NMR’ and ‘X-ray’ subsets for Structure. Default filter tabs can be changed using MyNCBI. Additional MyNCBI features include changing the way Entrez links are displayed to standard html links or pull downs, and highlighting PubMed search terms.</p>
      <p>Access to Entrez via user-scripting is facilitated using the Entrez Programming Utilities (E-Utilities), a suite of eight server-side programs supporting a uniform set of parameters used to search, link between and download from, the Entrez databases. A search history, available via interactive Entrez as well as via the E-Utilities, allows users to recall the results of previous searches during an Entrez session and combine them using Boolean logic. The ‘einfo’ utility can be used to retrieve detailed information about the Entrez databases, such as lists of supported search fields or the date of the last database update, while ‘egquery’ returns the number of matches to a single query in every Entrez database. An automated system may use E-Utilities, such as ‘efetch’ or ‘esummary’, to retrieve the data. Recently, support for new download formats was added to the E-Utilities, for several of the Entrez databases, such as Gene, SNP and Taxonomy while a new E-Utility, ‘espell’, was implemented to check spelling within Entrez queries and to offer suggestions in cases where a misspelling might cause key records to be missed. A Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) interface to the E-Utilities supports structured, XML-based access. Instructions for using the E-Utilities are found under the ‘Entrez Tools’ link on the NCBI home page.</p>

      <title>PubMed Central</title>
      <p>PubMed Central (PMC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) is a digital archive of peer reviewed journals in the life sciences providing access to ∼400 000 full-text articles, an increase of ∼100 000 from the past year. More than 200 journals, including Nucleic Acids Research, deposit the full text of their articles in PMC. Participation in PMC requires a commitment to free access to full text, either immediately after publication or within a 12-month period. All PMC free articles are identified in PubMed search results and PMC itself can be searched using Entrez.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Taxonomy</title>
      <p>The NCBI taxonomy database, growing at the rate of 3000 new taxa a month, indexes ∼205 000 named organisms that are represented in the databases with at least 1 nt or protein sequence. The Taxonomy Browser can be used to view the taxonomic position or retrieve data from any of the principal Entrez databases for a particular organism or group. The Taxonomy Browser also displays links to the Map Viewer, Genomic BLAST services, the Trace Archive, and to external model organism and taxonomic databases via LinkOut. Searches of the NCBI taxonomy may be made on the basis of whole, partial or phonetically spelled organism names. Entrez Taxonomy displays include custom taxonomic trees representing user-defined subsets of the full NCBI taxonomy.</p>

    <title>THE BLAST FAMILY OF SEQUENCE-SIMILARITY SEARCH PROGRAMS</title>
    <p>The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) perform sequence-similarity searches against a variety of sequence databases, returning a set of gapped alignments with links to full database records, to UniGene, Gene, the MMDB or GEO. One variant, BLAST2Sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), compares two DNA or protein sequences and produces a dot-plot representation of the alignments.</p>
    <p>Each alignment returned by BLAST is scored and assigned a measure of statistical significance, called the Expectation Value (<italic>E</italic>-value). BLAST takes into account the amino acid composition of the query sequence in its estimation of statistical significance. This composition-based statistical treatment, used in conventional protein BLAST searches as well as PSI-BLAST searches, tends to reduce the number of false-positive database hits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). The alignments returned can be limited by an <italic>E</italic>-value threshold or range.</p>
    <p>Standard output formats include the default pairwise alignment, several query-anchored multiple sequence alignment formats, an easily-parsable Hit Table and a taxonomically organized output. Database sequences appearing in BLAST results may be marked for batch retrieval using check boxes. A new, enhanced, formatter displays alignments against database sequences that are &gt;200 000 bp in length with links to nearby features, such as genes. A new ‘Pairwise with identities’ mode better highlights differences between the query and a target sequence. An option to display masked characters in lower-case or using distinct colors is now available.</p>
    <p>The web BLAST interface allows both the initial search and the results displayed to be restricted to a database subset using an Entrez query as a filter. Web BLAST uses a standard URL-API that allows complete search specifications, including BLAST parameters, such as Entrez restrictions and the search query, to be contained in a URL posted to the web page.</p>
    <p>MegaBLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), designed to find nearly exact matches, offers a Web interface that handles batch nucleotide queries and operates up to 10 times faster than standard nucleotide BLAST. MegaBLAST is the default search program for NCBIs Genomic BLAST pages. MegaBLAST is also used to search the rapidly growing Trace Archive and is available for the standard BLAST databases as well. For rapid cross-species nucleotide queries, NCBI offers Discontiguous MegaBLAST which uses a non-contiguous word match (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) as the nucleus for its alignments. Discontiguous MegaBLAST is far more rapid than a translated search such as blastx, yet maintains a competitive degree of sensitivity when comparing coding regions.</p>
    <p>A new strategy has been designed to improve the speed of BLAST searches. The system, called ‘SplitD’, splits the databases into a number of segments to spread the calculations across multiple back-end machines. SplitD keeps track of the database segments that have been used most recently and are, therefore, most likely to remain in memory. These segments can be reused in the next search to avoid a slow read from disk storage.</p>
    <sec>
      <title>BLink</title>
      <p>BLAST Link (BLink) displays pre-computed BLAST alignments to similar sequences for each protein sequence in the Entrez databases. BLink can display alignment subsets limited by taxonomic criteria, by database of origin, relation to a complete genome, membership in a COG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) or by relation to a 3D structure or conserved protein domain. BLink links are displayed for protein records in Entrez as well as within Entrez Gene reports.</p>

      <title>Entrez Gene</title>
      <p>Entrez Gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), the successor to LocusLink, provides an interface to curated sequences and descriptive information about genes with links to NCBI's Map Viewer, Evidence Viewer, Model Maker, BLink, protein domains from NCBI's Conserved Domain Database and other gene-related resources. Data are accumulated and maintained through several international collaborations in addition to curation by in-house staff. Links within Gene to the newest citations in PubMed are maintained by curators and provided as Gene References into Function (GeneRIF). The GeneRIF link within Gene reports leads to a form allowing researchers to add GeneRIFs to a Gene report. Entrez Gene displays have recently been enhanced with a collapsible navigation panel containing a table of contents for the record, the set of links to other resources, and links to related NCBI tools. The complete Entrez Gene dataset, as well as organism-specific subsets, is available in the compact NCBI ASN.1 format on the NCBI FTP site. A new tool that converts the native Gene ASN.1 format into XML, called ‘gene2xml’, is available for several popular computer platforms at <ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/toolbox/ncbi_tools/converters/by_program/gene2xml/"/>. The tool supports filtering by organism so that organism-specific XML files can easily be generated from the comprehensive ASN.1 FTP file.</p>

      <title>UniGene</title>
      <p>UniGene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) is a system for partitioning GenBank sequences, including expressed sequence tags (ESTs), into a non-redundant set of gene-oriented clusters. Each UniGene cluster contains sequences that represent a unique gene and is linked to the tissue types in which the gene is expressed, model organism protein similarities and Entrez Gene. UniGene clusters are created for all organisms for which there are 70 000 or more ESTs in GenBank and includes ESTs for more than 30 animals and over 26 plants and fungi. For the human UniGene July 2005 release (build 186), ∼5.1 million human ESTs in GenBank were reduced almost a 100-fold in number to ∼53 000 sequence clusters. When sufficient genomic sequence is available, UniGene clusters are now built using a genome-based clustering system to identify sets of transcript sequences which correspond to distinct transcription loci or to annotated genes. The procedure used for genome-based clustering of transcript sequences is described at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/g_build.html"/>. The UniGene collection has been used as a source of unique sequences for the fabrication of microarrays for the large-scale study of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). UniGene databases are updated weekly with new EST sequences, and bimonthly with newly characterized sequences.</p>

      <title>Entrez Genome</title>
      <p>Entrez Genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) provides access to over 250 complete microbial genomic sequences (70 added over the past year), more than 2100 viral genomic sequences (500 added) and over 800 reference sequences for eukaryotic organelles (250 added). Over 20 higher eukaryotic genomes are also included, such as the recent arrival, <italic>Strovgylocentrotus purpuratus</italic>, the sea urchin. The Plant Genomes Central web page serves as a portal to completed plant genomes, to information on plant genome sequencing projects or to plant-related resources at NCBI, such as plant Genomic BLAST pages or Map Viewer. Specialized viewers and BLAST pages are also available for eukaryotic organelles and viruses. Genomes are chosen from an alphabetical listing or a phylogenetic tree and can be examined at increasing levels of detail ranging from a graphical overview of an entire genome to the level of a single gene. At the level of a genome or a chromosome, a Coding Regions display gives the locations coding regions, and the lengths, names and GenBank identification numbers of the protein products. An RNA Genes view lists the location and names for ribosomal and transfer RNA genes. A summary of COG functional groups is also presented. At the level of a single gene, links are provided to sequence neighbors for the implied protein with links to the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) database.</p>
      <p>For complete microbial genomes, pre-computed BLAST neighbors for protein sequences, including their taxonomic distribution and links to 3D structures, are given in TaxTables and PDBTables, respectively. Pairwise sequence alignments are linked to the Cn3D macromolecular structure viewer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) to generate displays of 3D structures coupled to sequence alignments. A TaxPlot tool plots similarities in the proteomes of two organisms to that of a reference organism for both more than 320 prokaryotic and almost 50 eukaryotic genomes. A related tool, GenePlot, generates plots of protein similarity for a pair of complete microbial genomes for the visualization of deleted, transposed or inverted genomic segments.</p>
      <p>A new ‘gMap’ tool combines the results of pre-computed whole microbial genome comparisons with on-the-fly BLAST comparisons clustering genomes with similar nucleotide sequences and then represents the pre-computed segments of similarity graphically. A novel sequence may be introduced into the display of pre-computed alignments using an on-the-fly BLAST comparison. Using gMap, one can quickly navigate from a high-level overview of the similarity between a set of genomes, to a nucleotide-level view of individual segments of alignment.</p>
