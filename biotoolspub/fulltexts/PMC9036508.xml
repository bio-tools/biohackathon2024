        <title>Background</title>
        <p id="Par1">The widely spreading coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has three major spreading properties: pathogenic mutations, spatial, and temporal propagation patterns. We know the spread of the virus geographically and temporally in terms of statistics, i.e., the number of patients. However, we are yet to understand the spread at the level of individual patients. As of March 2021, COVID-19 is wide-spread all over the world with new genetic variants. One important question is to track the early spreading patterns of COVID-19 until the virus has got spread all over the world.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Results</title>
        <p id="Par2">In this work, we proposed AutoCoV, a deep learning method with multiple loss object, that can track the early spread of COVID-19 in terms of spatial and temporal patterns until the disease is fully spread over the world in July 2020. Performances in learning spatial or temporal patterns were measured with two clustering measures and one classification measure. For annotated SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), AutoCoV outperformed seven baseline methods in our experiments for learning either spatial or temporal patterns. For spatial patterns, AutoCoV had at least 1.7-fold higher clustering performances and an F1 score of 88.1%. For temporal patterns, AutoCoV had at least 1.6-fold higher clustering performances and an F1 score of 76.1%. Furthermore, AutoCoV demonstrated the robustness of the embedding space with an independent dataset, Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID).</p>

      <sec>
        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p id="Par3">In summary, AutoCoV learns geographic and temporal spreading patterns successfully in experiments on NCBI and GISAID datasets and is the first of its kind that learns virus spreading patterns from the genome sequences, to the best of our knowledge. We expect that this type of embedding method will be helpful in characterizing fast-evolving pandemics.</p>

    <title>Background</title>
    <p id="Par22">In December 2019, a new virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) broke out as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and in March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Various vaccines are being developed as a result of the efforts of numerous scientists to overcome COVID-19, but the effectiveness of vaccines against the newly occurring mutations is not well established yet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As of August 2020, more than 21 million people were infected with SARS-CoV-2 across the world. In the United States, with the largest number of infections, 5.23 million or 1.7% of the U.S. population were infected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As the virus has spread, the number of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes increased and the sequence has been analyzed mainly for point mutations. Mutation-based studies classified the class of SARS-CoV-2 according to the type of variants and reported that COVID-19 in early Asia and Europe were caused by different types of viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition, the basic reproductive number (<inline-formula id="IEq2"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

As of March 2021, COVID-19 is wide-spread all over the world with new genetic variants. Once the virus becomes globally widespread, it is very difficult to track the spreading patterns of COVID-19 because of external factors such as the global lockdown and vaccinations. However, while the virus is being spread, i.e., early stage of a disease epidemic, it might be possible to track spreading patterns in terms of spatial and temporal characteristics.</p>
    <p id="Par23">According to Nextstrain’s August 2020 SARS-CoV-2 situation<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> reports, the virus has mutated over time as the virus spreads to different regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Different strains of the virus evolve as the virus spreads to different regions over time (see the Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S2). Based on the observations, there is no doubt that SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have different characteristics depending on regions and time but are not yet fully understood. In this paper, we define such unknown information in terms of spatial patterns and temporal patterns, respectively. Thus, understanding the spatial and temporal characteristics of virus spreading patterns is a very important task. However, our knowledge so far is limited to simply measuring how many patients have occurred geographically and temporally. Beyond the simple statistics, the spread at the level of individual patients can be investigated through an embedding space with spatial and temporal features.</p>
    <p id="Par24">The main goal of our study is to investigate the tracking of COVID-19 in terms of biological perspectives. When external factors such as global lockdown and vaccination are enforced, it is difficult to investigate the spreading potentials of COVID-19 per se, thus we analyzed the early spread pattern of COVID-19 using the SARS-CoV-2 sequences up to July 2020. In this work, we propose a deep learning method, AutoCoV that can track the early spread of COVID-19 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Tracking the virus spreading patterns of spatial and temporal characteristics was achieved by an auto-encoder based latent representation deep learning model. Since there are quite a number of mutations in a virus sequence, a sequence is preprocessed using <italic>k</italic>-mer, also known as <italic>n</italic>-gram in natural language processing for information theoretic filtering. Then, the input to AutoCoV is a set of informative <italic>k</italic>-mers for a virus sequence with spatial or temporal information. By augmenting an auxiliary classifier and a center loss objective function on the auto-encoder, we guided the latent representation to learn the spatial and temporal patterns. Formally, AutoCoV optimizes three objective functions, such as reconstruction loss, classification loss, and center loss, as shown in Eq. <xref rid="Equ9" ref-type="">9</xref>. In this paper, we used SARS-CoV-2 sequences from two different datasets: the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. As a result, we showed that our model outperformed baselines on an experiment of annotated SARS-CoV-2 sequences in the NCBI dataset. An extensive ablation study showed the contributions of each component and strategy used in AutoCoV. Furthermore, we demonstrated the robustness of the embedding space generated by AutoCoV using the NCBI dataset against an independent GISAID dataset.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The overall framework of the AutoCoV model. <bold>a</bold> Preprocessing of SARS-CoV-2 sequences: We transform the virus sequences into a <italic>k</italic>-mer vector.

      <title>Related works</title>
      <p id="Par25">Since the first outbreak of the COVID-19 virus in 2019, numerous papers have been published. Early papers conducted biological evolutionary and structure analysis of SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. As the number of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences increased, mutation-based research was conducted and cluster analysis was performed on sequences with the same mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Some papers statistically summarized spatial and temporal features according to the types of mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Recently, many studies have been conducted using machine learning technologies, for examples, diagnosing COVID-19 using medical images by applying convolutional neural network (CNN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], predicting antiviral drugs using natural language processing (NLP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], or using deep neural network (DNN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] to form a drug repurposing perspective. In addition, research on the current outbreak status and spread of COVID-19 using demographic or mobility data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and the impact of external factors such as global lockdown policies were also studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, there have been no studies on the spatial and temporal spread of COVID-19 utilizing the SARS-CoV-2 sequence.</p>
      <p id="Par26">Analyzing long biological sequences at the character level, i.e. single resolution, is a very difficult task. Although single nucleotide-based analysis may utilize more rich information about the sequences, large amounts of features may lead to the curse of dimensionality, especially in the long length of biological sequences. Therefore, it is important to use an appropriate encoding method that can reflect biological meaning while reducing the dimension of the sequence. There are simple but widely used methods of expressing the characteristics of the sequences such as one-hot encoding or <italic>k</italic>-mer encoding. One-hot encoding of the sequence data is straightforward and it has the advantage of preserving the positional information of the sequence, whereas the encoding length depends on the length of the sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. <italic>K</italic>-mer encoding, on the other hand, loses positional information, but it has the same encoding length for a fixed value of <italic>k</italic>, and has the advantage of being able to learn the local context of a biological sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, the sequences are very similar to each other both in length and of nucleotide compositions and only a small number of variants determine the pathogenic properties of the virus. There is also a study on the possibility of additional mutations occurring around mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Therefore, in this study, we used a <italic>k</italic>-mer based approach to encode the sequence to focus on the local context of the sequence rather than the location information.</p>
      <p id="Par27">There are many existing machine learning algorithms for biological sequences that utilize the <italic>k</italic>-mer information as input features of models in various ways and learn embedding vectors of the <italic>k</italic>-mers or the sequence itself. For example, word2vec [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] or doc2vec [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] based models were proposed such as BioVec [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], dna2vec [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], or Super2Vec [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Hybrid approaches of CNN and recurrent neural network (RNN) were also proposed to capture local contexts of <italic>k</italic>-mers and long-range interactions within the sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, most existing methods are designed for short-length of biological sequences and these methods have difficulty in learning embedding vectors of long-length sequences such as SARS-CoV-2.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The summary of datasets (as of 2020-07-17)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"/><th align="left">NCBI (5,210)</th><th align="left">GISAID w/o NCBI (61,210)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Subclass</td><td align="left"><p>S (1,246), L (266), V (130),</p><p>G (463), GR (418), GH (2,687)</p></td><td align="left"><p>S (4,328), L (3,856), V (4,418),</p><p>G (14,982), GR (19,316), GH (14,310)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Spatial</td><td align="left"><p>Asia (454), Oceania (403),</p><p>Europe (280), North America (4,073)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Asia (3,805), Oceania (2,151),</p><p>Europe (41,365), North America (13,889)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Temporal</td><td align="left"><p>Early (178), Middle (2,632),</p><p>Late (2,400)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Early (1,175), Middle (25,058),</p><p>Late (34,977)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Each dataset has three categories of SARS-CoV-2 characteristics: Pathogenic mutations (Subclass), Spatial, Temporal.

      <p id="Par28">SARS-CoV-2 sequences were obtained from two different databases: NCBI Virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/</ext-link>) and GISAID (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gisaid.org">http://www.gisaid.org</ext-link>). From NCBI Virus, we collected 7,031 sequences including SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence NC_045512, as of July 17, 2020. NCBI Virus sequences had spatial and temporal labels based on collected continent and date. And each sequence was fully annotated with information about the location of the genes. From GISAID, we collected 61,210 sequences, as of July 17, 2020. GISAID sequences had spatial and temporal labels as well as subclass labels based on pathogenic mutations defined by the GISAID nomenclature system.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The structure of AutoCoV.

      <title>Experimental setup</title>
      <p id="Par29">For input data of the model, we used 5210 sequences commonly contained in NCBI Virus and GISAID. Each sequence was about 30,000 bases in length and had spatial and temporal labels. For the spatial label, the sequences were divided into four classes based on the collected continents: ‘Asia’, ‘Oceania’, ‘Europe’, and ‘North America’. For the temporal label, the sequences were divided into three classes based on March 2020, when the spike protein mutation occurred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Based on March 2020, when the D614G mutation in which Aspartic acid (D) at position 614 of spike protein mutated to Glycine (G) occurred, the sequence before March 2020 in which there was no D614G mutation is labeled as ‘Early’ and the sequence in March 2020 in which the D614G mutation occurred is labeled as ‘Middle’. And the sequences after March 2020, when the D614G mutation has spread around the world, are labeled as ‘Late’. Mutations in non-protein-coding regions were also important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], but due to different sequencing techniques and sequencing lengths of each sequence, there were lost in some sequences. Thus, only the protein-coding regions from ORF1ab to the N gene were used for quality control of the sequence. Among the sequences only from GISAID, we excluded low-quality sequences such as sequences with lowercase nucleotide or more than 100 N’s, so we used 23,979 as an external dataset to test the robustness of the embedding space learned from the NCBI dataset (Detailed GISAID dataset preprocessing is described in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The details of datasets are listed in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. We split NCBI dataset into training, validation, test data split with 80:10:10 ratio with preserving the spatial/temporal label ratio and performed the stratified split 10 times. In the case of learning spatial patterns, class labels are ‘Asia’, ‘Oceania’, ‘Europe’, and ‘North America’ for supervised learning. Similarly, in the case of learning temporal patterns, class labels are ‘Early’, ‘Middle’, and ‘Late’. All reported figures and tables in this section were created using the test data only. Detailed structures and hyper-parameters of models are described in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p>
      <sec id="Sec6">
        <title>Baseline methods</title>
        <p id="Par30">The performances of AutoCoV on learning spatial and temporal patterns were compared with seven baselines belonging to the three categories: ‘Dimension Reduction’, ‘Unsupervised’, and ‘Supervised’. In case of ‘Dimension Reduction’, three conventional dimension reduction techniques were used such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The input data of the three methods was the same <italic>k</italic>-mer frequency matrix as AutoCoV. In case of ‘Unsupervised’, two sequence embedding methods such as dna2vec [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and seq2vec [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] were utilized. In the case of ‘Supervised’, two well-known deep learning models for nature language processing were utilized with augmentation of a classifier network (CF), which was similar with AutoCoV: Seq2Seq+CF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and BERT+CF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In the contrast with ‘Dimension Reduction’, the baselines of ‘Unsupervised’ and ‘Supervised’ used the raw genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 as the input data. Details are described in the Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p>

        <title>Evaluation metrics</title>
        <p id="Par31">Learning the spatial or temporal patterns of SARS-CoV-2 means that in the embedding space generated by the model, sequences of the same labels are well clustered and sequences of different labels are well separated while well predicting labels of the sequences. Given the spatial or temporal labels of the sequence as ground truth, we used two clustering metrics and one classification metric to measure how well the model learn spatial or temporal pattern in embedding space. The first clustering metric is label homogeneous score (LHS) that measures the purity of class labels within the cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]: <inline-formula id="IEq3"><alternatives><tex-math id="M3">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <title>Performance comparison of learning embedding spaces</title>
      <p id="Par32">We conducted experiments for learning spatial and temporal patterns of SARS-CoV-2. As qualitative results, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows 2D embedding spaces of SARS-CoV-2 in the view of each pattern. As quantitative results, Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> provides the results of the three metrics on each embedding space. From both results, AutoCoV outperformed the baselines in terms of learning the spreading patterns of the virus. We further investigated AutoCoV performance with two additional experiments: effects of different <italic>k</italic>-mer sizes and ablation study. From comparative experiments on varying lengths of <italic>k</italic> ranging from 1 to 7, we showed that when <italic>k</italic> is 6, it can cover the performance aspect of the model and the aspect of biological prior knowledge. Furthermore, in an ablation experiment to measure the contribution of each component of AutoCoV, we showed that AutoCoV, when all components were incorporated, has the best performance. Details of the two additional experiments are in the Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p>
      <sec id="Sec9">
        <title>Visualization of spatial and temporal patterns</title>
        <p id="Par33">For learning an embedding space representing spatial patterns, AutoCoV constructed the space that successfully distinguishes Asia and North America (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figs. S3(a)–(b) and S4(a)–(b)). Interestingly, the AutoCoV was the only one that could infer the spatial spread of SARS-CoV-2. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a showed that viruses were well-separated and well-clustered according to continents in the AutoCoV spatial embedding space, and the spread pattern of the virus from Asia through Europe and Oceania to North America could be inferred through the embedding space. This trend was similar to the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 until August, and it was consistent with the August 2020 report of NextStrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, without using subclass labels, AutoCoV also learned subclass characteristics simultaneously (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S5a). Among the baselines, UMAP showed reasonable spatial patterns, but the same regions were not well clustered. The other baselines showed results with all regions being mixed.</p>
        <p id="Par34">For learning an embedding space representing temporal patterns, AutoCoV distinguished middle and late time points of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figs. S3c–d and S4c–d). Furthermore, temporal spreading patterns of SARS-CoV-2 were only observed in the embedding space of AutoCoV. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b showed that the time points were well-separated in the AutoCoV temporal embedding space, and the temporal spread patterns of the virus could be inferred from the bottom center to the left and then to the right. Likewise, with learning spatial patterns, AutoCoV learned subclass characteristics simultaneously without subclass labels (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S5b). Among the baselines, dna2vec showed a similar time trend but most of the sequences were extremely tightly clustered, which can hardly be interpreted as the spreading patterns of the virus. Again, the other baselines showed results such as all-time points being mixed or projecting test data into the wrong time points (e.g. t-SNE).</p>

    <title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
    <sec id="Sec13">
      <title>Effectiveness of encoding schemes of SARS-CoV-2 sequences using <italic>k</italic>-mer</title>
      <p id="Par37">In general, supervised learning methods outperform unsupervised learning methods. Interestingly, however, the supervised learning methods (Seq2Seq+CF, BERT+CF) performed even worse than the unsupervised learning methods (dna2vec, seq2vec) or dimension reduction methods (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) in most LHS, MI, and F1 evaluations on both patterns. On the other hand, AutoCoV performed significantly better than unsupervised methods. We discuss why this happened in terms of the effectiveness of encoding schemes of SARS-CoV-2 sequences using <italic>k</italic>-mer.</p>
      <p id="Par38">AutoCoV extracted <italic>k</italic>-mer information from the sequence and transformed one sequence as a <italic>k</italic>-mer frequency vector with entropy filtering. In the AutoCoV encoding scheme, positional information of <italic>k</italic>-mers was lost. Meanwhile, Seq2Seq+CF and BERT+CF preserved the sentence structure with positional information of <italic>k</italic>-mers. Intuitively, keeping the positional information of <italic>k</italic>-mers seems more natural for biological sequences, but there is a good reason why the AutoCoV encoding scheme performed better. SARS-CoV-2 sequences are very similar to each other, and a small number of variants determine the pathogenic properties of the virus. The order of <italic>k</italic>-mers in the sequence is nearly identical, so it is not useful for distinguishing between SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Therefore, AutoCoV did not utilize the positional information and focused on <italic>k</italic>-mer count changes of the informative variants.</p>
      <sec id="Sec14">
        <title>Limitations and further studies</title>
        <p id="Par39">In experiments on NCBI and GISAID datasets, it was shown that AutoCoV can effectively model spatial or temporal patterns in the SARS-CoV-2 sequence. There are a number of limitations in our approach. While the <italic>k</italic>-mer encoding scheme of AutoCoV works well for SARS-CoV-2 sequences, this scheme may lose positional information. We can interpret which <italic>k</italic>-mers are important, but it is hard to know exactly where the <italic>k</italic>-mer is in the sequence. Therefore, analysis through additional learning is required to know the exact location of the important <italic>k</italic>-mer in the sequence. In addition, more find-grained information has been lost because temporal labels were discretized in the experimental setup. There may also be sampling bias issues because the amount of data for each label was not adjusted to reflect the prevalence of diffusion.</p>
        <p id="Par40">To compensate for these shortcomings, future studies include improving the interpretability of the model by adopting attention mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] or analyzing saliency map of <italic>k</italic>-mer vectors like compute vision domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. In addition, utilizing denoising techniques will enhance the robustness of the model and mitigate the effects of sequence noises. It also seems possible to improve model structures so that more fine-grained label information can be modeled in the embedding space using continuous label representation and unbiased manipulation of the label data.</p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p id="Par41">In this paper, we proposed AutoCoV that learned 2D embedding spaces for modeling the spatial and temporal patterns in the early spread of COVID-19. To the best of our knowledge, AutoCoV is the first of its kind that learns virus spreading patterns from the genome sequences. The technical contribution of this paper is that AutoCoV can effectively handle the long-length SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences using information theory and auto-encoder based deep learning model. The biological significance of AutoCoV is the ability to map SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences to 2D spaces that preserve the spatial and temporal patterns without knowing subclass information of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. In extensive experiments, AutoCoV outperformed current embedding spaces learning and visualization methods. The generalization power of the embedding space was demonstrated in a cross validation experiment using the NCBI dataset and in another experiment with an independent GISAID dataset. The main contribution of our work is that a machine learning approach is shown to be capable of learning the spread of COVID-19. We expect that the embedding space that can reflect temporal and spatial features can potentially be useful to track spread dynamics between sequences.</p>
        <p id="Par42">In closing this paper, we emphasize the importance and significance of learning the sequence embedding space for spatial and temporal patterns of the virus spread. A virus evolves into new types often with more aggressive characteristics even in the quarantined countries. Furthermore, infection among people can make different types of viruses, which makes the understanding of virus evolution more complicated. As of now, we do not have computational methods to model these complex spreading patterns spatially and temporally from the virus genome sequences. Existing studies have mainly studied virus propagation by external control factors such as lockout policies based on demographic data or mobility data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. As we showed in this study, methods for embedding or representation learning have potential for this important but challenging problem. We expect that comprehensive analysis of statistical methods based on demographic data and this type of embedding method will help characterize the rapidly evolving pandemics.</p>

We generated a <italic>k</italic>-mer vector of each sequence using protein-coding regions.

After sequence-level normalization, the <italic>k</italic>-mer feature level normalization is done by the standardization on each <italic>k</italic>-mer feature.

In the case of SARS-CoV-2 sequences, however, it is hard to construct well-separated embedding spaces due to the high similarity of sequences. To achieve the distinct latent representations according to spatial and temporal patterns, we adopt an auxiliary Classifier Network on the Auto-Encoder Network. This auxiliary network will predict spatial labels for learning spatial patterns or temporal labels for learning temporal patterns.

      <p id="Par51">Cross entropy loss with softmax layer guides the model to learn features that distinguish classes. However, it is insufficient to learn compact representations of data belonging to the same class [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. For this reason, Wen et al. proposed a new loss function called center loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. The basic concept of center loss is to minimize the distances between data within the same class.
