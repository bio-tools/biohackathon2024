    <abstract>
      <p>Both caloric restriction (CR) and resveratrol (RSV) have beneficial effects on obesity. However, the biochemical pathways that mediate these beneficial effects might be complex and interconnected and have not been fully elucidated. To reveal the common therapeutic mechanism of CR and RSV, we performed a comparative transcriptome analysis of adipose tissues from diet-induced obese (DIO) zebrafish and obese humans. We identified nine genes in DIO zebrafish and seven genes in obese humans whose expressions were regulated by CR and RSV. Although the gene lists did not overlap except for one gene, the gene ontologies enriched in the gene lists were highly overlapped, and included genes involved in adipocyte differentiation, lipid storage and lipid metabolism. Bioinformatic analysis of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences of these genes revealed that their transcriptional regulators also overlapped, including EP300, HDAC2, CEBPB, CEBPD, FOXA1, and FOXA2. We also identified 15 and 46 genes that were dysregulated in the adipose tissue of DIO zebrafish and obese humans, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis identified EP300, HDAC2, and CEBPB as common transcriptional regulators for these genes. EP300 is a histone and lysyl acetyltransferase that modulates the function of histone and various proteins including CEBPB, CEBPD, FOXA1, and FOXA2. We demonstrated that adiposity in larval zebrafish was significantly reduced by C646, an inhibitor of EP300 that antagonizes acetyl-CoA. The reduction of adiposity by C646 was not significantly different from that induced by RSV or co-treatment of C646 and RSV. These results indicate that the inhibition of EP300 might be a common therapeutic mechanism between CR and RSV in adipose tissues of obese individuals.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 310 million people worldwide are obese (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bessesen, 2008</xref>). Such estimates are particularly alarming given the strong association between obesity and various adverse health consequences, including atherosclerosis, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bessesen, 2008</xref>). CR can alleviate these deleterious conditions in obesity (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Guarente, 2013</xref>). However, eating less for the sake of creating a desirable metabolic profile is unlikely to gain widespread compliance (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Timmers et al., 2011</xref>). Accordingly, there has been an increasing interest in identifying compounds that elicit the beneficial effects of CR without requiring reduced calorie intake.</p>
    <p>Resveratrol is thought to mimic the effects of CR in obesity (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Guarente, 2013</xref>). In mice on a high-fat diet, RSV diminished total body fat content and decreased depots of epididymal, inguinal and retroperitoneal white adipose tissue (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Lagouge et al., 2006</xref>). In obese Zucker rats, the administration of RSV resulted in a significant reduction in plasma TGs, free fatty acids, cholesterol, and liver TGs when compared with untreated obese Zucker rats (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Rivera et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
    <p>The mechanism of how RSV exerts these favorable effects was proposed to be related to the induction of genes encoding oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial biogenesis molecules (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Chung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">de Ligt et al., 2015</xref>). Numerous data indicate that the activation of NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent protein deacetylase, SIRT1, is pivotal for the beneficial effect of RSV (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Chung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">de Ligt et al., 2015</xref>). SIRT1 catalyzes, among others, deacetylation and the activation of peroxisome proliferator gamma coactivator-1α, a cofactor in mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Chung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">de Ligt et al., 2015</xref>). However, the biochemical pathways proposed to mediate the beneficial effects of RSV are highly interconnected (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Chung et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that systems pharmacology might be required to fully elucidate the therapeutic mechanism of RSV in obesity.</p>
    <p>It was demonstrated that CR increases the expression of SIRT1 protein (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 2004</xref>) and that the beneficial effects of CR are mediated via SIRT1 (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Picard et al., 2004</xref>). However, the general up-regulation of Sirt1 expression was challenged by a study showing CR-regulated Sirt1 expression was tissue specific in mice (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, SIRT1-independent effects of CR were also reported (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Kaeberlein and Powers, 2007</xref>). These findings suggest there common therapeutic mechanisms between CR and RSV might be both dependent and independent of SIRT1.</p>
    <p>To identify the common therapeutic mechanism between CR and RSV, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis of adipose tissues from DIO zebrafish and obese humans with or without CR or RSV. Combined with bioinformatics analysis, we identified EP300, a histone and lysyl acetyltransferase, as a master regulator for genes dysregulated in obesity and normalized by CR and RSV. We also demonstrated that the inhibition of EP300 by a competitive inhibitor of acetyl-CoA reduced the adiposity of larval zebrafish. These results suggest that the inhibition of EP300 might be a common therapeutic mechanism of CR and RSV on adiposity in obesity.</p>

      <title>Zebrafish Husbandry</title>
      <p>Zebrafish were maintained according to the methods described by <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Westerfield (2007)</xref> with some modification. Briefly, zebrafish were raised at 28.5 ± 0.5°C with a 14 h/10 h light/dark cycle. Embryos were obtained via natural mating and cultured in 0.3 × Danieau solution [19.3 mM NaCl, 0.23 mM KCl, 0.13 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.2 mM Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, 1.7 mM HEPES, pH 7.2]. To induce the adult DIO model, we used a transparent zebrafish mutant line <italic>MieKomachi 001</italic> (<italic>MK001</italic>) that was created by crossing <italic>nacre</italic> and <italic>rose.</italic> For the experiments using larva, we used an albino zebrafish line that was obtained from the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology (Tübingen, Germany).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Adult DIO Zebrafish Model</title>
      <p>Female zebrafish at 4 mpf were assigned into three dietary groups: OF, OF + RSV, and control, with five fish per 2-L tank. Zebrafish in the OF and OF + RSV groups were fed three times per day with freshly hatched Artemia (corresponding to 60 mg cysts/fish/day). Zebrafish in the control group were fed freshly hatched <italic>Artemia</italic> (corresponding to 5 mg cysts/fish/day) once per day. Zebrafish in the OF + RSV groups were fed with gluten containing RSV (corresponding to 20 μg /fish/day) at 20 min before feeding <italic>Artemia</italic> in the morning. Zebrafish in the OF and control groups were fed with gluten without RSV at 20 min before feeding <italic>Artemia</italic> in the morning. Gluten with or without RSV were prepared as previously described (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Zang et al., 2011</xref>). The body weight and length of zebrafish were measured weekly throughout the study. Zebrafish length was measured from the head to the end of the body. Blood collection and TG measurement in the plasma were performed as described previously (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Oka et al., 2010</xref>). Staining visceral adipose tissues was performed as previously described (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Oka et al., 2010</xref>) except for the concentration of Nile Red (1 μg/ml) and the staining time (30 min). After staining, the visceral adipose tissues were observed with a fluorescence microscope (MZ 16F, Leica, Tokyo, Japan) using a GFP2 filter (Leica). The fluorescent intensity of Nile Red was calculated using Volocity 3D Image Analysis Software (Perkin-Elmer, Cambridge, MA, USA).</p>

      <title>Assessment of Adiposity in Larval Zebrafish</title>
      <p>Zebrafish at three dpf were treated with 2 μM C646, 200 μM RSV or 2 μM C646 and 200 μM RSV for 48 h. After the treatment, zebrafish were stained with Nile Red (5 ng/ml) for 30 min. After staining, zebrafish were rinsed in 0.3 × Danieau solution and anesthetized with 2-phenoxyethanol (500 ppm). <italic>In vivo</italic> imaging of the zebrafish was performed using a fluorescence microscope (SMZ25, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with a GFP-L filter (Nikon). The area stained with Nile Red in the abdomen was measured using Volocity (Perkin-Elmer).</p>

      <title>Transcriptome Analysis of Visceral Adipose Tissues of Female DIO Zebrafish</title>
      <p>The visceral adipose tissue of female DIO zebrafish overfed Artemia for 1 week (OF 1 w) or 5 weeks (OF 5 w), or overfed Artemia for 5 weeks with RSV (OF + RSV 5 w), were stained with Nile Red and collected by surgical extraction under a fluorescence microscope. The visceral adipose tissue was stored in RNA-later (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Total RNA was then extracted using an RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), qualified by an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and quantified using a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop ND-100, Wilmington, DE, USA). Fifty nanograms of total RNA from each visceral adipose tissue depot were converted into labeled cRNA using the Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent). Cy3-labeled cRNA (860 ng) was hybridized to Agilent Zebrafish Whole Genome Oligo Microarrays (G2519F) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The hybridized microarrays were scanned (Agilent G2565BA) and analyzed using Feature Extraction software (Agilent). The data were normalized using Limma (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>), a package in Bioconductor. Probes that passed four criteria (gIsSaturated, gIsFeatNonUnifOL, gIsPosAndSignif, gIsWellAboveBG) across the dataset were used for further analysis. RankProd analysis (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Hong et al., 2006</xref>) was performed to identify differentially expressed genes between two groups by calculating the false discovery rate (FDR). Differentially expressed genes (FDR &lt; 30%) were then converted to human orthologs using the Life Science Knowledge Bank (World Fusion, Tokyo, Japan). The gene symbols of human orthologs were used for functional analysis. The gene symbols of human orthologs were used for functional analysis.

      <title>Resveratrol Reduces Plasma Triglyceride and Visceral Fat in Diet-Induced Obese Zebrafish</title>
      <p>We previously demonstrated that CR after OF significantly lowered both plasma TG and visceral adiposity in zebrafish (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Oka et al., 2010</xref>). In this study, we first examined whether RSV could also exert these effects in the DIO zebrafish model. Adult female zebrafish were overfed with freshly hatched nauplii of <italic>Artemia</italic> that have a relatively high fat content compared with flake foods (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Oka et al., 2010</xref>) with and without RSV treatment (20 μg/day, 40 mg/kg body weight/day in 0.5 g zebrafish). The BMI of OF zebrafish was significantly increased compared with the BMI of control zebrafish after 1 week (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1A</xref></bold>). The BMI of zebrafish overfed with <italic>Artemia</italic> and treated with RSV (OF + RSV) was also significantly increased compared with the BMI of control zebrafish. However, the BMI of OF + RSV zebrafish was not significantly different from that of OF zebrafish. We then examined the effects of RSV on plasma TG. As shown in <bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1B</xref></bold>, plasma TG in OF zebrafish was significantly increased compared with that of control zebrafish. In contrast, plasma TG levels in OF + RSV zebrafish were significantly lower than in OF zebrafish. We also examined the effects of RSV on visceral adiposity in DIO zebrafish, which can be visualized by Nile Red staining (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Oka et al., 2010</xref>). As shown in <bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1C</xref></bold>, the fluorescent intensity of Nile Red in OF zebrafish was significantly higher than in control zebrafish. The fluorescent intensity of Nile Red in OF + RSV zebrafish was significantly lower than in OF zebrafish. These results suggest that RSV can reduce plasma TG and adiposity in DIO zebrafish, consistent with previous reports in mammalian obesity (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Rocha et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Timmers et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

      <title>Identification of Transcriptional Regulators for Genes Commonly Regulated by RSV and CR in DIO Zebrafish</title>
      <p>To identify common mechanisms of action between RSV and CR, we compared transcriptome data of visceral adipose tissue in DIO zebrafish with RSV or CR (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Oka et al., 2010</xref>). Although the correlation of change in gene expression between RSV and CR was low (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold>), we identified nine genes in common (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">S1</xref></bold>, Sheet 1) from 27 and 528 genes whose expression were changed by RSV (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6">S2</xref></bold>, Sheet 1) and CR (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6">S2</xref></bold>, Sheet 2), respectively. Gene ontology analysis revealed that 56 cell processes, including lipid peroxidation, lipid storage, and energy homeostasis, were enriched in the nine identified genes (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM7">S3</xref></bold>, Sheet 1). To reveal the molecular mechanism involved in the regulation of the expression of the nine common genes, we used iRegulon (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Janky et al., 2014</xref>) to identify master regulators of the co-expressed genes based on the genome-wide ENCODE ChIP-seq data. iRegulon identified 20 transcriptional regulators for the nine genes with a NES &gt;3 (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM8">S4</xref></bold>, Sheet 1). The network between these transcriptional regulators and their target genes is shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref></bold>. To validate the network identified by iRegulon, we used Pathway Studio (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Nikitin et al., 2003</xref>) to identify the master regulators of co-expressed genes using natural language processing based text mining. Pathway Studio identified 50 regulators for the nine common genes (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9">S5</xref></bold>, Sheet 1). Seven regulators were overlapped between iRegulon and Pathway Studio data. The network between the seven regulators and their target genes identified by Pathway Studio is shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref></bold>. The overlapping network correlated well with the data identified by iRegulon. For example, Pathway Studio identified FOXA1/FOXA2 as positive regulators of <italic>IGFBP1, TF</italic>, and <italic>UCP3</italic>. iRegulon also identified these three genes as targets of FOXA1/FOXA2 <bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM8">S4</xref></bold>, Sheet 1).</p>

    <title>Identification of Common Transcriptional Regulators Targeted by RSV and CR</title>
    <p>To reveal which transcriptional regulators might be involved in the common mechanism of RSV and CR, we performed <italic>K</italic>-Means clustering (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Soukas et al., 2000</xref>) of transcriptional regulators identified by iRegulon based on their NES (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM8">S4</xref></bold>). As shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref></bold>, the <italic>K</italic>-Means clustering classified these transcriptional regulators into seven clusters. The clustering revealed that HDAC2, CEBPB, and EP300 (Cluster 7) were transcriptional regulators for genes dysregulated in obesity and normalized by RSV and CR in both DIO zebrafish and obese human. NR2F2, POLR2A, CEBPD (Cluster 5), and FOXA1, FOXA2 (Cluster 6) were transcriptional regulators for genes dysregulated in DIO zebrafish and normalized by RSV and CR in both DIO zebrafish and obese humans. Gene ontology analysis revealed that 161 cell processes were enriched in the eight transcriptional regulators in Clusters 5, 6, and 7 (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM7">S3</xref></bold>, Sheet 5). Five cell processes (adipocyte differentiation, aging, energy homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and lipid storage) were overlapped with those enriched in genes dysregulated in obesity and normalized by RSV and CR in both DIO zebrafish and obese humans (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM7">S3</xref></bold>, Sheet 6). The network between these transcriptional regulators and cell processes identified by Pathway Studio is shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref></bold>. It was demonstrated that EP300 activates CEBPB, CEBPB, FOXA1, and FOXA2 by acetylation (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2013b</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Cesena et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Kohler and Cirillo, 2010</xref>).

      <title>Inhibition of EP300 Reduces Adiposity in Larval Zebrafish</title>
      <p>The network between EP300 and the target genes identified by iRegulon is shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref></bold>. It was demonstrated that EP300 increased the expression of <italic>TF</italic> (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhary and Skinner, 2001</xref>), <italic>IGFBP1</italic> (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Nasrin et al., 2000</xref>), <italic>NQO1</italic> (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Macoch et al., 2015</xref>), and <italic>LEP</italic> genes (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cascio et al., 2008</xref>). The expression of these genes increased in obesity (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref></bold>; <bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">S1</xref></bold>, Sheets 3 and 4) and was normalized by RSV and CR (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref></bold>; <bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">S1</xref></bold>, Sheets 1 and 2) in adipose tissues of zebrafish and humans. These results suggest that EP300 might be activated in obesity and that both RSV and CR may suppress the activity of EP300 in adipose tissues. To examine the effect of EP300 on adiposity, we used a selective EP300 inhibitor C646 that competes for AcCoA binding to EP300 (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bowers et al., 2010</xref>). As shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref></bold>, the abdominal area of larval zebrafish stained by Nile Red was significantly decreased by 2 μM C646, 200 μM RSV, or co-treatment of 2 μM C646 and 200 μM RSV. However, the reduction of adiposity was not significantly different among the three treatment groups. These results suggest that the inhibition of EP300 might be a major therapeutic mechanism of RSV. It was shown that CR decreased intracellular AcCoA (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Marino et al., 2014</xref>) suggesting that CR might inhibit EP300 through reducing AcCoA.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>In this study, we demonstrated that the inhibition of EP300 might be common therapeutic mechanism of CR and RSV in adipose tissues of obese individuals. EP300 is a transcriptional coactivator with various functions (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013a</xref>), including linking DNA-bound TF to basal transcription machinery, relaxing chromatin structure through its histone acetyltransferase activity, and modulating the function of various proteins through the lysyl acetyltransferase activity (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013a</xref>).</p>
    <p>It was demonstrated that EP300 acetylated FXR, a master regulator of lipid homeostasis (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Modica et al., 2010</xref>) and that the acetylation of FXR was constitutively activated in obesity (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Kemper et al., 2009</xref>). EP300 also activated the transcription of genes encoding TG synthetic enzymes (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bricambert et al., 2010</xref>). Disrupting the function of EP300 in mice resulted in the reduction of white adipose tissue and plasma TG (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bedford et al., 2011</xref>). These findings suggest that EP300 might be activated in obesity and that the inhibition of EP300 would be a potential therapeutic strategy in obesity.</p>
    <p>It was shown that RSV inhibited EP300 through the activation of SIRT1 (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Shakibaei et al., 2011</xref>). When activated, SIRT1 promoted the deacetylation of lysine residues on EP300, resulting in the inhibition of acetyltransferase activity of EP300 (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Kume et al., 2007</xref>). Because SIRT1 is also activated by CR (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Guarente, 2013</xref>), CR might inhibit EP300 through the activation of SIRT1. However, CR also decreases intracellular AcCoA through SIRT3 (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hebert et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, CR inhibited EP300 through the depletion of AcCoA in the heart and skeletal muscle of mice, leading to the deacetylation of cellular proteins and activation of AMP-dependent protein kinase (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Marino et al., 2014</xref>). These findings suggest that EP300 might be inhibited by RSV and CR in adipose tissues either dependently or independently of SIRT1.</p>
    <p>In this study, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis of adipose tissues from DIO zebrafish and obese humans to identify a common therapeutic mechanism of RSV and CR. There are multiple methods to identify common pathways using comparative transcriptome analysis. The simplest way is to identify DEG that overlap among different transcriptome data. For example, we identified 46 DEG that overlapped between obese human females and males. Among the DEG, several genes were also identified as DEG in other transcriptome analyses not included in this study. These genes include carboxyl esterase 1 (<italic>CES1</italic>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Jernas et al., 2009</xref>), NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 1 (<italic>NQO1</italic>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2011</xref>), cathepsin S (<italic>CTSS</italic>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2005</xref>), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (<italic>MMP9</italic>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2005</xref>). The expression of these genes was linked to adiposity (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Taleb et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Palming et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Jernas et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that the DEG replicated in multiple transcriptome data is a good and robust marker for obesity.</p>
    <p>However, the lists of DEG do not always overlap between the same intervention in different strains/species or between related interventions in the same strains/species (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Allison et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Antosh et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, the identification of overlapped DEG by comparative transcriptome analysis might be too stringent, resulting in overlooking important genes and pathways. To circumvent this, group testing is widely used. For example, the list of DEG from each transcriptome analysis can be compared with predefined gene sets related to specific functions calculating which gene sets are represented in the list of DEG at a level greater than that expected by chance alone (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Manoli et al., 2006</xref>). By comparing the gene sets significantly enriched in each list of DEG, common pathways can be identified among multiple transcriptome data. Using this group analysis, several pathways have been successfully identified as common targets of CR and RSV, including “chromatin assembly or disassembly” (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Barger et al., 2008</xref>). Functions related to chromatin were also identified as enriched categories in CR by another comparative transcriptome analysis (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Wuttke et al., 2012</xref>). In this study, we performed <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequence analysis as a group analysis and identified EP300 as a common therapeutic target of CR and RSV. Taken together, these findings suggest that both CR and RSV may normalize the dysregulation of chromatin functions by EP300.</p>
    <p>We also identified that the transcriptional regulators CEBPB and HDAC2 might be common therapeutic targets of RSV and CR. EP300 interacts with CEBPB at the promoter of targeted genes (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Rastogi et al., 2013</xref>) and HDAC2 and EP300 compete for binding to promoters of their target genes (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Meng et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, the binding regions of EP300, CEBPB, and HDAC2 in the promoters of transferrin (<italic>TF</italic>; <bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref></bold>), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (<italic>IGFBP1</italic>; <bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3</xref></bold>) and <italic>NQO1</italic> (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S4</xref></bold>), whose expression was increased in obesity and was normalized by CR or RSV (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref></bold>), overlap. This might explain why iRegulon identified CEBPB and HDAC2 as transcriptional regulators. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the activity of HDAC2 might be inhibited in obesity and normalized by CR and RSV. A previous study reported that mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 3 deficient mice were protected from DIO and that the activation of HDAC2 by increased phosphorylation of Ser394 had a major role in the protection (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2014</xref>). Further studies are required to examine whether HDAC2 is involved in the therapeutic mechanism of CR and RSV.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>We demonstrated that the inhibition of EP300 might be a common therapeutic mechanism of CR and RSV. To our knowledge, this is the first study to indicate EP300 might be a potential therapeutic target of CR and RSV in adipose tissues. Chemicals and natural products that inhibit EP300 might function as CR mimetics to reduce adiposity in obesity.</p>
