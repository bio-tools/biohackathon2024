      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>As the terminal clinical phenotype of almost all types of cardiovascular diseases, heart
failure (HF) is a complex and heterogeneous syndrome leading to considerable morbidity and
mortality. Existing HF-related omics studies mainly focus on case/control comparisons,
small cohorts of special subtypes, etc., and a large amount of multi-omics data and
knowledge have been generated. However, it is difficult for researchers to obtain
biological and clinical insights from these scattered data and knowledge. In this paper,
we built the Heart Failure Integrated Platform (HFIP) for data exploration, fusion
analysis and visualization by collecting and curating existing multi-omics data and
knowledge from various public sources and also provided an auto-updating mechanism for
future integration. The developed HFIP contained 253 datasets (7842 samples), multiple
analysis flow, and 14 independent tools. In addition, based on the integration of existing
databases and literature, a knowledge base for HF was constructed with a scoring system
for evaluating the relationship between molecular signals and HF. The knowledge base
includes 1956 genes and annotation information. The literature mining module was developed
to assist the researcher to overview the hotspots and contexts in basic and clinical
research. HFIP can be used as a data-driven and knowledge-guided platform for the basic
and clinical research of HF.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Heart failure (HF), the terminal phenotype of many cardiovascular diseases, is a complex
and heterogeneous syndrome (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). It is a growing public
health problem, leading to considerable morbidity and mortality (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Due to the extensive burden of the disease coupled with the complexity
of HF syndrome, the signs and symptoms are often deceptive and the suspected patients cannot
be fully diagnosed (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). With the development of
bioinformatics technology, many researchers have started to assist in the diagnosis of HF by
studying the molecular mechanisms and looking for biomarkers of HF. Currently, the genetic
and epigenetic mechanisms of HF have been extensively studied using multi-omics data and
genome-wide association analysis to demonstrate the genetic variations and transcriptional
comparisons, reveal the differential expression and epigenetic analysis, and show the
potential modification mechanisms.</p>
    <p>The high-throughput sequencing technology provides a new idea for the diagnosis and
treatment of HF. There has been a rapid accumulation of effective omics data and knowledge.
Discovering pathological mechanisms and mining knowledge from these data is an effective way
for basic and clinical researchers. However, the proliferation and independent dissemination
of data have brought significant challenges for researchers in data analysis to obtain
meaningful insights. Organizing and analyzing these data with HF as a unit can provide a
convenient way for researchers to quickly acquire effective datasets and knowledge. The
discovery of data mining will also provide an important basis for revealing disease
pathogenesis and clinical treatment.</p>
    <p>Currently, some databases for gene–disease associations and data collection are relatively
comprehensive, but do not focus on a specific disease. ClinVar is a public database that
collects genetic variants related to diseases. It integrates information on four aspects,
i.e. variation, clinical phenotype, empirical data and functional annotation (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). DisGeNET
provides information on gene–disease associations, variant–disease associations and
disease–disease associations by integrating data from expert-curated repositories,
genome-wide association (GWAS) catalogs, animal models and scientific literature (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Online
Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) focuses on the relationships between human genetic
variation and phenotypic traits (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). However, it is
very time-consuming to query and screen from these databases to obtain genetic information
about HF. Furthermore, the information on these datasets is scattered in Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), Sequence Read Archive (SRA) (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and other databases, and the relevant knowledge is
also diamond-shaped in various knowledge bases and literature. For clinical and scientific
workers, it is very difficult to retrieve and analyze data about HF without separate
centralized reflection. Therefore, a comprehensive data platform that contains datasets,
knowledge and tools for HF is necessary.</p>
    <p>To fill this gap, we focused on HF and attempted to construct an integrated platform
consisting of multi-omics data, easy-to-use tools and relevant molecular knowledge, namely
the Heart Failure Integrated Platform (HFIP), by automatically collecting and manually
organizing relevant datasets and knowledge, and performing intelligent matching analysis and
visualization tools on selected datasets. This platform is a valuable resource for
researchers and clinicians to conduct studies and practice in HF.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="s4">
    <title>Methods and results</title>
    <p>In order to build a comprehensive HF omics database, we acquired HF-related omics datasets
and genomic events from existing databases and text mining and performed data mining and
visualization with corresponding tools (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). HFIP
mainly includes five basic function modules: ‘Database’, ‘data automatic update’, ‘Tools’,
‘Knowledgebase’, and ‘Literaturediscovery’.</p>
    <fig position="float" id="F1" fig-type="figure">

      <graphic xlink:href="baab076f1" position="float"/>
    </fig>
    <p>Focusing on HF, we systematically interpreted a given disease name into a full set of
disease terms (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary
file1</xref>). Then, various types of omics datasets were collected based on this term set
to form a specialized disease database. In addition, an automatics collection tool was used
to update the newly released datasets.</p>
    <p>Gene- and dataset-oriented analysis and visualization tools were also provided separately.
The former was designed to reveal the gene variants, expression and regulatory activities in
different datasets, and the latter was developed to compare different disease progression
states. Both of them provide a flexible and easy-to-use web approach for public and user-own
data, which is important for basic and clinical researchers who are not familiar with
bioinformatics tools. Based on these systematically collected datasets, new molecular events
could be identified.</p>
    <p>To construct a complete knowledge base of HF-related genetic events, gene–HF associations
were recognized from all types of public databases and literature. All these associations
were integrated to form a complete disease-omics knowledge graph which could be used for
precision reasoning and decision for the diagnosis and treatment of HF.</p>
    <p>It is important to find a good research idea. Thus, a literature discovery module was also
designed to represent the research hotspots related to HF in this platform. The knowledge
about gene–HF associations extracted from this literature was also put into the
‘Knowledgebase’ to make the information about HF-related genes more abundant. Finally, an
interaction platform was established to facilitate direct data mining and knowledge
retrieval.</p>

      <title>Data collection</title>
      <p>The first step in data and knowledge collection, sharing, and exchange is to construct
the standardizing disease term set of HF. Considering lexical heterogeneity of HF, we
integrated the possible names from several sources: (i) UMLS, Unified Medical Language
System (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), (ii) ICD-10, International
classification of diseases-version 10, (iii) HPO, human-phenotype-ontology (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), (iv) MeSH, Medical Subject Headings, (v)
SNOMED-CT, Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms, (vi) Medscape, (vii)
DermIS, Dermatology Online Atlas, and (viii) DO, Human Disease Ontology (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Finally, a complete list of 45 disease terms was
obtained (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary
file1</xref>).</p>
      <p>Using the term set of HF as keywords, we collected HF-related datasets from the three
main repositories for multi-omics data, i.e. GEO, SRA and ArrayExpress (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). After manual calibration and curation, 253
datasets and about 7842 samples, including three omics, i.e. genome, transcriptome and
methylation (with the proportions of 5.00%, 92.08% and 2.92%, respectively), and three
species, i.e. <italic toggle="yes">H</italic><italic toggle="yes">omo sapiens</italic>,
<italic toggle="yes">R</italic><italic toggle="yes">attus norvegicus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">M</italic><italic toggle="yes">us
musculus</italic> (with the proportions of 33.18%, 19.90% and 46.92%, respectively),
were obtained to summarize the existing omics studies of HF (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>).</p>

      <title>Data mining and visualization</title>
      <p>Through carefully manual calibration, labels of disease progression, sample status,
organism and project descriptions have been added to each sample. Based on these labels,
users can screen, group and perform secondary data mining in a single dataset.
Gene-oriented and dataset-oriented search and analysis were provided. Some tools of
multi-omics data analysis were designed and integrated for all these datasets, including
differential expression analysis, variation annotations, network module detection, etc.
Corresponding visualizations were also provided, which can be used to reveal the internal
biological insight straightforwardly. Different tools can be intelligently filtered and
matched to each dataset of different omics characteristics. Take the dataset of
‘GSE100532’ as an example, the data mining process is as follows (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>): (i) clicking ‘DataMining’ to start data analysis, (ii)
clicking ‘Add to group’ to group samples, (iii) clicking ‘Click New Analysis for data
analysis’ to select data analysis process, (iv) setting the parameters, including
differential expression analysis and Annotate Variation (ANNOVAR) tool (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), (v) generating data analysis results, such as
differentially expressed genes, volcano maps, etc., (vi) accessing the gene list function
display and so on, such as enrichment and reactome, and (vii) displaying the result of

      <title>Automatic data update and curation</title>
      <p>In order to achieve continuous accumulation of data, an automatic updating module was
implemented by resolving the structural omics data records in the main public database.
According to the determined 45 HF items, an automatic extraction program was designed for
GEO and SRA databases. We used the R package ‘GEOmetadb’ (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), ‘GEOquery’ (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and ‘SRAdb’ (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) to periodically obtain the description of the
latest datasets and samples and download the selected data. As of 31 October 2019, the
system had automatically extracted 1206 datasets and 13 765 samples.</p>
      <p>In order to ensure the accuracy of the datasets related to HF, a review mechanism was
established. All automatically updated data were stored on the MongoDB database in the
form of metadata. The administrator can review and manage the data through the data update
management page, including adding labels to each sample. Based on the metadata description
information or the literature information, two labels, i.e. ‘Disease Status’ and ‘Group
Label’, will be manually added to each sample, and other labels can be obtained through
text mining. After manual review, the data can be released. They were downloaded,
processed and finally merged into the database.</p>

    <title>Knowledge collection</title>
    <p>In order to facilitate clinicians or researchers to quickly obtain HF-related genes, we
systematically integrated gene–HF associations from OMIM, ClinVar, DisGeNET and other
databases, as well as information from literature mining based on confirmed HF keywords. At
present, the knowledge base already contains 1956 HF-related genes and their corresponding
mutation sites. Each gene–HF association is supported by evidences, including publications,
representative sentences describing the association, and the HFIP score (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). The HFIP score was computed using a scoring
system based on Phenolyzer’s scoring model and knowledge automatically from literature
(<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The score range is 0 to 1 and concrete rules
are as follows:</p>
    <list list-type="roman-lower">
      <list-item>
        <p>Data collection: We first obtained genetic disease datasets from DisGeNET (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), Gendoo (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), OMIM (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), Orphanet (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and GWAS Catalog (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p>Data screening: The standardizing HF term set was matched with the gene–disease
association data to obtain the gene–HF associations.</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p>Extraction of gene–HF associations from literature: Based on text mining and machine
learning methods, we have discovered 4069 unique relationships among diseases and genes,
drugs, tests and surgery from approximately 150 000 articles related to HF. The
sentences describing gene–HF associations in the articles were displayed in the
knowledge base as supporting evidence, and the impact factors of the corresponding
articles were also saved.</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p>Construction of weighted model: Due to the differences in gene–disease data obtained
from different databases and articles published in journals of different quality, we
established a weighted model in order to get a comprehensive score. The different
databases and the description of the gene–HF associations in a single database were
given different scores according to the reliability of its expression. The scores of
gene–HF associations in DisGeNET and Gendoo were extracted. As for HGMD, it is
professional knowledge base information that has been manually verified, so its score is
set to 1. Others come from the scores of OMIM, GWAS Catalog and Orphanet after
normalization in Phenolyzer. The weight ratio between the knowledge bases was
HGMD:DisGeNET:Gendoo:OMIM:GWAS Catalog:Orphanet = 2:1.5:1.5:1:1:1. The impact factors
and the number of publications were also added to the weighted module as quantitative
indicators. The impact factor ranges correspond to the score of 0–1: 0.1, 1–2: 0.2, 2–3:
0.3, 3–4: 0.4, 4–6: 0.5, 6–8: 0.6, 8–10: 0.7, 10–15: 0.8, 15–20: 0.9 and &gt;20: 1. The
weight of knowledge base and literature mining was set to 0.6:0.4.</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p>The score of each gene was finally normalized to the range of 0–1. The weighted model
satisfies the following relationship (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>):</p>

    <title>Literature discovery and recommendation</title>
    <p>Researchers rely on knowledge to generate new assumptions, especially in the domain of
medicine. In order to automatically develop new hypotheses and predict the prevalence of
existing topics, literature-based discovery algorithms were applied to a large number of
published articles. Based on the key HF items, we systematically collected related knowledge
items from existing databases including OMIM, ClinVar, DisGeNET, Gendoo, HGMD, Orphanet,
Genome-Wide Association Studies database (GWASdb), Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD),
Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB), The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and genome
database (genomeDB) in the form of a triple of &lt;SUB, REL, OBJ&gt;, where SUB was
HF-related items, OBJ was the types of related entities such as gene, drug, lab tests, etc.,
and REL was the relationship between HF and the object entity. In this article, we have
collected all HF-related articles from PubMed (around 150 000 papers). Two types of analysis
were conducted to predict the future hot topics: (i) Singular value decomposition method was
leveraged to recommend brand new topics in the future. (ii) Time-series-based algorithm was
applied to predict the trend of known topics (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary file2</xref>). The former was designed to develop new topics in
the future, the latter was to predict the prevalence of a given research topic. All these
results constituted the ‘LiteratureBase’.</p>
    <p>The ‘LiteratureBase’ shows the field of HF-related analysis, journals, organizations and
countries with more reports on HF (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). Users
can enter the types of HF and genes in the search window to view the hot development trend
of the gene in different fields of HF and the hottest genes currently studied in this field

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>With the explosive growth of omics data, we have shifted from data accumulation to data
analysis. These data applications greatly rely on data mining and knowledge collection.
However, they are widely distributed in different locations in different forms. Thus,
integrating and managing these data and knowledge is the first step. In order to build an
integrated platform with HF as a theme, we collected a lot of HF-related datasets and
gene–HF associations, embedded many analysis and visualization tools, and finally
constructed a user-friendly web interface. This is crucial for the systematic investigation
of HF pathologies or molecular mechanisms.</p>
    <p>As a comprehensive platform for HF research, the HFIP provides enriched HF-related
datasets, 1956 HF-related genes, HF-related research hotspots and 14 visualization tools.
Each dataset in HFIP includes data description information such as GEO ID, omics type,
species, organism, disease status, and gene expression level and mutations. These data
labels and tools used in HFIP allow greater flexibility in performing data analysis and
visualization. The developed platform is very convenient and effective for scientific
research and clinical workers working on HF.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="s9">
    <title>Future work</title>
    <p>To provide new HF-related datasets, we will continuously update the datasets through the
modules of automatic updating and manual verification in HFIP. The gene–HF associations from
text mining will also be continuously added to the knowledge base, and the specific role of
genes on HF will be more clarified. This platform will help medical research to gain more
knowledge and assist clinical decision-making through the increased data and knowledge
accumulated in HFIP. The HFIP should also greatly contribute to a better understanding of
underlying mechanisms for complex HF disease.</p>
