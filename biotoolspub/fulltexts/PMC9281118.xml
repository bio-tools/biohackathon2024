        <title>Background</title>
        <p id="Par1">Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have helped investigators generate massive amounts of cancer genomic data. A critical challenge in cancer genomics is identification of a few cancer driver genes whose mutations cause tumor growth. However, the majority of existing computational approaches underuse the co-occurrence mutation information of the individuals, which are deemed to be important in tumorigenesis and tumor progression, resulting in high rate of false positive.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Results</title>
        <p id="Par2">To make full use of co-mutation information, we present a random walk algorithm referred to as DriverRWH on a weighted gene mutation hypergraph model, using somatic mutation data and molecular interaction network data to prioritize candidate driver genes. Applied to tumor samples of different cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas, DriverRWH shows significantly better performance than state-of-art prioritization methods in terms of the area under the curve scores and the cumulative number of known driver genes recovered in top-ranked candidate genes. Besides, DriverRWH discovers several potential drivers, which are enriched in cancer-related pathways. DriverRWH recovers approximately 50% known driver genes in the top 30 ranked candidate genes for more than half of the cancer types. In addition, DriverRWH is also highly robust to perturbations in the mutation data and gene functional network data.</p>

      <sec>
        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p id="Par3">DriverRWH is effective among various cancer types in prioritizes cancer driver genes and provides considerable improvement over other tools with a better balance of precision and sensitivity. It can be a useful tool for detecting potential driver genes and facilitate targeted cancer therapies.</p>

    <title>Background</title>
    <p id="Par16">Cancer is a complex genetic disease characterized by abnormal and uncontrolled cellular growth, which is caused primarily by the accumulation of genomic alterations that together enable malignant growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have generated massive amounts of cancer genomic data, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which provides somatic mutation landscapes to better characterize the molecular signatures of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. There is a consensus viewpoint on tumorigenesis that only a few mutational events occurring in a set of genes (called “cancer driver genes”) affect the homeostatic development of a set of key cellular functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Discovery of these cancer driver genes across various tumor types is a key step in understanding tumor biology and developing targeted anticancer therapies.</p>
    <p id="Par17">A number of computational tools have been developed to identify cancer driver genes from multidimensional genomic data. Most of these tools can be classified into three categories based on their basic principles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Frequency-based approaches define that the most commonly occurring mutation are more likely to be drivers, such as MutSigCV and MuSic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Unfortunately, methods based on frequency are underpowered for uncovering low recurrently driver genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Functional impact-based approaches, such as OncodriveFM, integrate multiple-domain information to predict the functional impact of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, most of these methods use machine learning based models. Building either a gold-standard positive data set or a negative data set for such model is a difficult task, and that restricts the use of these methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The third category is network-based methods enlightened by the observation that mutations in a cancer genome tend to converge on a few biological pathways, attempt to identify groups of driver genes based on prior knowledge of pathways and proteins or genetic interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A tool named DawnRank adopts PageRank algorithm to rank potential drivers based on their impact on the overall differential expression of the downstream genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. HotNet2 uses a random walk with restart algorithm for identification of mutated subnetworks, in which the mutation frequency of each gene and the frequencies of its network neighbors are considered and hub genes are often yielded with highly predicted scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This kind of methods have advantages in their ability to identify driver genes with low recurrence and improve the accuracy of predicting driver genes to some extent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par18">Despite the rapid progress in computational approaches to prioritize cancer driver genes with the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies, the false positive rates of these existing methods are still too high. In addition, there are evidences showing that driver gene co-occurring may play a key role in cancer initiation and progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Because the activation or inactivation of one given driver gene is usually not sufficient to induce tumorigenesis, multiple mutations in different driver genes have to cooperate to gradually transform normal cells into precursor lesions and subsequently invasive and metastatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Among majority of the published methods, the practice of putting single gene mutation frequency as input information could result in the loss of all the co-occurring alternations information of the individual tumors. In this study, we introduced a weighted hypergraph model and present a novel tool DriverRWH by integrating mutation profile and PPI network data to predict driver genes. Hypergraph is a generalization of simple graphs where its edges, called hyperedges, are allowed to connect arbitrary number of vertices, which makes it suitable for representation of high-order relations and it can be used to model biology network, data structure, computations and a variety of other systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Herein, we adopted hyperedges to represent the co-exist relationship among mutated genes in individuals, so the problem of information loss of co-occurring alternations can be avoided in a certain extent. We next specified the weights of mutated genes in each hyperedge according their interaction in PPI network and construct the weighted hypergraph. Thereafter, we generalized a random walk algorithm to the weighted hypergraph. Finally, we ranked all the candidate mutated genes for the given cancer type. To verify our method, we applied DriverRWH to 31 cancer types from TCGA and found that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art tools for the majority of cancer types regardless of which reference network we use. We also evaluated the robustness of our method and found that DriverRWH is highly robust to various data perturbations.</p>

      <title>Overview</title>
      <p id="Par19">In this study, we proposed DriverRWH, which uses random walk on weighted hypergraph to prioritize the driver genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Firstly, for a given cancer type, a hypergraph was constructed basing on mutation profile, wherein tumor samples are presented as hyperedges and mutant genes are presented as vertices. Secondly, according to our hypothesis that a gene is more likely to be a driver gene if it is highly associated with other mutated genes, we differentiated genes within a hyperedge of sample in accordance with their degrees in the corresponding subnetwork of the PPI network. Then, we adopted a probabilistic weighted random walk that take advantage of the hypergraph structure, and carried out this iteratively. After some steps, the random walk would stabilize, producing a score for each mutated gene. At last, all candidate mutant genes are ranked in descending order based on their score.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Overview of DriverRWH. <bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold> Construction of the weighted hypergraph model using somatic mutation profiles of a given cancer type and a PPI network. Each sample is indicated with colored circular area (hyperedge) which contains all the mutated genes (vertices) of individual.

      <p id="Par21">After construction of the hypergraph, a specified subnetwork is generated for each sample, based on the mutated genes and their interaction in the PPI network. According to our hypothesis that a gene is more likely to be a driver gene if it is highly associated with other mutated genes, a fairly standard choice of the weight of vertices in each hyperedge are their degrees in the corresponding induced subnetwork of the PPI network.</p>
      <p id="Par22">Then, we developed a random walk process on the weighted hypergraph. Similar to a random walk on a simple graph, this walk is a type of Markov process, which is seen as the transition between two vertices. Note that the transition on the hypergraph occurs only if two vertices are incident to a hyperedge, so the random walk on the hypergraph is defined to be a two-step process. In the first step, the surfer selects a hyperedge <inline-formula id="IEq10"><alternatives><tex-math id="M27">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <title>Performance evaluation</title>
      <p id="Par29">To evaluate the method, an unbiased comprehensive known cancer gene set is needed. Unfortunately, such a gold-standard set of cancer genes is currently unavailable. Alternatively, we used four complementary cancer gene sets derived from various sources as the reference driver gene set for all the cancer types. First, 616 cancer genes were downloaded from the Cancer Gene Census (CGC) database, which includes genes for which mutations have been causally implicated in cancer and is widely used as a gold-standard cancer gene set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Second, the list of HiConf cancer gene panels consists of 99 driver genes that have previously been detected through genetic criteria and that could plausibly be detected with exome sequencing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The third set has 291 high-confidence cancer driver genes identified by a rule-based method (HCD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The fourth set contains 125 driver genes defined by the "20/20 rules", which identifies Mut-driver genes based on the characteristic mutational patterns for oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Now that each cancer gene set is biased toward particular features or study methods, we utilized a union of these four lists as the reference driver gene set, with a total of 785 genes. This operation can reduce the bias caused by using a single reference gene list to some degree. Using aforementioned reference driver genes as a benchmark, we generated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and areas under the curve (AUCs) to evaluate the true positive and false positive rate. For practical reasons, only top-ranked candidate genes might enter into follow-up experimental validation. Considering that the high performance of prioritization for all genes cannot guarantee successful prioritization for the top ranked candidates, we also assessed the number of known driver gene recovered in the top 20, 50, 100,150 and 200 candidate genes.</p>
      <p id="Par30">Due to the diversity of cancer types, we are more interested in tumor-specific drivers than the general common drivers across all tumor types. We downloaded IntOGen database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.intogen.org/download">https://www.intogen.org/download</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This database harnesses the strengths of different driver prediction methods and provides a tumor-specific driver genes list, which is considered to be the best trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. This list contains 31 types of cancer among which Kidney Chromophobe (KICH) has 7 specific drivers (minimum) and Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC) has 55 (maximum). All of the above lists are shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>. From an application point of view, we should assess the ability of our method to identify novel driver genes that may not have been discovered in IntOGen. The genes in top 200 candidate gene list predicted by DriverRWH with both HumanNet and STRINGv10 while not in the tumor-specific drivers were considered to be potential novel drivers. From the functional perspective, these genes were evaluated by the biological analysis using DAVID on-line database, CancerGeneNet and iGMDR database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p>
      <p id="Par31">We leveraged a literature mining method named CoCiter, which calculates the co-citation significance between predicted driver genes and the keywords cancer type, ‘driver’ and ‘cancer’ to verify the top 30 significant genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The higher co-citation score implicates the stronger association between the genes and the key terms. Without loss of generality, we compared DriverRWH with 24 driver gene prediction methods across 31 cancer type, some of which identify significant drivers by <italic>P</italic>-value (the genes with FDR adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) and the rest of methods provide the priority scores for candidate driver genes (the top 30 genes are selected as significant drivers). It is acceptable for the reason that the median number of significant genes for other methods in all data sets is 30.</p>

      <title>Known driver genes have higher degree in the PPI network</title>
      <p id="Par32">In DriverRWH, we hypothesized that a gene is more likely to be a cancer driver if it is prone to associate with other mutated genes in cancer. This hypothesis has already been proposed in some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. To further validate it, we analyzed the linkage of mutated genes in the PPI network. For a given cancer type, an induced subnetwork of the PPI network which just contains mutated genes from all samples was built. The genes that mutated at least once in a cancer type were divided into two groups according to whether they are in the reference driver gene set (the union of CGC, HiConf, MCD, Mut-driver, with a total number of 785 genes): known driver genes and the others. We calculated the degree of vertices in the induced subnetwork. Taking the three cancer types LUSC, BRCA and UCEC for illustration, we found the degrees of known driver genes were significantly larger than those of the other mutant genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.001). This result suggests that cancer driver genes were adjacent to more mutated genes than the others. The same analysis using HumanNet is also available (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig S1).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Boxplot comparing the degrees of known driver and the other genes in induced subnetwork.

      <title>Performance of DriverRWH</title>
      <p id="Par33">To evaluate the performance of our method, we compared our method from three aspects, prediction of known driver genes, functional enrichment analysis and literature mining analysis. Firstly, we implemented six prioritizing methods, MutsigCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], DawnRank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], MinNetRank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], Subdyquency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], Gravity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and OncodriveFML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] on three cancer types, namely Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), Breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), and Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC) (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). In order to eliminate the deviation brought by the background network, we operated DriverRWH and the other three network-based methods (MinNetRank, Subdyquency, and Dawnrank) basing on the same network, STRINGv10 and HumanNet respectively. Then, we compared DriverRWH with 24 other driver gene prediction tools to evaluated its performance across 31 cancer types. Lastly, we verified the robustness of our method by testing the performance in perturbed data where the mutation data and network data were extracted randomly with different size.</p>

        <p id="Par35">Using reference driver genes as benchmarks, we generated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. When using STRINGv10 as background network, DriverRWH outperforms the other six tools. in terms of sensitivity and specificity in identifying known driver gene (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). We further assessed the predictive power for the top-ranked candidate genes. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B, we observed that DriverRWH identified more known cancer driver genes by its top 20, 50, 100, 150 and 200 genes. Furthermore, the number of know driver gene retrieved by DriverRWH with STRINGv10 network in its 20 top-ranked candidates is more than half of it. When HumanNet was used, DriverRWH is still significantly better than the others methods (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig S2).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Prediction performance of DriverRWH based on the reference driver set. <bold>A</bold> ROC plots of DriverRWH and other six methods.

        <p id="Par36">To assess the ability of DriverRWH of discovering potential novel cancer driver genes, we considered the genes in the 200 top ranked candidate genes predicted with both HumanNet and the STRINGv10 while not in tumor-specific drivers list, resulting in 72 genes after screening. Biological enrichment analysis using DAVID against Genetic Association Database (GAD) shows that 36 genes (48.6%) are cancer-related (<italic>P</italic>-value = 5.92 × 10<sup>–6</sup>, FDR = 5.92 × 10<sup>–4</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In particular, these genes are enriched for "lung cancer" (<italic>P</italic>-value = 1 × 10<sup>−3</sup>, FDR = 0.1217). Furthermore, the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis for the potential drivers is encouraging. 8 genes (11.2%) are significantly enriched in pathway: "PI3K - Akt signaling pathway" (<italic>P</italic>-adjust &lt; 0.05), which is significantly related to lung cancer (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig S3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p>
        <p id="Par37">Specifically, using the top 30 candidate genes as significant driver, we searched these genes in co-citer website by the key terms ‘Cancer’, ‘Driver’ and ‘Lung’. As Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows, some significant well-known driver genes like TP53, PTEN and PIK3CA are near the top of the list. Although they are also identified by most of other methods, their ranking fell behind ours. The well-known suppressor TP53 which disrupts the cell cycle arrest and the apoptosis pathways in human cancer ranks first in our method, but it ranks 527th in Gravity algorithm. The PTEN is proved to be related to small cell lung cancer, which is an admitted tumor suppressor gene with phosphatase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. It is co-cited with ‘Lung’ and ‘Cancer’ for 253 and 2597 times, which is regarded as driver genes in 35 publications. The PTEN ranks the 16th in our list but ranked 44th in MinNetRank and 588th in Gravity. The mutation of PIK3CA gene can lead to abnormal enhancement of the catalytic activity of PI3Ks and promote the carcinogenesis of cells in lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. It ranks 7th in our method but 22th in MutsigCV and OncodriveFML, and 473th in MinNetRank. On the other hand, KDR (Kinase insert domain-containing receptor), ranked 24th, was reported to play a critical role in the metastasis of cancer and is used as a molecular target in cancer therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Co-cited with "Cancer" for 207 times and ‘Lung’ for 105 times, KDR even not deemed as a diver gene in lung cancer and can be thought as a potential driver.

        <p id="Par38">We adopted the GAD and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis and found these significant driver genes enrich in the small cell lung cancer, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, etc., which are significantly related to lung cancer (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig S3). The hallmarks of cancer are defined as a set of crucial functional abilities acquired by human cells as they move from normalcy to neoplastic growth states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. We linked these significant drivers to hallmarks of cancer using CancerGeneNet online database which calculates the shortest paths between genes and phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Half of the top 30 genes could be associated with hallmarks of cancer. KDR, one of the potential drivers we mentioned above, is linked to “Angiogenesis”, “Cell Death”, “Differentiation”, “DNA Repair”, “Glycolysis”, “Immortality”, “Inflammation”, “Metastasis” and “Proliferation” (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). In order to assess the drug sensitivity of these significant drivers, we performed gene-drug analysis using online database iGMDR, which shows that 73.3% of significant genes are druggable (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>).</p>

Notably, 29 genes (44.6%) are enriched for "CANCER" (<italic>P</italic>-value = 1.67 × 10<sup>–4</sup>, FDR = 1.67 × 10<sup>–4</sup>) and 12 (18.5%) are enriched for "breast cancer" (<italic>P</italic>-value = 2.15 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, FDR = 0.0087).

        <title>Robustness of DriverRWH</title>
        <p id="Par50">To test the robustness of DriverRWH, we applied our method to perturbed data where the mutation data and network data were shuffled randomly (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). In detail, for the mutation data, two types of perturbations were taken: (1) randomly selecting 50% and 10% of the samples and (2) randomly selecting 50% and 10% of the original mutation information in the somatic mutation matrix. With 20 repeats, we used only 50% and 10% of samples and 50% of mutation information. There is no significant decrease in terms of the AUC scores and the cumulative number of recovered driver genes. If only 10% of mutation information was retained, there would be a slight decrease. It’s worth noting that the performance of the top 20 candidates was always at a high level. For the network data, two forms of perturbation were also taken: (1) randomly selecting 50% and 10% of the original network information and (2) using PPI data with 50% and 10% noise added. There was also only a minor decrease in the AUC scores and the cumulative number of recovered cancer genes. A similar conclusion could be obtained when performing robust analysis basing on HumanNet (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig S8). These results suggest that the perturbation of mutation data and the network did not seriously affect the result, indicating that DriverRWH is highly robust to the quality of the input data. <fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Robustness of DriverRWH. <bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold> Boxplots of the effects of different data perturbations on the performance of DriverRWH.

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par51">Recent years, many methods have been developed to distinguish driver genes from passengers. Limited by the design of the simple network model, most of them are incapable of expressing the many-to-many multiple association relationship. The mutation profile was always compressed into the mutation frequency of genes, resulting in the loss of co-mutation information for individual samples. In this study, we propose a network-based method DriverRWH, which has the capability of effectively integrating the mutation and PPI network data to predict cancer driver genes. The novelty of our method lies in the introduction of a weighted hypergraph model, which is constructed to simultaneously capture two class of relation among mutated genes in individual samples: 1) high-order relations were captured by storing hundreds of mutated genes in a hyperedge for each sample. 2) using the same mutated genes as above, an induced subnetwork of PPI network can be generated by preserving mutated genes and their interaction in the background network, which represents the pair-wise relations between mutated genes. Our model retains complete co-mutation relations for the mutated genes in individual tumors and these interactions in PPI network, which can adequately embody the implicit inherent peculiarity of them and avoid the loss of information. Taking advantage of hypergraph structure, we extended the typical random walk process on a simple graph to a probabilistic weighted random walk on hypergraph.</p>
    <p id="Par52">Using a reference driver gene set as a benchmark, DriverRWH consistently outperformed the other six state-of-art prioritization methods in terms of the ROC analysis, rank of driver genes and the cumulative number of known driver genes recovered in the top-ranked candidate genes. Moreover, some new unknown potential driver genes which are co-cited by some cancer associated literatures also can be discovered by DriverRWH, meanwhile the high-ranking genes enrich in some significant cancer pathway. At last, taking top 30 as predicted candidate driver genes, we can compare DriverRWH with other non-ranking methods. The results shows that DriverRWH achieves a higher performance than four prioritization methods and 19 other non-ranking methods across 31 cancer types.</p>
    <p id="Par53">Despite of these encouraging results, there are several limitations in the current model. First, for TCGA data, tumor heterogeneity may increase the data bias, and future work should be done to reduce false-positive discoveries by using single-cell genomics data. Second, DriverRWH relies on a broad context molecular network that is still incomplete at present, so refined gene functional networks in the near future could improve the performance of our method. A cancer-specific network might better represent the natural interactions of genes in cancer and potentially provide a more reliable network. Third, our method focuses on general driver gene detection but does not aim to offer personalized means of diagnosis, which is more useful in real applications. In the future, we plan to extend our method to discover drivers in personalized manner.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p id="Par54">Recently, many computational methods and tools have been proposed to identify driver genes. However, long-tail distribution of the mutation frequency of genes in cancer genomes remains a major concern. There are many widely accepted methods based on mutation frequencies, but they fail to comprehensively consider the co-mutation information in individuals. Considering hypergraph has unique advantages of retaining complete co-occurrence information, we introduced the hypergraph theory in driver gene prediction, thus compensating for the co-mutation information loss issue by existing methods. For each hyperedge, degrees of vertex in the corresponding subnetwork of the PPI network were utilized to design the weighted hypergraph, through which we realized the integration of the mutation data and the PPI data. Subsequently, motivated by PageRank algorithm, we implemented the random walk with restart on the hypergraph, and proposed a novel approach DriverRWH to prioritize mutated genes. As demonstrated in this paper, DriverRWH not only excels existing methods in the identification of known driver genes but also is capable of discovering potential driver genes. Furthermore, the model behaves robustly under the perturbation of mutation data and network data. Our results show that DriverRWH can be a useful tool for prioritization driver genes.
