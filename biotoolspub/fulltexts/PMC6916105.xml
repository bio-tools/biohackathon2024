        <title>Background</title>
        <p id="Par1">Accurate identification of real somatic variants is a primary part of cancer genome studies and precision oncology. However, artifacts introduced in various steps of sequencing obfuscate confidence in variant calling. Current computational approaches to variant filtering involve intensive interrogation of Binary Alignment Map (BAM) files and require massive computing power, data storage, and manual labor. Recently, mutational signatures associated with sequencing artifacts have been extracted by the Pan-cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) study. These spectrums can be used to evaluate refinement quality of a given set of somatic mutations.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Results</title>
        <p id="Par2">Here we introduce a novel variant refinement software, FIREVAT (FInding REliable Variants without ArTifacts), which uses known spectrums of sequencing artifacts extracted from one of the largest publicly available catalogs of human tumor samples. FIREVAT performs a quick and efficient variant refinement that accurately removes artifacts and greatly improves the precision and specificity of somatic calls. We validated FIREVAT refinement performance using orthogonal sequencing datasets totaling 384 tumor samples with respect to ground truth. Our novel method achieved the highest level of performance compared to existing filtering approaches. Application of FIREVAT on additional 308 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) samples demonstrated that FIREVAT refinement leads to identification of more biologically and clinically relevant mutational signatures as well as enrichment of sequence contexts associated with experimental errors. FIREVAT only requires a Variant Call Format file (VCF) and generates a comprehensive report of the variant refinement processes and outcomes for the user.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p id="Par3">In summary, FIREVAT facilitates a novel refinement strategy using mutational signatures to distinguish artifactual point mutations called in human cancer samples. We anticipate that FIREVAT results will further contribute to precision oncology efforts that rely on accurate identification of variants, especially in the context of analyzing mutational signatures that bear prognostic and therapeutic significance.

    <title>Background</title>
    <p id="Par39">High-throughput sequencing technology has led to an explosion in the sheer volume of genomic data in the past decade. Because this technology produces genome-wide somatic mutation profiles within a reasonable timeframe and at a reasonable cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], many research groups, particularly International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), have produced population-scale whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) datasets from most common cancer types. As a consequence, at least 100,000 tumor samples have been sequenced and computationally analyzed to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The vast majority of the sample-specific mutation calls, usually in Variant Call Format (VCF), are publicly available through online databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which are invaluable sources of future genome studies and precision oncology. Simultaneously, tumor samples continue to be sequenced in hospitals to inform clinical decisions.</p>
    <p id="Par40">However, as sequencing data are produced and analyzed by heterogeneous groups, marked differences in the precision and sensitivity of the mutation calls become apparent. Due to variations in cost, capacity, and approach to bioinformatic analysis, provisional mutation calls include numerous false positives and negatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Sometimes, mutation calls are contaminated by experimental artifacts that accumulate during tissue handling and sequencing procedures, such as preparation of tissues into formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, 8-oxoG-mediated errors, chimeric reads, and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Artifactual variants have been shown to be a major culprit of clinical misinterpretations. In a routine genotyping of <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations in metastatic colorectal cancer patients, 53 (4.7%) out of 1130 FFPE samples had <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations that were validated as artifacts due to DNA fragmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In another study validating the detection of the T790M mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (<italic>EGFR)</italic> gene in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, up to 48.5% of T790M mutations were FFPE-related artifacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Moreover, in a clinical trial that investigated the efficacy of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) erlotinib in NSCLC patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], previously unidentified <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations were reported. The study concluded a lack of survival benefits in using erlotinib for patients with <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations and no clinical evidence to distinguish <italic>EGFR</italic>-mutant and wild-type patients for administration of the TKI. However, these novel mutations were later shown to be artifacts arising from the paraffin fixation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Therefore, false positive calls should be systematically eliminated for accurate downstream genome analysis at a population scale.</p>
    <p id="Par41">To eliminate false positives, somatic variant refinement is usually performed and often involves manual inspection of binary alignment map (BAM) files or experimental validation. However, the manual nature of this task may hamper reproducibility and scalability. To address this issue, a standard operating procedure for manual review has been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], but the process remains labor-intensive and time-consuming. While machine learning- and deep learning-based approaches to variant calling and refinement have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], results generated from these black-box models lack human interpretability, which hinders their widespread usability. In addition, these intensive bioinformatic analyses often require re-exploration of raw datasets (i.e., BAM files), necessitating massive computing power and data storage. Sometimes, the acquisition of original BAM files for publicly available mutation calls is technically intricate due to the large file size. Collectively, flexible and comprehensive algorithms that allow quick mutation screening and efficient variant refinement are imperative for conducting downstream analyses at a population scale using VCF files.</p>
    <p id="Par42">Recently, the Pan-cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) consortium generated 65 single-base substitution (SBS) mutational signatures from over 4600 whole cancer genomes and 19,000 cancer exomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]; these signatures have been incorporated as version 3 into the v89 release of Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Each of the signatures exhibits an expected spectrum of mutations by certain mutational processes. For example, one of the signatures, termed SBS7, features preferential C&gt;T mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], whereas SBS4, a mutational spectrum of tobacco smoke exposure, is characterized by C&gt;A mutations with a strong transcriptional strand bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Interestingly, a subset of these signatures is thought to be artifact-mediated calls. In fact, the single nucleotide substitutions observed in these artifactual signatures were shown to be enriched in false positive variant calls by a previous investigation on the reliability of WES in breast cancer samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Signatures that correspond to the enriched contexts are also reportedly correlated with germline variant contamination and DNA damage during experimental processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These findings suggest the feasibility of using mutational signatures to perform variant refinement.</p>
    <p id="Par43">Here we present FInding REliable Variants without ArTifacts (FIREVAT), an open source software toolkit that eliminates sequencing artifacts from biologically and clinically relevant point mutations in human cancer samples. Our toolkit automatically decomposes the spectrum of mutation calls in user-supplied VCF files into 65 known mutational signatures, and filters variant calls that better fit error signatures. FIREVAT outputs a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) report for each sample that undergoes variant refinement along with VCF files of refined and artifactual mutations, which can be used for downstream analysis. FIREVAT is implemented as an R package and can run on computers with limited resources such as a laptop. We validate the performance of FIREVAT by carrying out various benchmark experiments on three publicly available mutation callsets comprising 678 tumor-normal pairs obtained from multi-center validated sequencing, multiple cancer types, and multi-region WES. Along with variant refinement optimized for each sample, our novel evaluation method implemented in FIREVAT can be used as a proxy for quality control of other post variant calling efforts.</p>

      <title>Overview of FIREVAT</title>
      <p id="Par44">Unrefined mutations can lead to inaccurate mutational signature analysis inundated with artifactual signatures that obscure the identification of etiologically relevant mutational patterns (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Note S1, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figures S1–S4). FIREVAT addresses this problem by performing variant refinement guided by mutational signatures known to be representative of sequencing artifacts. By iteratively evaluating weights attributed to sequencing artifact signatures, FIREVAT determines optimal filtering cutoff values that effectively separate artifactual variants from real variants, thereby isolating biologically and clinically relevant mutagenesis signatures (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).
<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the FIREVAT workflow. The top panel represents the conventional workflow for processing sequencing data of the tumor and matched normal genomes. Sequencing artifacts are introduced in various steps of the experimental process. After calling variants with software such as MuTect2 and Muse, manual filtering is performed to mitigate false positives. FIREVAT automates this variant refinement task by leveraging the COSMIC mutational signatures (version 3). The primary input parameters for FIREVAT include a VCF file and a configuration JSON file, which specifies instructions on how to compute the desired filter parameters. In the preprocessing step, FIREVAT derives these parameters for each point mutation. A set of candidate solutions is generated to help the optimization process converge faster. Next, FIREVAT searches for a set of parameters that maximizes the objective function (“Evaluate”) using GA, a gradient-free approach. At each iteration, the original set of mutations is divided into refined and artifactual groups, followed by a mutational signature analysis of each group. FIREVAT further analyzes the refinement outcomes by assessing strand bias and significant differences between the refined and artifactual variant groups. Each variant is also annotated using clinical databases. FIREVAT generates output files for the following items: HTML report, optimization logs, and VCFs for refined, and artifactual variants</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13073_2019_695_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par45">To sequester somatic point mutations that exhibit latent artifactual characteristics, FIREVAT employs mutational signatures extracted by the PCAWG consortium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In particular, 18 signatures associated with sequencing artifacts are exploited: SBS27, SBS43, SBS45, SBS46, SBS47, SBS48, SBS49, SBS50, SBS51, SBS52, SBS53, SBS54, SBS55, SBS56, SBS57, SBS58, SBS59, and SBS60 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figures S5 and S6). FIREVAT utilizes a VCF file as the primary input, preferably called from a tumor and matched normal pair, and a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) configuration file that specifies how each filter parameter should be derived and treated (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Note S2). Here we define a filter as a set of numerical values that corresponds to the various quality metrics (e.g., average reference allele base quality in the tumor sample) either reported by the caller or computed by the user for each variant.</p>
      <p id="Par46">Next, somatic point mutations are selected and each desired filter parameter is obtained for each mutation. A preliminary mutational signature analysis is conducted to determine if variant refinement is necessary based on the weights of the artifact signatures. Each filter parameter is independently traversed while dividing the set of given mutations into putative refined and artifactual mutations. This process results in a set of candidate solutions that is later used to expedite convergence in the FIREVAT variant refinement optimization stage.</p>
      <p id="Par47">The FIREVAT objective function aims to maximize cosine similarity score of the resulting signature analysis, minimize the summed weights of the artifact signatures in the set of refined mutations, and thereby enrich the contribution of artifact signatures in the low-quality artifactual mutations. Hence, maximization of the FIREVAT objective function is an abstraction of the multiobjective optimization problem that yields Pareto optimal values of the four aforementioned criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Various information supporting each variant, such as quality scores and read depths computed by variant calling software, constitutes the FIREVAT algorithm search space, which is explored using a genetic algorithm (GA), a gradient-free approach.</p>
      <p id="Par48">After the most optimized parameters are determined, FIREVAT performs strand bias analysis, analyzes the statistical significance of each parameter, and annotates each variant using clinical variant databases such as ClinVar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and COSMIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Filtered mutations in clinically actionable genes can be rescued at the final stage. FIREVAT outputs VCF files of high-quality refined variants and low-quality artifactual variants and provides a thorough report of the refinement processes and results. These results are presented to the user in the form of an HTML file, which includes intuitive publication-ready figures and tables. FIREVAT also supports multiprocessing on each VCF file and enables a scalable computation of multiple samples on demand.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec4">
      <title>Inputs</title>
      <p id="Par49">FIREVAT utilizes a VCF file as the primary input as well as a JSON configuration file detailing instructions on how to extract desired filter parameters. FIREVAT uses the bedr R software package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] to read the input VCF file. The genomic assembly of the VCF file is processed using the BSgenome R software package. The FIREVAT R software package already includes default configuration files for some of the widely used variant callers. Users are also able to generate custom configuration files on demand. Another important input is the reference mutational signature matrix. The COSMIC mutational signature version 3 matrix is included in the package as FIREVAT requires this a priori information to operate its variant refinement function. Alternatively, users can supply their own matrix provided that signatures with artifactual characteristics are included.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec5">
      <title>Preprocessing</title>
      <p id="Par50">FIREVAT first selects point mutations in the user-supplied VCF file. To execute mutational signature analysis, FIREVAT prematurely terminates if the number of point mutations does not satisfy the minimum requirement of 50 point mutations. A preliminary signature analysis is performed to assess whether refinement is necessary. FIREVAT deems a given set of mutations refined if the initial sum of artifact signature weights, obtained from unrefined mutations, is lower than the minimum threshold (default = 0.05). Next, each of the desired filter parameters in the input configuration JSON file is computed for each point mutation.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec6">
      <title>Candidate solution generation</title>
      <p id="Par51">To create benchmark objective values that help the GA optimization converge faster, FIREVAT generates a set of candidate solutions. Each candidate solution is a vector of cutoff values for quality-related attributes for the variants called (e.g., variant allele fraction ≥ 5% and tumor reference allele read depth ≥ 10). Each filter parameter is then traversed from the minimum to the maximum value observed in the input VCF file. At each increment, FIREVAT divides the set of point mutations into refined and artifactual groups depending on each filtering criterion. Subsequently, signature analysis is conducted for both groups to derive the objective value (see the “Variant refinement optimization” section below). Parameter values that yield nonzero objective values are passed to the GA optimization stage as potential solutions.</p>

For the evaluation of post FIREVAT signature analysis, we used the following TCGA datasets (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S1): head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. For the characterization of artifactual signatures, we used the TCGA-HNSC, TCGA-BRCA, TCGA-PAAD, and TCGA-STAD datasets as well as five additional TCGA datasets: glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], acute myeloid leukemia (LAML) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. We used R version 3.5.1 to run FIREVAT v0.4.2 on these datasets (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Method S2 and Method S3).

      <title>Performance validation (multi-center mutation calling in multiple cancers (MC3)) dataset</title>
      <p id="Par67">We downloaded the Multi-Center Mutation Calling in Multiple Cancers (MC3) dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) GDC data portal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. To define ground truth data, we used the “mc3.v0.2.9.CONTROLLED_lt3_b.maf” file. At the outset, we retained point mutations in this Mutation Annotation Format file. Next, we selected samples that had WES, WGS, and RNA-seq mutation validation status information. We further selected samples that had only one matching normal sample. To establish ground truth, we herein describe how we determined real somatic and artifactual mutations in the MC3 dataset. To identify real somatic mutations, we first selected variants that were captured in the targeted exonic region. We further selected variants that were validated and statistically powered in either WGS or targeted sequencing in terms of read evidence according to the MC3 definition (“mutval_targeted_status” = “validated_powered” or “mutval_wgs_status” = “validated_powered”). Among these variants, we finally selected variants that were also validated and statistically powered in WES (“mutval_wex_status” = “validated_powered”). To identify artifactual variants, we first selected variants that did not satisfy the requirements for classification of real somatic mutations. Then, we screened for variants that were unvalidated and statistically unpowered in WGS (“mutval_wgs_status” = “unvalidated_unpowered”), labeling these as artifactual mutations. We used 774 VCF files from 360 samples that had more than 500 real somatic or artifactual mutations as part of our variant refinement performance validation study (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Note S3). We also selected 28 samples that had less than 500 real somatic or artifactual mutations and used these to benchmark the performance of various objective functions and FIREVAT input parameters.</p>
      <p id="Par68">The MC3 dataset includes a number of different callsets for each sample. We used the MuTect, Muse, SomaticSniper, and Varscan hg19 callsets in our FIREVAT refinement validation study. Of these, we excluded the SomaticSniper callset because our preliminary analysis on several SomaticSniper VCF files yielded initial sum of artifact signature weights lower than the minimum threshold, indicating that mutational signature-based FIREVAT refinement may not be necessary. For the remaining MuTect, Muse, and Varscan callsets, we ran FIREVAT v0.4.2 using their respective configuration files (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2). We evaluated FIREVAT variant refinement performance using the ground truth data. To compare FIREVAT refinement performance, we applied three other manual hard-filtering approaches on the same MC3 validation samples. These approaches were suggested by variant caller developing groups: Lancet filter (LAN-F) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], MuTect filter (MUT-F) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], and Varscan filter (VAR-F) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Method S2). Subsequently, for each filtering method, we analyzed the performance evaluation metrics (precision, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and accuracy) against the sum of signature artifact weights. We also used the PCAWG Platinum mutational signatures for benchmarking purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p>

      <p id="Par70">To evaluate the FIREVAT variant refinement performance on the multi-region WES breast cancer samples, we downloaded the supplementary tables from the original manuscript for technical and biological replicates.

      <title>Evaluation of FIREVAT variant refinement performance on real-world datasets</title>
      <p id="Par77">We evaluated the validity and reliability of FIREVAT variant refinement using two publicly available real-world datasets comprising 384 total samples (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Note S3).</p>
      <p id="Par78">The first dataset was the MC3 dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], which consists of mutation calls in VCF file format from multiple callers for over 11,000 tumor samples (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3). Because confidence in the detection of somatic mutations can be ascertained by additional sequencing methods (e.g., WES, WGS, and/or RNA-seq), we can determine whether a variant is a clonal true positive. We used the MuTect, Muse, and Varscan MC3 callsets comprising 774 VCF files from 360 samples. The MuTect callset included 191,118 (93.86%) clonal true positives (real somatic mutations) and 12,511 (6.14%) false positives (artifactual mutations). In the Muse callset, 207,784 (82.17%) real somatic mutations and 45,091 (17.83%) artifactual mutations were present. The Varscan callset had the highest number and proportion of artifactual mutations, including 117,803 (60.73%) real somatic mutations and 76,179 (39.27%) artifactual mutations. In total, 516,705 (79.43%) real somatic mutations and 133,781 (20.57%) artifactual mutations were utilized. We used five metrics to evaluate FIREVAT performance: precision, sensitivity, F1 score (harmonic mean of the precision and sensitivity), specificity, and accuracy (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Method S2). We compared the variant refinement performance of FIREVAT on the MC3 samples against three other filtering methods (LAN-F, MUT-F, and VAR-F; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Method S2). Each filtering approach was independently applied on each of the three MC3 callsets.</p>
      <p id="Par79">FIREVAT performed at the highest level for four of the five metrics compared with the three widely adopted manual filtering approaches when evaluated on all mutations called by MuTect, Muse, and Varscan (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a): precision (median = 0.958), F1 score (median = 0.933), specificity (median = 0.678), and accuracy (median = 0.908) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Tables S4 and S5).

      <p id="Par80">We additionally compared the FIREVAT performance in each callset. Using the mutations called by MuTect, FIREVAT yielded the highest level of precision and specificity with median values of 0.978 and 0.250, respectively, while achieving a sensitivity comparable to those of the other filtering approaches. While the MUT-F and VAR-F methods yielded higher median F1 scores (MUT-F = 0.972, VAR-F = 0.966) than FIREVAT (median = 0.964), these methods performed poorly in terms of specificity (MUT-F = 0.067, VAR-F = 0.000).</p>
      <p id="Par81">In the Muse callset, FIREVAT yielded the highest F1 score with a median of 0.932. Similar to the performance observed in the MuTect callset, the median sensitivities of the MUT-F (0.996) and VAR-F (0.982) methods were higher than that of FIREVAT (0.973), but the median specificities were lower (MUT-F = 0.010, VAR-F = 0.031, FIREVAT = 0.601). The LAN-F method resulted in the highest specificity (0.667) in the Muse callset but had a lower sensitivity (0.927) than FIREVAT (0.973).</p>
      <p id="Par82">The FIREVAT refinement results of the MC3 Varscan callset yielded the highest specificity with a median of 0.941, filtering out 88.9% of the original variants on average. In contrast, 23.4% and 10.8% mutations were filtered out in the Muse and MuTect callsets. The MUT-F and VAR-F methods achieved higher median sensitivities (MUT-F = 0.996, VAR-F = 0.972) than FIREVAT (0.842). However, the FIREVAT median specificity was dramatically higher than those of the other methods (MUT-F = 0.034, VAR-F = 0.043, FIREVAT = 0.941).</p>
      <p id="Par83">The proportion of filtered variants was positively correlated to the filtering stringency identified by FIREVAT on each callset. For example, the median cutoff for the minimum number of altered reads in the tumor sample was 3 for the MuTect callset and 8 for the Varscan callset (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figures S8–S10). The need for stricter filtering parameters determined by FIREVAT was consistent with a previously published benchmark study that reported that Varscan variant caller has the highest false positive rate among the widely used variant callers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Next, we assessed the characteristics of samples that resulted in low refinement performance. We observed that the specificity was positively correlated (Pearson correlation <italic>r</italic> = 0.62) with the initial sum of sequencing artifact weights (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b) when considering all mutations from all three callers (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figures S11–S17).</p>
      <p id="Par84">The second dataset utilized for evaluation of FIREVAT variant refinement performance was the multi-region WES dataset, where breast cancer samples were sequenced multiple times by biological and technical replicates. To evaluate whether variant refinement can successfully shortlist the true positive mutations validated by targeted sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], we benchmarked FIREVAT with DToxoG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. We compared our objective functions to DToxoG for benchmarking purposes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). We found that FIREVAT consistently yielded the highest median precision level (0.736 for Default.Obj.Fn) compared to DToxoG (precision = 0.533) for the different objective functions used (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S6). FIREVAT refinement of the 6 pairs of technical replicates resulted in increased proportion of validated variants among the total number of variants (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S18). We also applied FIREVAT to the 18 biological replicate data from the 6 breast cancer cases, for which the presence of intratumoral heterogeneity was also validated with targeted sequencing (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S19, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The increase in precision resulting from FIREVAT refinement was also observed in the ICGC-TCGA-DREAM Somatic Mutation Calling Challenge dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] and in additional benchmarking studies. We also found that refinement outcomes are more accurate when FIREVAT is applied with built-in filters in variant calling software (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Note S4).</p>

      <title>FIREVAT leads to enrichment of biologically relevant signatures</title>
      <p id="Par85">To further investigate the FIREVAT refinement performance, we applied FIREVAT to public calls from 130 TCGA-HNSC (head and neck cancer) VCF files from the NCI GDC data portal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S20, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S8). We decomposed the mutational spectrums using the 65 COSMIC mutational signatures (version 3). All samples had a cosine similarity score of 0.9 or higher in the decomposition of mutational signatures. However, a substantial fraction of mutations was attributed to sequencing error signatures such as SBS45 (median weight = 28.4%), SBS43 (median weight = 14.9%), and SBS50 (median weight = 14.7%) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). We refined the raw callsets using FIREVAT. FIREVAT completed the mutation refinement process in approximately 475 min (with 208 central processing units (CPUs), a GA maximum iteration = 100, and a GA population size = 200), filtering out 81.5% of the mutation calls on average (min = 49.3%, max = 98.8%, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S8). Overall, the refined callsets led to a substantially higher fraction of biologically relevant mutational signatures. The linear correlation between the amount of lifetime tobacco smoking (in pack-years at the time of diagnosis) and the mutational burden of tobacco smoking-related signatures (SBS4 and SBS29) increased (from 0.094 to 0.230) after the FIREVAT refinement process (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S20D). In the case of TCGA-CR-7399, 5084 (88.59%) out of 5739 somatic mutation calls were labeled as artifacts by FIREVAT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The C&gt;A peaks that were apparent in the unrefined mutations of this sample exhibited a high weight of SBS45 (60.6%), the spectrum of which is known to be associated with 8-oxoG artifacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The 8-oxoG contamination was mostly attenuated (from 60.6 to 0.0%; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c) after FIREVAT refinement and other biologically relevant mutational signatures reciprocally emerged, for example the tobacco smoking signature SBS4 (from 0.0 to 47.6%) and the APOBEC-mediated signatures SBS2 (from 1.1 to 6.1%) and SBS13 (from 0.0 to 4.6%). Of note, this head and neck cancer patient had smoked 135 pack-years at the time of diagnosis.

      <p id="Par86">Moreover, we applied the FIREVAT refinement process to mutation calls from 79 TCGA samples with platinum therapy response data: 10 BRCA samples, 10 PAAD samples, and 59 STAD samples (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S21, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S9). In one STAD WGS sample (TCGA-FP-8211), the homologous recombination (HR) deficiency signature (SBS3) emerged only in the FIREVAT-refined callset and was masked by an artifact signature (SBS60) in the original unrefined callset (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S22). As previously suggested, the HR-deficiency signature mutational signature is a predictive marker of platinum therapy response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Intriguingly, the patient showed a complete response to platinum therapy (oxaliplatin).</p>
      <p id="Par87">Using 9 TCGA cohorts and the multi-region WES dataset (signature analysis dataset and consistency validation dataset, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Note S3), we further found that error-mediated signatures are widespread in publicly available VCF files (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S23). The sum of artifact signature weights varied by cancer study. For example, the median sums of artifact signature weights were 68.6% and 6.6% for acute myeloid leukemia (TCGA-LAML) and TCGA-BRCA, respectively (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S10). The signature SBS43 was the most recurrently observed among artifactual variants across the studies that had 20 or more samples, with lung adenocarcinoma (TCGA-LUAD) having the highest median weight of 22%. Certain artifact signatures were enriched in specific studies. For example, TCGA-HNSC samples had a median weight of 28.4% in SBS45, and TCGA-LAML samples had median weights of 37.4% and 37.8% in SBS27 and SBS47, respectively. Furthermore, the study-specific enrichment of artifact signatures was also observed in sequence contexts. For example, in the TCGA-LAML cohort, the artifactual mutations favored regions of repeated adenine sequences (3 bases upstream and 7 bases downstream). In the TCGA-LUAD and TCGA-STAD cohorts, guanine was redundantly found at the first and fifth bases upstream of the variant position. These cohorts shared relatively high median weights of SBS43, suggesting that the sequence context is reflective of this artifact signature. In the multi-region WES dataset (SRP070662), SBS51 was detected in 20 (83.3%) out of 24 samples with a median weight of 21.1%, while the first base immediately upstream or downstream of the variant position was commonly guanine.

The bar color intensity (white to red) represents the median weight of the observed artifactual signature and the bar length represents the number of samples that had the corresponding signature as the most heavily weighted artifactual signature. The artifactual signatures with a median weight higher than 0.2 are highlighted in bold font. The second plot shows the distribution of artifactual signatures among the original (green: Ori), refined (blue: Ref), and artifactual (orange: Art) sets of mutations, respectively. The last plot shows the enrichment of sequence motifs in the artifactual variants 10 bases upstream and downstream of each variant position</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13073_2019_695_Fig4_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par88">Furthermore, we investigated and summarized the currently known artifact signatures that FIREVAT effectively removes via its refinement. In short, there are four types of artifacts that FIREVAT accurately identifies and filters out: (1) 8-oxoG artifacts (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>), (2) FFPE-specific artifacts (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>), (3) germline contamination (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>), and (4) Thymine to Guanine transversion artifacts in Guanine-rich context (i.e., G [T&gt;G] G substitution) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Detailed analysis on each type of artifact found that these artifact signatures are associated with variants supported by low base quality scores and by a lack of alternate allele read evidence (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Note S5).

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par89">FIREVAT is the first publicly available software toolkit that performs variant refinement guided by mutational signatures. This software is easy to install and is implemented as an R package. We have herein shown the high performance of our novel variant refinement approach. Our software only requires VCF files and simplifies existing variant refinement processes, which often require the computationally expensive interrogation of BAM files [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] and manual inspection of candidate variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Such inspection also necessitates well-trained bioinformaticians. In contrast, FIREVAT automates variant refinement using single nucleotide substitution profiles of sequencing artifacts. In addition, we have shown that sequencing artifacts incorporated in mutational patterns have distinct contexts and can be correctly distinguished. FIREVAT effectively reduces the number of false positives in user-supplied VCF files and renders comprehensive reports that detail the refinement processes and outcomes.</p>
    <p id="Par90">Post-processing of variant calling is an indispensable step in the conventional cancer genomics analysis pipeline that ensures retention of high-quality real somatic variants and removal of artifactual variants. Inclusion of artifactual variants in downstream analysis leads to clinical errors and misinformed discovery of novel biological findings in research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Variant calling by multiple callers and a series of filtering tasks have shown high levels of sensitivity and specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. However, the massive computational resources required to operate such tasks are burdensome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Here we have demonstrated the high performance of FIREVAT on three independent real-world datasets with 678 tumor samples. We have shown that mutational signatures can be used to strategically remove artifactual variants. FIREVAT successfully achieves this task while taking advantage of sequencing artifact patterns observed in over 23,000 samples, namely the COSMIC mutational signatures (version 3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par91">Mutational signature analysis lends biologically and clinically relevant etiologies and concisely captures mutations observed in cancer genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. For this reason, this technique is widely used in cancer research. Based on this comprehensibility, the FIREVAT evaluation method can also be used as a proxy for data quality control in various steps of conventional cancer genomics pipelines, ranging from initial variant calling to variant refinement. FIREVAT will have broad applicability in future research studies that rely on accurate mutational signature analysis. FIREVAT is also able to handle custom matrices of mutational signatures. This allows versatile identification of diverse mutational patterns, including platform-specific artifact signatures previously unreported before. FIREVAT can be used to evaluate whether a particular sample should be included in downstream analysis based on the sum of sequencing artifact signature weights. The samples that were found to have certain sequencing artifact signatures were indeed blacklisted for having poor sequencing data quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. FIREVAT will be of great utility for cancer biologists, bioinformaticians, and clinicians because it can run conveniently on a personal laptop with limited resources and streamline the multitude of computational tasks popularly performed today. With FIREVAT, a quick quality assessment of variants identified from sequencing data is possible.</p>
    <p id="Par92">Furthermore, accurate signature analysis is implicated in potential predictions of therapeutic responses in cancer. For instance, the signature related to HR deficiency is known to predict the responses of breast and pancreatic cancer patients to platinum therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. The APOBEC-mediated signature is also known to predict the responses of NSCLC patients to immunotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. FIREVAT accurately separates biological signals and technical noise by identifying enriched peaks reflective of sequencing artifacts, effectively discriminating variants while optimizing filtering cutoff parameters. Our validation study on the MC3 dataset showed that FIREVAT dynamically adjusts the filtering stringency based on the prevalence of artifactual mutations. In addition, the HNSC samples as well as the STAD sample whose mutational patterns were dramatically altered before and after FIREVAT refinement exemplify the clinical utility of our software toolkit.</p>
    <p id="Par93">In addition, we have shown that the sequencing artifacts incorporated in mutational patterns have distinct contexts and can be correctly isolated. FIREVAT uses this novel analytical method to effectively reduce the number of false positives in user-supplied VCF files and renders comprehensible reports that detail the refinement processes and outcomes. Of note, the mutational signature-based variant refinement strategy implemented in FIREVAT can be more broadly applied as a signature extraction tool. For example, our FIREVAT approach can be used to identify ranges of VAF that are enriched in biologically and clinically important signatures such as SBS2, SBS3, SBS4, and SBS13 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Note S6).</p>
    <p id="Par94">Existing variant filtering approaches often require a computationally expensive interrogation of BAM files and manual inspection of candidate variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In contrast, FIREVAT automates the post hoc variant refinement process using the 96 single nucleotide substitution profiles of sequencing artifacts while optimizing cutoff parameters for each tumor sample.</p>
    <p id="Par95">To use FIREVAT, some prerequisite conditions should be met. For example, accurate deconvolution of the aggregated characteristics of mutation calls requires a sufficient number of mutations from a VCF file [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Second, sufficient supporting evidence on each mutation should be provided for accurate variant refinement. For instance, as previously reported, the variant allele fraction is one of the most important features for accurate variant refinement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In the MC3 validation study using the Varscan callset, FIREVAT imposed more stringent filtering parameters and resulted in a higher percentage of filtered mutations than the originally identified sum of artifact signature weights. Third, a subset of the latest COSMIC mutational signatures, such as SBS12 and SBS46, have similar punctuated trinucleotide substitution peaks and exemplify challenges in signature analysis. This problem may be aggravated by a smaller number of mutations, such as those obtained from targeted sequencing. Recently, the development of a mutational signature analysis toolkit that leverages machine learning has managed to resolve this issue for the HR-deficiency signature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Similar approaches can be applied to the task of mutational signature guided variant refinement to further improve differentiation between signatures.</p>
    <p id="Par96">Going forward, as mutational signatures become more exhaustive and sensitive to biological, clinical, and experimental patterns in cancer mutations, we anticipate that the FIREVAT performance will concurrently improve its performance. In this light, FIREVAT lays the foundation for variant refinement based on mutational signatures and the approaches described herein suggest the feasibility of a persistent evaluation method for variant refinement. Going forward, the FIREVAT approach can be similarly applied to small insertions and deletions (indels) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], copy number alterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], and structural variations if sufficient evidence of the effects of sequencing artifacts can be profiled at these genomic levels.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p id="Par97">In conclusion, we have developed a publicly available software toolkit that efficiently removes artifactual variants in cancer samples using mutational signatures. We have shown that mutational signatures can be used as a variant refinement strategy. Our novel FIREVAT approach, which we have validated to perform highly on 384 tumor samples, should hereafter be widely used. FIREVAT secures reliability in refining mutations called from widely used variant callers and outperforms existing manual filtering methods while addressing the issue of arbitrarily determined hard-filtering parameters. The FIREVAT refinement process is streamlined for users with the call of a single function using VCF files, and presents a conveniently accessible quality control report to the user.</p>
