      <title>ABSTRACT</title>
      <p>PIWI interacting RNAs (piRNAs) have emerged as important gene regulators in recent times. Since the release of our first version of piRNAQuest in 2014, lots of novel piRNAs have been annotated in different species other than human, mouse and rat. Such new developments in piRNA research have led us to develop an updated database piRNAQuest V.2. It consists of 92,77,689 piRNA entries for 25 new species of different phylum along with human, mouse and rat. Besides providing primary piRNA features which include their genomic location, with further information on piRNAs overlapping with repeat elements, pseudogenes and syntenic regions, etc., the novel features of this version includes (i) density based cluster prediction, (ii) piRNA expression profile across various healthy and disease systems and (iii) piRNA target prediction. The concept of density-based piRNA cluster identification is robust as it does not consider parametric distribution in its model. The piRNA expression profile for 21 disease systems including cancer have been hosted in addition to 32 tissue specific piRNA expression profile for various species. Further, the piRNA target prediction section includes both predicted and curated piRNA targets within eight disease systems and developmental stages of mouse testis. Further, users can visualize the piRNA-target duplex structure and the ping-pong signature pattern for all the ping-pong piRNA partners in different species. Overall, piRNAQuest V.2 is an updated user-friendly database which will serve as a useful resource to survey, search and retrieve information on piRNAs for multiple species. This freely accessible database is available at <ext-link xlink:href="http://dibresources.jcbose.ac.in/zhumur/pirnaquest2" ext-link-type="uri">http://dibresources.jcbose.ac.in/zhumur/pirnaquest2</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>PIWI interacting RNAs (piRNAs) belong to a broad group of endogenous small non-coding RNAs(ncRNAs) [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which typically ranges in length from 25 to 33 nucleotides (nts). In mammals, these ncRNAs were first reported in mouse testes [<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2–5</xref>]. They act as guide for PIWI proteins, which belongs to Argonaute protein family and exhibit slicer activity [<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6–9</xref>]. Unlike other small ncRNAs, i.e. miRNAs and siRNAs, piRNAs are biogenised from both primary processing pathway as well as the amplifying ping-pong mechanism [<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] from single stranded precursor molecules [<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] via Dicer independent pathway [<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The primary piRNAs originate from individual genomic loci that are commonly known as piRNA clusters [<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In most cases, the germline clusters generate piRNAs from both strands (known as dual-strand clusters), whereas flamenco clusters of <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic> follicle cells and murine pachytene piRNA clusters generate piRNAs from only a single DNA strand (uni-strand clusters) [<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the ping-pong cycle, generation of sense secondary piRNAs is initiated by the antisense primary piRNAs which in turn produces secondary antisense piRNAs and the amplifying loop continues [<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
    <p>Although studies on fish, flies and mammals have shown a conserved association of piRNAs with PIWI proteins [<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], the length variation of piRNAs have been observed with evolving sequencing technologies between different species. In general, piRNAs in mammals can be categorized into two subclasses called pachytene (29–33 nts) and pre-pachytene (26–28 nts) [<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], whereas piRNAs in <italic toggle="yes">Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> are named as 21 U-RNA owing to its bias for length of 21 nts. Though the piRNAs are best seen in germ cells, several studies have shown piRNA expression in brain, kidney, lung, liver, stomach, testis and ovary [<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15–18</xref>] as well as in different cancers [<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
    <p>To maintain genome integrity in germ cell lineages, highly expressed PIWI proteins in germ and stem cells [<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] take part in controlling transposon activity as a defensive mechanism [<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Studies showed that, mutation in MIWI which is a PIWI homolog in mouse leads to male infertility as well as over expression of retrotransposon transcripts [<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Similar observation has been reported in case of flies [<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In association with piRNA forming piRNA-induced silencing complexes (piRISCs), PIWI-piRNA pathway silences transposons via complementary base-pair recognition between piRNA and transposon followed by endonucleolytic cleaving of the target [<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
    <p>Existing databases like piRNABank [<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], piRBase [<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], piRNAdb [<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pirnadb.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.pirnadb.org</ext-link>], piRTarBase [<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and piRNA Cluster Database [<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] provide information on piRNAs for multiple species. Among these, piRBase is a manually curated database which hosts piRNA information on multiple species and some disease systems. ‘piRNA cluster database’ is a dedicated database for piRNA clusters where the clusters are predicted using proTRAC [<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. piRDisease V1.0 [<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] hosts piRNA records for different diseases but is not currently accessible. Despite such extensive work on piRNAs, there still remain several unexplored areas, such as their association with long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) or the presence of any genomic elements within their loci which can influence their function. We published the first version of piRNAQuest to probe deep into these lesser explored domains of piRNAome. It hosted piRNA information for three species, viz. human, rat and mouse [<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
    <p>Though various computational tools have characterized novel piRNAs [<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] but their function remains unclear. Hence, it is important to identify potential piRNA targets and disease-related piRNAs. Further, both predicted and validated piRNA targets including mRNAs and lncRNAs are not properly curated in any of the existing databases. Moreover, identifying piRNA clusters which are hotspots of piRNA biogenesis is another big challenge in piRNA research.</p>
    <p>In this work, we present piRNAQuest V.2, which is an extended version of piRNAQuest. This new version includes the following additional features: (i) extensive analysis on 25 new species in addition to human, mouse and rat of the previous version, (ii) density-based clustering approach [<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] to identify the ‘hotspots of piRNA expression’, popularly known as ‘piRNA clusters’. Since piRNA distribution varies with genomic locations in different species, identifying piRNA clusters based on their density in genome can provide new impetus to get biologically relevant clusters, (iii) tissue specific expression of piRNAs among different species, and (iv) expression of piRNAs in different disease systems with an emphasis on different types of cancers. Emerging evidences suggest that piRNAs have important roles in disease progression and diagnosis [<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34–39</xref>]. Thus, the efficacy and potential mechanism of action of a piRNA in cancer relies on its expression in various tissues and disease systems which correlate with disease progression, (v) piRNA target prediction within both mRNAs and lncRNAs that would further help to identify the key players contributing towards disease development.</p>
    <p>In addition to these extensive features, we have updated another section of the database, viz. ‘Tools’, where users will be able to predict piRNA clusters using customized parameters, check ping-pong pattern overlap in their sequences and predict piRNA targets using miRanda [<xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
    <p>Overall, piRNAQuestV.2 is a user friendly database for multi-species piRNA survey, search and retrieval. piRNA expression within normal tissues and cancer as well as the information about piRNA targets will serve as a valuable resource for piRNA researchers. The database is freely accessible at <ext-link xlink:href="http://dibresources.jcbose.ac.in/zhumur/pirnaquest2" ext-link-type="uri">http://dibresources.jcbose.ac.in/zhumur/pirnaquest2</ext-link>.</p>

Chinese hamster, Tree Shrew, <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila virilis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila erecta</italic>), as their repeat annotations were available from UCSC [<xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and this information can be visualized in graphical format from the ‘Statistics’ submenu under ‘Help Menu’ of the database.</p>

      <title>Genomic localization based distribution of piRNAs</title>
      <p>piRNAQuest V.2 hosts multispecies piRNA information where there is a remarkable increase in the number of piRNA entries compared to that in the previous version. Among the 28 species, distribution of piRNAs across different chromosomes has been mapped only for 19 species (as mentioned above) (Supplementary Figure SF1 and SF2). Interestingly, chromosome 15 in human contains the maximum number of piRNAs which is similar to our observation reported in the earlier version of piRNAquest [<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In this connection, it is important to note that chromosome 15 in human has been reported to harbour large number of low copy repeats popularly known as duplicons [<xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] which facilitate nonhomologous recombination events [<xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] that leads to genome instability [<xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Presence of maximum number of piRNAs in the same chromosome might be to overcome such adverse situation of genome instability, as piRNAs are known to play significant role towards maintaining genome integrity [<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
      <p>Further, chromosome 7 and 1 of mouse and rat respectively harbours the maximum number of piRNAs. Among the newly added species, chromosome IV of <italic toggle="yes">Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (which has also been reported earlier [<xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]) and Chromosome 2R of <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila melanogaster</italic> contains maximum number of piRNAs.</p>
      <p>Abundance of piRNAs in intergenic regions is mostly predominant as compared to that in intronic region for most of the species (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(a))</xref>. One of the significant functions of these intergenic piRNAs is their involvement in early embryonic development [<xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Further, it has been reported that intergenic regions harbour lncRNA loci [<xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Hence, we have checked for the presence of lncRNA loci overlapping with piRNA clusters which consists of intergenic piRNAs (results shown later under the section ‘piRNA clusters overlapping with lncRNAs’). On the contrary, piRNA abundance in the 3’ UTR, 5’ UTR and CDS region is less, except in zebrafish (having high piRNA abundance in CDS region) and <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> (having high piRNA abundance in 3<sup>/</sup> UTR and 5<sup>/</sup> UTR regions) (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(a))</xref>.

      <p>Further, it has been found that pseudogenes regulate its counter gene stability via small RNA mediated silencing [<xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Recently, it has been reported that pachytene piRNAs from pseudogenes directly regulate its parent genes [<xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This motivated us to check the presence of piRNAs within pseudogenes for 16 species whose pseudogene information is available [<xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. We obtained significant overlap between piRNAs and pseudogenes in several species (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(b))</xref>. Interestingly, maximum overlap of piRNAs with pseudogenes has been observed in human. Recently, pseudogene derived piRNAs have been found in mature human sperm cells which indicate their role in regulating expression of their parent gene in male germline cells [<xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p>

      <title>Distribution of piRNA within repeat regions</title>
      <p>piRNAs have been reported to have originated from the repetitive regions and they silence transposons in insects and mice [<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="cit0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="cit0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] regulating global gene expression during embryonic development [<xref rid="cit0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The piRNA loci for all the 19 species have been mapped to the genomic locations corresponding to seven major categories of repeat elements, viz. LINE, SINE, Simple repeat, DNA, Low complexity, Satellite and LTR (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(c))</xref>. Vandewege et al. [<xref rid="cit0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] reported a strong piRNA response in mammals like dog and horse. These piRNAs are harboured within the SINE repeat regions which are mostly abundant within these species. In our database, we have also reported the enrichment of SINE repeat associated piRNA loci for 12 mammalian species. In addition to this, several human, mouse and rat piRNA loci overlap with LTR repeat family. On the contrary, amphibian piRNAs show a tendency to overlap with DNA and Simple repeat family. Petersen et al. [<xref rid="cit0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] has reported the abundance of LTR repeats within those genomic loci corresponding to the transposable elements present in Diptera (a particular order of insect class). Our study also reveals similar observation in case of the order Diptera, where piRNA enriched regions corresponding to this order overlap with LTR repeat family. Presence of such repeat regions within piRNA loci can have important implications as is shown by Halbach et al. [<xref rid="cit0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Here, it has been reported that satellite repeats modulate global gene expression via piRNA-mediated gene silencing which is important for embryonic development of Aedes.</p>

      <title>Biogenesis of piRNAs – the piRNA clusters and ping-pong amplification</title>
      <p>piRNA clusters are also known as the hotspots of piRNA biogenesis. Initially, in the first version of piRNAQuest, the method described by Lau et al. [<xref rid="cit0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] was followed to identify the piRNA clusters within a chromosome. Here a fixed window length of 20 kilobases (kb) was used to identify the clusters. Later in 2016, Rosenkranz reported that the piRNA clusters are not equally distributed across the chromosomes and is not even related to the length of the chromosome [<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As the piRNA read distribution varies across the genome corresponding to different chromosomes, one should not fix the window size for detecting piRNA cluster. Hence, in this new version of our database, piRNAQuest V.2, we have adopted density based clustering approach [<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] to identify the piRNA clusters (Supplementary Figures SF3 and SF4) which was found to be effective to recognize clusters successfully in chicken germ cell [<xref rid="cit0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p>
      <p>We obtained maximum no. of clusters in chromosome 15 and chromosome IV for human (Supplementary Figure SF3) and <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> respectively (Supplementary Figure SF4). We also found the same for human previously. In <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic>, it is reported that maximum clusters lie within chromosome IV [<xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Though the function is still unknown, it has been found that among the sex determining chromosomes, ‘X’ chromosomal piRNAs mainly originate from clusters compared to the ‘Y’ chromosomal piRNAs [<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our analyses also have revealed more piRNA clusters in ‘X’ chromosomes than that in ‘Y’ chromosome of human, mouse and rat.</p>
      <p><italic toggle="yes">piRNA clusters overlapping with lncRNAs</italic>: We have studied the distribution of piRNA clusters within the lncRNA loci obtained from LncRBase V.2 [<xref rid="cit0057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. As mentioned earlier, in the first point of this result section, we observed a significant overlap of piRNA clusters with the intergenic lncRNAs (Supplementary Figure SF5A) which are transcribed from in between two gene loci. This goes in line with previous reports [<xref rid="cit0058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In addition, we looked at the overlap of piRNA clusters with repeat regions (Supplementary Figure SF5B) and found similar observation as that obtained from the distribution of piRNAs in repeat elements (as shown in <xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(c)</xref>).</p>
      <p><italic toggle="yes">Motifs within piRNA clusters</italic>: Characteristic motifs have been identified for each of the clusters. These highly conserved motifs within the piRNA clusters may provide us information on possible common piRNA binding sites within its target gene. piRNAs from a cluster generated from coding gene regions can also regulate its ‘host’ gene expression [<xref rid="cit0059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. A significant % of total piRNA clusters have been found to be overlapping with coding regions in many species (Supplementary Figure SF5C).</p>
      <p>piRNAs are also generated via secondary biogenesis or the ping-pong amplification loop. Studies on fly have shown that somatic piRNAs generally do not show ping-pong pattern, suggesting that the ping-pong loop may work mainly in germline cells [<xref rid="cit0060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="cit0061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The distribution of ping-pong piRNAs among the different chromosomes was determined. Chromosome 15 in human shows predominance for ping-pong piRNAs and has also been reported very recently by Ray and Pandey [<xref rid="cit0062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. More than 50% of the ping-pong piRNAs in human are found to overlap with protein-coding genes which indicates towards piRNA-dependent gene regulation [<xref rid="cit0063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Further, less than 10% of these piRNAs are found to overlap with repeat elements among which SINE repeat family is predominant. Previously, Das et al. [<xref rid="cit0064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] showed that ping-pong amplification does not occur in nematode, but surprisingly in our analysis, 509 ping-pong piRNAs are found in chromosome IV of <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> which may instigate the role of ping-pong loop in nematode as well.</p>

      <title>Tissue-specific expression of piRNAs</title>
      <p>Initially, piRNAs were observed to be expressed exclusively in germline cells [<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. But gradually they have been identified in somatic cells and the somatic piRNA pathway have been seen to regulate germline transpositions [<xref rid="cit0065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Hence, we have analysed 243 small RNA sequencing samples for 32 tissue types corresponding to 25 species (Supplementary File S2) in which 13 tissue types are from human. Supplementary Figure SF6 reveals the expression pattern of piRNAs among different tissue types corresponding to all these 25 species. For human, we have found the presence of maximum number of piRNAs in brain followed by colon, testis, spermatozoa which indicates the role of piRNAs not only in the germline cells, but also in other somatic cells. Previously, it was shown that there are piRNA complexes in mouse dendritic spines of brain and knockdown of those piRNAs resulted in lower spine density in the axons [<xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Recent studies also indicate that piRNAs in brain are associated in suppressing retrotransposons. This has a significant role in brain pathology [<xref rid="cit0066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. It has been found that the piRNA length distribution is related to the age of the individual belonging to a particular species, e.g. in Drosophila the length of piRNAs becomes shorter with age [<xref rid="cit0067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Further, loss of methyltranferase result in piRNA instability and reduction in piRNA length and volume, which ultimately leads to male sterility during spermatogenesis [<xref rid="cit0068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Interestingly, in our study, we have found the presence of piRNAs, which are around 36 nts in length in human sperm samples, whereas such longer piRNAs have been seen to be expressed very less in any somatic cells.</p>

      <title>Disease specific expression of piRNAs</title>
      <p>With developments in pathological research, studies have highlighted the importance of piRNAs in disease systems. piRNAs and PIWI proteins are found to be expressed abnormally in several cancer systems that increases their importance as potential novel biomarkers for therapeutic research [<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Recent evidences suggest that genomic stability of neurons may be disturbed by dysregulation of the piRNA pathways which results in various neurodegenerative disorders [<xref rid="cit0069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. As genes involved in the biogenesis of piRNAs have an essential role in spermatogenesis, mutation in those genes may lead to male infertility [<xref rid="cit0070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Besides, piRNAs are shown to regulate Th2 cell development by downregulating IL-4, thus inhibiting allergic inflammation and asthma [<xref rid="cit0071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] and have specific binding partners in synovial fibroblasts, suggesting its role in inflammatory processes like Rheumatoid Arthritis [<xref rid="cit0072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Here, we have analysed 211 samples corresponding to 21 disease types (Supplementary File S3) in which 16 types of cancer are present. The distribution of piRNAs (<xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3(a))</xref> among different cancers shows the higher contribution of piRNAs in germ cell cancers like ovarian and testicular cancer. Here, our observation goes in line with the established role of piRNAs towards maintaining germ cells [<xref rid="cit0073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].
<fig position="float" id="f0003" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>General expression profile of piRNAs in (a) different cancers and (b) other disease systems.</p></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="KRNB_A_2010960_F0003_OC" content-type="color" specific-use="web-only" position="float"/><graphic xlink:href="KRNB_A_2010960_F0003_PB" content-type="black-white" specific-use="print-only" position="float"/></alternatives></fig></p>
      <p>Among other diseases (<xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3(b))</xref>, we found the presence of 1274 piRNAs among which hsa_piRNA_425 is highly abundant and hsa_piRNA_28207 is lowly abundant as compared to the abundance of other piRNAs in Alzheimer’s disease. These have been reported previously [<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The number of piRNAs expressed in asthma and rheumatoid arthritis are 278 and 910 respectively. Another interesting observation in this dataset is regarding the length of the piRNAs. In our study, we have observed the presence of longer piRNAs in sperm sample where maximum length of piRNAs is 32 nts in case of infertile samples indicating the significance of piRNA length towards spermatogenesis [<xref rid="cit0068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].</p>
      <p>Beside the general expression profile of piRNAs in different diseases, differential expression analysis has been also performed using DESeq [<xref rid="cit0074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] to see the differential mode of regulation of piRNAs in seven cancer systems and asthenozoospermia (based on the availability of both test and control datasets). <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the number of differentially expressed piRNAs among which the expression of some piRNAs corroborated with that obtained from literature evidences.

This has also been observed in our study. The upregulated piRNAs hsa_piRNA_7806 and hsa_piRNA_31147 promote proliferation and invasiveness in colon [<xref rid="cit0076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] and renal cancer [<xref rid="cit0077"

      <title>piRNA-target gene interaction</title>
      <p>Beside piRNA mediated cleavage of transposable elements, piRNAs are also known to target mRNAs and lncRNAs and subsequently regulate their expression. The involvement of piRNAs in regulating mRNAs has been studied extensively [<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="cit0078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,<xref rid="cit0079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. In a way, similar to the slicing of mRNAs, PIWI-piRNA complex can target lncRNAs which has been observed in multiple organisms [<xref rid="cit0080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. It has been reported that a decrease in the expression levels of the target may correspond to an increase in the expression levels of the targeting piRNA, and vice versa [<xref rid="cit0081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Hence, for precise target prediction, we have screened those piRNAs and mRNAs as well as piRNAs and lncRNAs whose expression are negatively correlated. This has limited our analysis to those cancer datasets where both long and small RNA seq datasets are available. Hence, we have been able to predict piRNA-mRNA and piRNA-lncRNA interaction for 7 cancer systems (viz. lung, breast, renal, hepatocellular, ovarian, prostate and colorectal). The input dataset have been shown in Supplementary File S4 and the differential analysis was performed using the ‘New Tuxedo’ protocol [<xref rid="cit0082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Sequence based target prediction has been done using miRanda. Tissue and cell line data have been analysed separately. In order to highlight the role of piRNAs in different developmental stages, we have analysed the small RNA data corresponding to different developmental stages of mouse testis viz. 10dpp (days post-partum) and 16.5dpc (days postcoitum) as compared to that of six months old adult mouse testis. Further, piRNAs have been analysed corresponding to another disease system named asthenozoospermia where the sperm motility gets reduced in semen sample. The differentially expressed mRNAs, lncRNAs and piRNAs are mentioned in <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The final set of piRNA-mRNA and piRNA-lncRNA target pairs for 7 cancer types is shown in <xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(a,b)</xref>, respectively. <xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(c,d)</xref> shows the number of piRNA targets within mRNAs and lncRNAs respectively in two developmental stages of mouse testis.

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>There has been an increase in the number of piRNAs that have been identified in different species as well as in different cells since our first release of piRNAQuest in 2014. Initially, we developed piRNAQuest, with a goal to develop a non-redundant comprehensive catalogue of human, mouse and rat piRNAs so as to provide a better understanding regarding their genomic localization, overlaps with genomic elements and their association with other lncRNAs. Although, initial reports reveal the main functions of piRNAs to be transposon silencing [<xref rid="cit0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and maintenance of gene integrity mainly in germline cells [<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], but later it has been identified in somatic cells as well in many species [<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. All these put forward, the increasing importance of its diverse functions not only in transposon silencing but also in gene expression regulation. Hence, we have come up with this new version of piRNAQuest named as piRNAQuest V.2, where we have expanded our study to 25 new species (apart from those included in previous version) covering different phylum or classes. Along with the previous features, piRNAQuest V.2 has focused on several new aspects such as directionality of piRNA cluster, piRNA expression among normal tissues and disease systems and its targets among protein coding genes and lncRNAs. These will open up novel avenues for piRNA research.</p>
    <p>Over time, many studies have demonstrated the mechanism of primary biogenesis of piRNAs from piRNA clusters [<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Several protocols have been developed to identify them. However, lack of uniform distribution of piRNAs among the chromosomes lead us to consider the density based clustering approach to identify piRNA clusters. It will help in understanding the distribution of piRNAs throughout the genome and the formation of clusters which are the ‘hotspots’ of piRNAs for primary biogenesis. Besides, secondary biogenesis via ping-pong amplification is also important for generation of piRNAs and its role towards silencing of its target. Emphasizing on this, we checked the ping-pong overlap among the piRNAs and have also provided options to visualize the ping-pong signature within the piRNAs. In human, we have seen the presence of maximum piRNAs in chromosome 15 where the maximum number of piRNA clusters and ping-pong piRNAs are also present.</p>
    <p>In addition to this, analysing piRNA expression profile of various normal and disease systems will help us to understand the piRNA-mediated gene regulation in those systems. In this version, we have incorporated the piRNA expression profile of 21 disease systems along with several normal tissue data corresponding to different species. As piRNAs are differentially regulated between disease and normal conditions, a decrease in the expression levels of the target should correspond to an increase in the expression levels of the targeting piRNA, and vice versa. Taking this as an opportunity, to unravel the connection between piRNA expression and disease occurrence, we have predicted probable piRNA targets which may serve as promising biomarkers for early diagnosis and act as therapeutic targets for diseases like cancer. Further, in order to show the involvement of piRNAs in different developmental stages, we have predicted piRNA targets within mRNAs and lncRNAs in different developmental stages of mouse testis.</p>
    <p>Overall, the newly added features along with the existing ones will make piRNAQuest V.2 a user friendly, comprehensive database for piRNAs. Our future goal is to update the database regularly with newly annotated piRNAs along with its novel features in order to continue contributing to the growing piRNA knowledgebase.</p>

        <p>piRNA entries have been extended to 25 new species in addition to human, rat and mouse. The genome builds, availability of genome annotation and repeat annotation information and the number of piRNAs corresponding to the species has been mentioned in <bold>Supplementary Table ST1</bold>. The genome builds are updated from hg19 to hg38 and rn5.0 to rn6.0 for human and rat respectively. Data are collected in different formats like fasta, gtf and bed from the respective sources. Repeat elements and Refseq annotated 5<sup>/</sup>UTR, 3<sup>/</sup>UTR, exon, intron and CDS information have been downloaded from UCSC [<xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The miRNA information has been downloaded from miRBase 22 release. Annotated piRNA sequences were downloaded in.fasta format from National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [<xref rid="cit0083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Normal tissue and disease specific small and long RNA sequencing data has been obtained from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [<xref rid="cit0084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>].

        <title>Data processing and refinement</title>
        <p><bold><italic toggle="yes">Redundancy check and ID assignment</italic></bold>: The procedure of assigning IDs to non redundant piRNA entries is similar to that followed in piRNAQuest [<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The sequencing data were aligned to respective genome. We further filtered out those reads mapped to other ncRNAs and screened the reads predicted to be piRNAs using our in-house script. Thereafter, non-redundant reads were re-aligned with reference genome for complete alignment with no mismatches and annotated with unique piRNAQuest IDs, i.e. [three letter abbreviation of species name]_piRNA_[number]. The annotation IDs are same for human and mouse as assigned in the previous version. The only difference is in the annotation of rat from the previous one as in the last version it was not annotated as three letter abbreviation of species name. Users can find the previous IDs which are annotated in this version of the database in the ID conversion of Help menu for human, mouse and rat. To study the distribution of piRNAs within genome, we searched for the localization of piRNAs within gene, intergenic regions, intron, CDS, UTR regions, repeat elements and pseudogenes using in-house perl scripts as that followed in the first version.</p>
        <p><bold><italic toggle="yes">Density based piRNA cluster prediction</italic></bold>: Previously used cluster prediction protocol [<xref rid="cit0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] have a disadvantage of considering window size of fixed length for all species and hence does not account for the variation in read distribution among different species. To overcome this discrepancy, we have adopted density based clustering algorithm DBSCAN [<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] to develop a python based in-house protocol for identifying piRNA clusters which is based on the read distribution of piRNAs across the genome.</p>
        <p><italic toggle="yes">Clustering parameters</italic>: There are two parameters ‘Eps (or epsilon)’ and ‘MinReads’ which allow us to find candidate clusters. ‘Eps’ is defined as the distance of a read from a neighbourhood point and ‘MinReads’ are the minimum number of reads within ‘eps’ distance. To determine the clustering parameters, inter distance between the annotated piRNAs are calculated by performing k-dist analysis [<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We calculated the distance between each mapped read and its kth nearest neighbouring read which is referred to as k-dist which is plotted with respect to the its counts. Eventually, a sharp valley has been observed in this ‘count versus distance’ plot until the k-dist follows a uniform distribution. The distance, for a given value of k, after which the graphs follows an asymptotic decrease is termed as the eps i.e. eps represents the distance which repeats itself for maximum number of times and hence has the highest probability of defining the boundaries of a cluster containing at least, the ‘MinReads’ which represents the number of reads within the cluster. After the ‘Eps’ and ‘MinReads’ parameters are set for each chromosome corresponding to each species, clusters are detected from the coordinate file of the annotated piRNAs.</p>
        <p><italic toggle="yes">Cluster score</italic>: In order to calculate piRNA enrichment within each cluster, we have calculated cluster score for each piRNA clusters. This has been calculated as follows:

        <p>We also checked for the strand specificity of the clusters based on the directionality of the constituent piRNAs within that cluster. If a cluster contains both sense and antisense piRNAs, it is considered as ‘dual strand cluster’ and if it contains only sense piRNAs or antisense piRNAs, it is considered as ‘uni-strand cluster’.</p>
        <p><italic toggle="yes">Localization of piRNA clusters and characteristic motifs within them</italic>: (i) In-house perl scripts have been used to check for any overlap of piRNA clusters with coding genes or lncRNAs or the repeat regions. (ii) piRNAs show a strong tendency to form clusters in the syntenic regions of genome [<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. We have downloaded the syntenic regions from UCSC [<xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and searched for piRNA clusters in the corresponding syntenic regions among different species. (iii) MEME have been used to find the presence of any significant motifs within the piRNA clusters [<xref rid="cit0085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>].</p>
        <p><bold><italic toggle="yes">Ping-pong pattern within piRNAs</italic></bold>: The secondary mode of piRNA biogenesis, i.e ping pong amplification shows a distinct sequence based feature within the piRNAs, i.e. a 10 nt overlap is found between the antisense and sense piRNAs. An in-house python script has been developed to identify these ping-pong piRNAs and visualize this ping-pong signature pattern.</p>
        <p><bold><italic toggle="yes">piRNA profile in Normal and Disease systems</italic></bold>: We have downloaded small RNA sequencing data for different tissue types from GEO (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo</ext-link>). A total of 243 samples were analysed for 32 types of normal tissue samples for different species. Along with the normal dataset, we have analysed 211 samples corresponding to 21 types of disease data, which includes 16 different types of cancer data sets. To analyse the expression profile of piRNAs among the normal tissue and disease systems, BLAST [<xref rid="cit0086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] and in-house perl scripts were used. Further the expression level of each piRNA found in a sample was normalized by counts per million (CPM) and were further screened based on the z-score [<xref rid="cit0087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] lying between −3 and +3. Users will be able to view the expression of 200 most abundant piRNAs in each set. Additionally, we have checked the distribution of each piRNAs among all the normal tissues or disease systems which has been represented graphically to provide better understanding regarding their expression within different systems.</p>
        <p><bold><italic toggle="yes">piRNA Target prediction</italic></bold>: piRNA target pairs have been predicted between up regulated piRNAs and downregulated lncRNAs and mRNAs and vice versa. miRanda [<xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] has been used for predicting piRNA targets within lncRNAs (sequences obtained from LncRBase V.2 [<xref rid="cit0057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]) and 3<sup>/</sup> UTR region of mRNAs (sequences downloaded from UCSC [<xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]). The target score and energy threshold are 170 and −20 kcal/mol respectively [<xref rid="cit0088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. In the database, we have linked The Human Protein Atlas [<xref rid="cit0089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] and Pathway Commons [<xref rid="cit0090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] databases to the targeted genes for further pathway and pathology based analysis. Further, our database hosts several experimentally validated piRNA targets for human, mouse and <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> which have been manually curated from published reports.</p>
