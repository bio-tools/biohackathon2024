    <title>1. Introduction</title>
    <p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of thousands of genetic loci associated with complex diseases. These associations have improved our understanding of the genetic architecture of human diseases [<xref rid="B1-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, translations of these associations into biomedical or pharmaceutical applications have been limited, as the majority of the disease-associated loci reside in the non-coding regions of the genome with no obvious gene targets [<xref rid="B2-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Technology advancements in mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy have allowed GWAS to be carried out with metabolomics (mGWAS) to study genetically influenced metabotypes (GIMs) [<xref rid="B3-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. mGWAS have been very successful in identifying metabolite quantitative trait loci (mQTLs). An mQTL is a locus that is associated with variations in metabolite abundance [<xref rid="B3-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition to having larger effects compared to loci identified in GWAS of clinical phenotypes in general, many mQTLs can map to genes encoding enzymes or transporters, providing biochemical context for these variations [<xref rid="B3-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B5-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Leveraging these mQTLs to improve our knowledge of metabolism and metabolic disorders for translational applications has become a key research area in the mGWAS community.</p>
    <p>mQTLs are characterized by polygenicity and pleiotropy [<xref rid="B6-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Polygenicity means a single trait is influenced by multiple genes, whereas pleiotropy refers to the phenomenon in which genetic variants affect multiple traits or diseases [<xref rid="B8-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For instance, one single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can directly affect multiple traits, or different SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) may exist for more than one trait. Pleiotropy may provide insights into the cause of trait comorbidity and help determine the direction of causal relationships by pointing to shared genetic mechanisms [<xref rid="B8-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B10-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Various strategies have been developed to examine genetic relationships between multiple phenotypes [<xref rid="B11-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For example, LD score regression is a popular method to assess the genetic correlations of pairwise traits using GWAS summary statistics [<xref rid="B13-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Colocalization is another strategy aiming to identify causal variants at two overlapping association signals [<xref rid="B14-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These methods have successfully identified pleiotropic genomic regions and addressed fundamental research questions regarding the polygenicity of traits, but it is challenging to scale up these methods to study hundreds of traits at once.</p>
    <p>Comprehensive annotations are necessary in order to gain functional insights into SNP–metabolite associations. Many resources are available to support SNP to gene annotation, such as VEP and SNiPA [<xref rid="B19-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For metabolite annotation, there is a wealth of biochemical knowledge on enzymatic reactions as well as transporters and their substrates. In addition, mapping GWAS results to the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network can potentially augment the association signals [<xref rid="B21-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
    <p>Recently, cross-phenotype association analysis has gained increasing attention [<xref rid="B22-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It takes a specific SNP and searches for associations across a range of molecular or disease phenotypes, which allows for elucidations of complex networks between phenotypes and their genetic loci. A variety of databases currently exist to store the genotype–phenotype association datasets, including GWAS Catalog [<xref rid="B27-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], PhenoScanner [<xref rid="B28-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], OpenGWAS [<xref rid="B29-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], Open Targets Genetics [<xref rid="B30-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], PheLiGe [<xref rid="B31-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], DisGeNET [<xref rid="B32-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], as well as specific tools for mGWAS, such as the metabolomics GWAS server [<xref rid="B33-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Valuable tools currently exist to allow users to perform cross-phenotype analysis [<xref rid="B35-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, these tools do not offer extra support beyond displaying and visualization, and none of them are dedicated to mGWAS. </p>
    <p>There is a clear demand for dedicated bioinformatics resources to support mGWAS data analysis and interpretation. Our overall assumption is that by developing a centralized place for mGWAS datasets and performing deep annotation of the underlying SNPs and metabolites, users can gain valuable functional insights into the statistical associations identified from mGWAS results. </p>
    <p>A network is a valuable approach to depict mGWAS results and allows the dissection of polygenicity and pleiotropy. Heterogeneous networks comprising various types of nodes (e.g., SNPs, genes, metabolites, and diseases) and edges (e.g., statistical or biochemical associations) have been remarkably useful in depicting the complex interplay across biological entities [<xref rid="B41-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. These network-based approaches have the potential to identify and prioritize therapeutic candidates to generate new hypotheses [<xref rid="B42-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p>
    <p>Here, we introduce mGWAS-Explorer (<uri xlink:href="https://www.mgwas.ca">https://www.mgwas.ca</uri> (accessed on 1 May 2022), a user-friendly web-based platform for network-based integrative analysis and visual exploration of SNPs, genes, metabolites, and diseases. Its key features include:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Comprehensive collection and deep annotation of SNP–metabolite associations based on data from the 65 mGWAS to date.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Support for SNP-based, gene-based, and metabolite-based network generation to facilitate interpreting results.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Powerful network visual analytics system facilitating interactive exploration and built-in topological and functional enrichment analysis.</p></list-item></list></p>
    <p>mGWAS-Explorer also includes a comprehensive list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) and detailed tutorials. Together, these features comprise a powerful platform for functional interpretation and cross-phenotype association analysis of mGWAS datasets.</p>

      <title>2.1. Overview of the Curated mGWAS Datasets</title>
      <p>Since the first study in 2008 [<xref rid="B5-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], mGWAS with increasing sample sizes and various populations have been conducted, resulting in a continued increase in SNP–metabolite associations. We systematically curated the public mGWAS datasets to date. A summary table of these mGWAS datasets can be found in <xref rid="metabolites-12-00526-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Please note the <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value cutoffs are based on significance thresholds of the original studies, as the <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values and effect sizes of SNP-metabolite associations may differ across different studies due to the differences in sample sizes, population types, or the metabolomics platforms [<xref rid="B4-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B7-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. </p>

      <title>2.2. Overview of the mGWAS-Explorer</title>
      <p>The main workflow of mGWAS-Explorer is summarized in <xref rid="metabolites-12-00526-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. There are three major steps—data input, network creation, and network visual analytics. To begin, users can enter through one of the five modules based on input type. The ‘SNP’ module allows users to explore SNP–gene, SNP–metabolite, or SNP–disease networks. We provide support for LD proxy search to maximize the search by looking for SNPs in LDs with the input SNPs. After SNP to gene mapping, users can choose to include PPIs in the networks. The ‘Gene’ module maps genes to SNPs that are significant in the mGWAS datasets, or to metabolites (i.e., through encoding enzymes or transporters), or known associated diseases. The ‘Metabolite’ module maps metabolites to associated SNPs, genes, or diseases. The ‘Search’ module allows users to search known SNP–gene associations in mGWAS datasets, while the ‘Browse’ module allows users to browse individual mGWAS data in a 3D Manhattan plot or a network view. To start the analysis, users must click a circular button from the mGWAS-Explorer homepage to enter the corresponding data upload page. Various functions are available to allow users to refine the networks. In the last step, the results are shown as interactive networks for visual exploration. Users can easily search, explore, highlight, or perform functional enrichment analysis on the nodes of interest. For instance, double-clicking an edge will display the evidence supporting the relationships. The network results can be downloaded in PNG, SVG format, or as graph files.</p>

      <title>2.3. Analysis Workflow</title>
      <p>There are five modules in mGWAS-Explorer corresponding to the five different types of input. Users can upload a list of SNPs, metabolites, or genes (<xref rid="metabolites-12-00526-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a–c); browse individual mGWAS dataset in a 3D Manhattan plot (<xref rid="metabolites-12-00526-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>d); or search significant SNP-metabolite associations across all mGWAS datasets (<xref rid="metabolites-12-00526-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>e).</p>
      <sec id="sec2dot3dot1-metabolites-12-00526">
        <title>2.3.1. Search and Browse</title>
        <p>The ‘Search’ module supports searching the association results of the curated 65 mGWAS publications. Meanwhile, the ‘Browse’ module allows users to visually explore the data in a 3D Manhattan plot or network view. The 3D Manhattan plot strengthens the exploration of metabolome-wide pleiotropy at the genome-wide level [<xref rid="B39-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Users can mouse-over a dot to see the SNP annotation, including the rsID, CHR:BP, nearest gene, most severe consequence, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value, and metabolite name (<xref rid="metabolites-12-00526-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>d).</p>

        <title>2.3.2. From SNPs to Networks</title>
        <p>Network-based approaches have become increasingly applied to identify shared genetic underpinnings (i.e., pleiotropy) in GWAS, where nodes are SNPs or phenotypes (e.g., metabolites or diseases) and edges represent significant associations [<xref rid="B11-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The ‘SNPs’ module supports SNP–metabolite (or metabolite ratios), and SNP–disease network analysis. Optionally, LD proxy search (i.e., population type and r<sup>2</sup>) could be performed to maximize the results. Users also have the flexibility to include PPI networks, as well as to filter on biofluid or population types (<xref rid="metabolites-12-00526-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a).</p>

        <p>For many GIMs, metabolites can be functionally connected to enzymes, or transporters [<xref rid="B3-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The ‘Metabolites’ module allows users to perform either statistical-based or knowledge-based metabolite-gene associations as well as metabolite-disease associations. Users can upload a list of metabolites from the upload page (<xref rid="metabolites-12-00526-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>b). mGWAS-Explorer currently accepts either HMDB ID, KEGG ID or compound name.

        <p>The host genetic variation is known to influence the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref rid="B45-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and the blood metabolomics can reveal biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis [<xref rid="B50-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. However, understanding mechanisms that link genetic variation to metabolism and clinical endpoints remains an important challenge. Therefore, we applied mGWAS-Explorer to a list of SNPs identified from a GWAS of severe COVID-19 [<xref rid="B47-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] to provide insights into the shared genetic architecture of diseases and intermediate metabolic phenotypes. We used a suggestive significant association <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value threshold (1 × 10<sup>−5</sup>) for mGWAS-Explorer, resulting in 19 SNPs after LD clumping. mGWAS-Explorer revealed that the SNPs at the <italic toggle="yes">ABO</italic> (alpha 1-3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase and alpha 1-3-galactosyltransferase) locus were in high LD (r<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.8) with numerous other SNPs in this region associated with multiple metabolites and other human diseases, such as leucylalanine, citric acid [<xref rid="B51-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], malaria [<xref rid="B52-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], ischemic stroke [<xref rid="B53-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and venous thrombosis [<xref rid="B54-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The blood type locus <italic toggle="yes">ABO</italic> has been linked to the risk of COVID-19 in several studies [<xref rid="B47-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B55-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain the mechanism, such as anti-A and/or anti-B antibodies against corresponding antigens, or the glycosyltransferase activity [<xref rid="B56-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. mGWAS-Explorer provided insights into these possible mechanisms, which identified associations of <italic toggle="yes">ABO</italic> variants with levels and the ratios of fibrinogen A-α peptides (e.g., ADpSGEGDFXAEGGGVR) and venous thromboembolism (<xref rid="metabolites-12-00526-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>a). Fibrinogen plays a role in blood clotting [<xref rid="B57-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Therefore, the association between <italic toggle="yes">ABO</italic> variants with fibrinogen may suggest that <italic toggle="yes">ABO</italic> influences COVID-19 via regulating thrombosis, which provided a functional explanation for the observed association of <italic toggle="yes">ABO</italic> with COVID-19 risk. Indeed, studies have reported that COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism [<xref rid="B58-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Therefore, we sought to investigate whether the association between fibrinogen A-α peptide-associated loci could provide additional insights into the underlying pathophysiology of COVID-19. Interestingly, mGWAS-Explorer revealed variants in <italic toggle="yes">ENPEP</italic> (glutamyl aminopeptidase) and <italic toggle="yes">FUT2</italic> (fucosyltransferase 2) genes are associated with levels and/or ratios of fibrinogen A-α peptides. Additionally, <italic toggle="yes">FUT2</italic> gene was also identified in the PPI network with the <italic toggle="yes">ABO</italic> gene (<xref rid="metabolites-12-00526-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>a). In fact, <italic toggle="yes">ENPEP</italic> was discovered to be a candidate co-receptor for the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 [<xref rid="B59-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and individuals with an inactivating <italic toggle="yes">FUT2</italic> mutations were more likely to develop a less severe form of the COVID-19 disease [<xref rid="B60-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In summary, mGWAS-Explorer supports the evidence that <italic toggle="yes">ABO</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ENPEP</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">FUT2</italic> may be candidate genes and discovered fibrinogen A-α peptides as potential biomarkers for COVID-19 disease.</p>

        <title>2.4.2. Type 2 Diabetes Case Study</title>
        <p>Around 250 genomic regions have been associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility in genome-wide association studies, some studies have highlighted the link to metabolomic profiles [<xref rid="B7-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B61-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B62-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. We applied mGWAS-Explorer to a list of SNPs from a published GWAS of T2D [<xref rid="B63-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] in an attempt to examine shared genetic signals with circulating metabolites. Notably, mGWAS-Explorer confirmed the associations between citrulline metabolites, T2D, body mass index (<xref rid="metabolites-12-00526-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>b), and identified the missense rs17681684 variant for citrulline in the <italic toggle="yes">GLP2R</italic> (glucagon like peptide 2 receptor) gene as reported by Lotta et al. [<xref rid="B7-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Additionally, it identified shared genetic signals between T2D, coronary artery disease, and cholesterol levels at the <italic toggle="yes">ABO</italic> locus. Indeed, previous epidemiological studies have reported that the associations of <italic toggle="yes">ABO</italic> group with coronary artery diseases are mediated by cholesterol [<xref rid="B64-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], although the evidence regarding associations between <italic toggle="yes">ABO</italic> blood group with type 2 diabetes were not consistent [<xref rid="B65-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B66-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="B67-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="B68-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Thus, further studies are required to identify the associations between <italic toggle="yes">ABO</italic> variants, T2D, and cholesterol levels. Furthermore, mGWAS-Explorer also revealed metabolites levels and their ratios identified in the previous COVID-19 case study shared associations with T2D loci. In fact, multiple studies have reported the comorbidity of T2D and COVID-19 [<xref rid="B69-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="B70-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="B71-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In brief, analyzing the T2D cross-phenotype associations with metabolites and other diseases highlighted comorbid conditions with shared genetic signals, illustrating the usefulness of mGWAS-Explorer.</p>

    <title>3. Discussion</title>
    <p>Establishing meaningful connections between diseases and deciphering molecular mechanisms that underpin shared genetic architectures are among the key objectives of GWAS. Our work shows that integrating mGWAS summary statistics, LD proxy search, and visual analytics can rapidly reveal multiple associations across metabolites and diseases, which can be utilized to better understand the ongoing global health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and type 2 diabetes.</p>
    <p>When looking at the cross-phenotype associations between metabolites and diseases, it is important to investigate the shared SNPs identified in the mGWAS-Explorer output to examine where the SNPs are located on the genome and the extent of overlapping of the SNPs. In fact, we consider mGWAS-Explorer as the initial stage in a pipeline for an in-depth mechanistic understanding of mGWAS before moving on to similarity analysis [<xref rid="B26-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], colocalization analysis [<xref rid="B14-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] or Mendelian randomization studies [<xref rid="B73-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] to further investigate shared genetic signals in the same locus and to identify causal links. Ultimately, experimental studies in model organisms and human clinical studies are required to test the generated hypothesis to fully understand the mechanisms.</p>
    <p>While our first case study highlighted shared genetic variants regulating metabolite abundance (e.g., citric acid and fibrinogen A-α peptides) and COVID-19 at <italic toggle="yes">ABO</italic>, much work needs to be done to fully understand the underlying mechanisms. Citric acid acts as a bridge between carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism, promoting the growth and development of immune cells [<xref rid="B74-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Additionally, citric acid is an important component in the TCA cycle. TCA cycle metabolites play key roles in signaling regulations of the innate and adaptive immune systems [<xref rid="B75-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], which may be involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis. mGWAS-Explorer was also able to identify <italic toggle="yes">ENPEP</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">FUT2</italic> as potential candidate genes for COVID-19, although the association signal of these two genes were below the genome-wide significance threshold in the original study [<xref rid="B47-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Many follow-up studies have reported <italic toggle="yes">ABO</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ENPEP</italic> as COVID-19 risk genes; however, the evidence for the <italic toggle="yes">FUT2</italic> gene is conflicting [<xref rid="B60-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B76-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref rid="B77-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Indeed, a recent whole-genome sequencing study identified variants in <italic toggle="yes">FUT2</italic> associated with critical COVID-19 diseases [<xref rid="B45-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">FUT2</italic> is responsible for the expression of histo-blood group antigens on the mucosal surface of gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and respiratory tracts. Inactivating <italic toggle="yes">FUT2</italic> mutations lead to a non-secretor status, which confer resistance to norovirus and rotavirus gastrointestinal infections [<xref rid="B78-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,<xref rid="B79-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Furthermore, the minor allele frequency of the stop–gain variant rs601338 in the <italic toggle="yes">FUT2</italic> gene is drastically different between the European population (0.441) and the East Asian population (0.004) [<xref rid="B80-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,<xref rid="B81-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], which might explain the differences in host response to SARS-CoV-2 among different populations. However, the mechanism by which secretor status influencing COVID-19 pathogenesis is not fully understood. Therefore, it may be valuable to perform colocalization analysis and Mendelian randomization studies to identify the causal link between <italic toggle="yes">FUT2</italic> variants, fibrinogen A-α peptides, and COVID-19.</p>
    <p>Increases in throughput and decreases in cost will enable a growing number of mGWAS to be conducted in the near future. The web server will be regularly updated to incorporate the most up-to-date mGWAS datasets, disease associations, and additional SNP annotation data (e.g., eQTLs or chromatin interactions) to serve as a valuable bioinformatics platform for mGWAS researchers. With this context, we also intend to add support for peak annotations of untargeted metabolomics data obtained from high-resolution mass spectrometry.</p>

      <title>4.1. Knowledgebase Curation</title>
      <p>(a) mGWAS papers were searched from PubMed, Web of Science, bioRxiv, and medRxiv, resulting in 65 publications as of December 2021. The summary statistics were either downloaded from public databases or supplementary data of the original publications. Statistical associations between metabolites and SNPs were summarized and pre-filtered using study-specific significance thresholds. In addition to <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values and effect sizes of SNP–metabolite associations, we have included metadata from each publication, such as the type of biofluid, sample size, population type, genotyping platform, metabolomics platform, etc. (b) For SNP annotation, three options are provided, including HaploReg [<xref rid="B82-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], PhenoScanner [<xref rid="B28-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and VEP [<xref rid="B20-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] by using the Application Programming Interface (API) service of each database. For the first two options, users can also perform an LD proxy search based on different populations and r<sup>2</sup> values. With VEP, users can select either a specific distance or the nearest number of genes for SNP annotation. (c) SNP–disease and gene–disease associations were downloaded from the DisGeNET database [<xref rid="B32-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. HMDB database was used to obtain metabolite–disease associations [<xref rid="B83-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. (d) KEGG, Recon3D, and Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) were used to curate knowledge-based gene–metabolite association information [<xref rid="B84-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,<xref rid="B85-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,<xref rid="B86-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. (e) The protein–protein interaction information is based on several well-established PPI databases [<xref rid="B87-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,<xref rid="B88-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,<xref rid="B89-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>].

      <title>4.2. Input Processing and Connection Identification</title>
      <p>SNPs are identified by rsIDs, genes are identified by Entrez IDs, and metabolites are identified by HMDB IDs, platform-specific IDs, or feature tags (m/z_retention_time). Additional identifiers have also been included, such as genomic coordinates for SNPs (after lifting all SNPs to GRCh37 assembly using LiftOver [<xref rid="B90-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]), Ensemble ID, and gene symbol for genes, as well as KEGG ID and common name for metabolites.</p>
      <p>There are two general types of relationships, including inter-omics and phenotype-specific links. Inter-omics connections are based on statistical associations (based on mGWAS), or knowledge-based associations (based on positional mapping for SNP–gene annotation or encoding enzymes/transporters for metabolite–gene connections). Phenotype-specific links allow users to identify variants that are associated with disease phenotypes. This information is obtained from DisGeNET [<xref rid="B32-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] based on case-control genome-wide association studies or via text mining from the literature.</p>

Each node represents either a SNP (orange square), a metabolite (green circle), a gene (blue diamond), a disease (dark blue circle), or a seed node (yellow square outline). Each edge is either an association between one SNP and one metabolite, an association between one SNP and one disease, a positional mapping of SNP to gene, or a protein–protein interaction. The size of a node is proportional to the number of other nodes connected to it.</p>

        <p>* Metabolite number includes both targeted (compound names) and untargeted measures (feature IDs, such as ‘391.2859_3.774′ based on mass to charge ratio and retention time. The total number of such feature IDs is 2464). ** Metabolite ratios (metabolite A/metabolite B) can be useful as they may reflect the biochemical conversion of metabolites and thus enhance the association signals. The # sign indicates size or total number [<xref rid="B43-metabolites-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p>
