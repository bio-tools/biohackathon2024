      <title>ABSTRACT</title>
      <p>Bacterial growth can be studied at the single cell level through time-lapse microscopy imaging. Technical advances in microscopy lead to increasing image quality, which in turn allows to visualize larger areas of growth, containing more and more cells. In this context, the use of automated computational tools becomes essential. In this paper, we present STrack, a tool that allows to track cells in time-lapse images in a fast and efficient way. We compared it to 3 recently published tracking tools on images ranging over 6 different bacterial strains with various morphologies. STrack showed to be the most consistent tracking tool, returning more than 80% of correct cell lineages on average, in comparison to manually annotated ground-truth. The python implementation of STrack, a docker structure, and a tutorial on how to download and use the tool can be found on the following github page: <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/Helena-todd/STrack" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/Helena-todd/STrack</ext-link>.</p>
      <p><bold>IMPORTANCE</bold> Automated image analysis of growing prokaryotic cell populations becomes indispensable with larger data sets, such as derived by time-lapse microscopy. The tracking of the same individual cells and their daughter lineages is cumbersome and prone to errors in image alignment or poor resolution. Here, we present a simplified but highly effective tool for non-specialists to engage in cell tracking. The tool can be downloaded and run as a contained script-structure requiring minimal user input. Run times are fast, in comparison to other equivalent tools, and outputs consist of cell tables that can be subsequently used for lineage analysis, for which we offer examples. By providing open code, training data sets, as well as simplified script execution, we aimed to facilitate wide usage and further tool development for image analysis.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Despite major advances in methodologies describing microbial systems’ states (e.g., the typical ‘o-mics’ tools), there is a fundamental aspect of microbial behavior that is escaping much of our attention. This concerns <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> cell division, phenotypic heterogeneity, cell movement, and consequently, local population growth. For most microbiome systems, individual taxa cannot be easily studied in their natural biotic context, nor followed in real-time. Most information, therefore, comes from experiments of reduced complexity, where cell growth can be followed directly by microscopy time-lapse imaging (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Time-lapse imaging provides direct information on bacterial cell shapes, sizes, and division rates, as well as more complex phenotypes, such as cell movement or stabbing, at the single cell level. It also allows us to visualize the organization of cells into colonies or spatial structures that result from food intake or from interspecific interactions. Relevant information on cell division rates (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), spatial processes (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), or interactions between bacteria (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) can be derived from the images resulting from time-lapse experiments. This requires us to identify single cells in the images, resulting in what is called “segmented masks,” and to track these masks across all time steps correctly.</p>
    <p>Several recent methods have been published to facilitate the complex task of tracking cells across time-lapse images (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Some of these tools integrate both cell segmentation and tracking in a single pipeline (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">–</xref><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Since cell segmentation often leads to errors that might have a big impact on the subsequent tracking steps, the tools typically provide a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to manually curate results before applying cell tracking. Identified cells are then linked in successive frames based on cell-to-cell distances and similarities. The tracking algorithms are error-prone, and the GUI also offers the possibility to correct tracks manually. Highly interactive methods can, thus, help to perfect tracking results through extensive curation, but they present the drawback of requiring a lot of investment from the users.</p>
    <p>Automated tracking tools that can take segmented masks as input have also been recently introduced. For example, Trackmate (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) has been used to track particles (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and can take object shapes into account when assigning tracks (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). A newer tracking method, Trac<sup>X</sup> (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), additionally considers the environment of a cell to decide which cells should be linked in successive frames. A third method, DeLTA 2.0 (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), relies on 2 neural networks to identify and track cells in an automated way. These 3 methods are automized, but they require extensive fine-tuning from the user (in the case of Trac<sup>X</sup>), specific Python scripting (e.g., DeLTA), or need to be embedded in commercial software, such as MATLAB (e.g., Trac<sup>X</sup> and SuperSegger (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)).</p>
    <p>The goal of the work presented here was to simplify automated bacterial cell tracking from time-lapse imaging. The tool we developed and tested (called STrack, for Simplified cell Tracking) is implemented in the free Python programming language and runs using one single line of code. We intentionally reduced the parameters that the user needs to define to a minimum of 2 intuitive parameters. The first one defines a restricted search space around a cell, by which the tracking algorithm finds corresponding cells in subsequent images, which drastically reduces the computational running time of STrack. The second parameter defines the division axis, which allows to improve tracking of rod-shaped bacteria specifically, by allowing them to divide only along their cell elongation axis. To facilitate the use of STrack on any operating system, we wrapped it in a docker structure (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The Docker system prevents conflicts with previously installed packages on one’s computer, and makes STrack’s results more reproducible, as it will return exactly the same results, regardless of any updates of the libraries it relies on.</p>
    <p>We first introduce and describe the underlying concept of the STrack algorithm. Then, we present the time-lapse data sets on which we applied STrack, as well as the methods that we used to assess the accuracy of different cell tracking tools. Finally, we compared STrack to 3 of the most recent automated tracking tools: TrackMate, Track<sup>X</sup>, and DeLTA 2.0 (see above), on the same image sets. To compare the tracking performance of these tools, we used expert-generated manual tracking results as ground-truth. We found that STrack on average consistently outperformed the other 3 automated methods on the 22 data sets that we used. Furthermore, we also assessed the tools’ accessibility from a user’s point of view by comparing practical features, such as their running time, free availability, and number of parameters. In the last part, we discuss STrack’s advantages and limitations.</p>

    <title>RESULTS</title>
    <p>To compare the performance of STrack to existing tracking tools, we grew 4 bacterial species in pure culture on agarose patches and imaged them using time-lapse microscopy. We limited nutrients in those patches to have a short exponential growth phase, so as to prevent cells from growing in multiple layers. In the resulting phase contrast images, cells were then manually segmented by experts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

    <p>The different species displayed differences in their growth and cell shapes, with round-shaped densely packed microcolonies (i.e., <named-content content-type="genus-species">Pseudomonas putida</named-content> and <italic toggle="yes">Rahnella</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">C</xref>), or elongated thinner microcolonies (i.e., <italic toggle="yes">Lysobacter</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas veronii</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Two additional data sets from the literature were included in this study, with further differences in growth patterns that we believed could represent a challenge for cell tracking. The first data set consisted of dividing <named-content content-type="genus-species">Streptococcus pneumoniae</named-content> (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), a coccoid bacterium that grows into long chains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>).

The induction of R-tailocin formation in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Pseudomonas protegens</named-content> cells results in cell elongation, occasionally followed by the formation of a spheroblast shortly before cell death (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p>

All tools returned excellent automated tracking results on these 2 data sets, which can be explained by the fact that the <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. protegens</named-content> cells almost did not move or divide, and by the fact that the <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pneumoniae</named-content> cells were imaged at very short time intervals, which greatly facilitated their tracking. STrack, DeLTA 2.0 and TrackMate had an average Jaccard index between 0.98 and 0.99 on the 2 literature data sets, while the Jaccard indices of Trac<sup>X</sup> were slightly lower (JI = 0.931 and 0.947).</p>
    <p>Across all data sets, the median STrack-JI was higher than that of the 3 others. STrack returned over 83% of correct tracks on average (JI = 0.838), while the second-best tool in this comparative study, Trac<sup>X</sup>, had an average Jaccard index of 0.803, and DeLTA 2.0 and TrackMate, had very similar scores of 0.699 and 0.696, respectively. We also noticed that the variance in individual JI’s of STrack was small, especially compared to TrackMate and DeLTA 2.0 which returned less than 50% of correct tracks on at least 1 data set, while STrack consistently returned over 63% of correct tracks.</p>
    <p>As an example of STrack’s stability compared to the other tracking tools, we show tracking results on 2 imaged areas of the same time-lapse of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. putida</named-content> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Although these 2 imaged areas come from the same time-lapse experiment, the performance of DeLTA 2.0 drastically changed between the 2 areas. In the first one (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), DeLTA 2.0 returned only 43% of matched tracks, with mismatches spanning all over the lineage tree. However, on the second data set (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>), DeLTA 2.0 almost perfectly matched all ground-truth tracks. One obvious difference between the 2 data sets is that one microcolony grew very close to the image border, with some cells exiting the frame (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), while the other microcolony grew at the very center of the images (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). We investigated possible links between the distance of microcolonies to image borders and tracking results, and found a positive correlation for DeLTA 2.0, whose accuracy clearly increased when microcolonies grew further away from borders (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1</xref>). TracX and TrackMate were quite consistent between the 2 imaged areas, returning tracking mismatches that spanned over the whole lineage tree, irrespective of the microcolony position relative to the image borders. STrack also returned relatively consistent results on these 2 data sets, although it performed slightly worse on the data set presented in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> (JI = 0.77) compared to the data set in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> (JI = 0.84). In both cases, the tracking errors of STrack were mostly localized at later time points down the lineage trees, when cells typically become more difficult to track as the images become crowded. TrackMate systematically performed poorer compared to the other tools, perhaps because it was optimized to track objects with complex shapes (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), whereas the objects here are all very similar in shape and size.</p>

      <p>Analysis of the effect of the microcolonies proximity to image borders on the performance of each tracking tool. The performance is represented by the Jaccard index on the y axis, with a Jaccard index closer to 1 corresponding to a higher performance. The distance of the microcolony to image border is represented on the x axis, in pixels. The association between the Jaccard index and the distance to border was tested for each tracking tool, using the Pearson’s correlation coefficient. The results of these tests are indicated in red boxes. DeLTA 2.0 was the only tool in which we found a significantly positive correlation (correlation &gt; 0 and <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value &lt; 0.05), indicating that this tool’s performance was significantly lower if the microcolonies grew too close to image borders.

    <p>Finally, we assessed the time requirement for tracking as a function of the number of cells per time-lapse. We applied the four tracking tools on data sets containing between 1156 cells and over 6000 cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> and <xref rid="tabS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). TrackMate was the most efficient tool from a computational point of view, steadily completing the tracking task in a few seconds, regardless of the data size (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). The time necessary for Trac<sup>X</sup> and STrack to complete tracking increased with the number of cells to track, but remained within 4 min for 6000 cells. DeLTA 2.0 was the least efficient of the tools we tested in terms of timing, taking between 5 min in the smallest data set to 33 min in the largest data set.</p>

    <p>Different aspects of STrack, TrackMate, Trac<sup>X</sup>, and DeLTA 2.0 that we consider valuable from a user’s point of view are summarized in <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. These concern, notably, the tool’s availability in terms of open access, user-friendliness in terms of the number of parameters to be set and necessity to rename files following a specific syntax, computation speed, and accuracy of results. All tools compared in this paper are free, except for Trac<sup>X</sup> that requires a MATLAB license. Trac<sup>X</sup> also requires specific file naming (as does DeLTA 2.0), and has 50 parameters that can be tuned, which makes it less user-friendly compared to STrack or DeLTA 2.0. TrackMate was the fastest tool we tested, and the highest overall accuracy in the tracking results was obtained with STrack.</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>Cell tracking in time-lapse images is important because it allows to gain insight in the real-time behavior of bacteria, on how cells divide, move, or express specific other characteristics (e.g., activation of mobile elements [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and induction of tailocins [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]). Identifying segmented cells and arranging them into lineages by hand or semi manually quickly becomes untractable. Furthermore, high cell numbers are needed for appropriate statistical comparison of cellular behaviors. There is, thus, a clear need for automated tools that can segment cells correctly, and rapidly group those in relevant tracks with high accuracy. In the tasks we posed ourselves here, namely, deriving cell lineages from dividing cells on surfaces into microcolonies, we found that our tool STrack outperformed 3 other recently published tracking tools. This was tested on time-lapse image series with 6 different bacterial strains, 5 of which had rod-shaped morphologies, and the 6<sup>th</sup> displaying coccoid cells in elongated chains. STrack consistently returned highly accurate results even in suboptimal images, where microcolonies grew close to image borders and eventually out of frame.</p>
    <p>STrack was meant to track segmented objects in time-lapses. The quality of segmentation, thus, plays a crucial role, as mis-segmentations, such as missed cells or merged cells, will inevitably have a deleterious impact on the tool that tries to link these cells between frames. To avoid such segmentation errors, and to generate inputs that would least influence tracking results for optimal comparison of tracking tools, we decided to segment cell contours manually in all the data sets presented in this paper. The tedious task of segmenting cells manually can, however, be replaced by automated segmentation tools (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). As a general rule, we would advise that segmented images are always visually inspected, to make sure that cells are roughly identifiable along a time-lapse series. If many cells remain unassigned, or if they were merged in large aggregates, one should consider improving the segmentation process before proceeding with cell tracking, as tracking poorly segmented cells can only lead to poor tracking results.</p>
    <p>The process of cell tracking is rarely isolated. Cell tracking can be performed to gain insight into how cells grow and divide. When coupled with fluorescence cell reporters or stains, cell tracking also allows us to derive information on how gene expression or protein aggregates are transmitted across generations, or appear in sublineages. To derive this type of information, morphological and/or fluorescence information should be computed for every single cell. The morphological/fluorescence profile of single cells can then be merged with the single cell lineage information provided by tools, such as STrack. This type of combined data could then be used to plot morphological or fluorescence information on top of cell lineages, which would allow us to identify biological relevant trends reported by the fluorescence marker.</p>
    <p>Many different tools can be used to perform cell tracking, and it can be difficult for a user to decide on tool preference. In this context, STrack can offer a reliable first solution, as it is fast and simple to use, and consistently returns accurate tracking results. For our comparison, we chose not to include interactive tools, such as FAST or Ilastik’s “Tracking with Learning” module (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), which help to achieve excellent tracking results but only after thorough training and curation with high demand of user interference. The main reason for their exclusion was the long, manual handling to achieve tracking. On the other hand, TrackMate, Trac<sup>X</sup>, and DeLTA 2.0 can be applied on segmented masks directly, and only require several parameters to be set (which is not even necessary in the case of DeLTA 2.0). To have a fair comparison, we applied all 4 methods (STrack, TrackMate, Trac<sup>X</sup>, and DeLTA 2.0) on the same data sets, with expert-annotated tracks as reference for the evaluation. Across all data sets, we found that STrack’s results were consistently closest to the manual expert annotation, but we acknowledge that some of the other tracking tools were more precise in certain cases, for example in the case of <italic toggle="yes">Rahnella</italic> microcolony growth. It might, thus, be good practice to test different tracking tools, as their performance might be data set dependent. As an example, we noticed that the effectiveness of DeLTA 2.0 was correlated with the distance of cells to image borders. Making sure to frame cells so that they grow at the center of time-lapse images, or re-training DeLTA 2.0 specifically with microcolonies that grow on image borders, might be solutions to improve its accuracy.</p>
    <p>So far, authors of tracking tools have mainly focused on tracking non-motile or low-motile bacteria, assuming that their close cell-neighbor environment is not changing drastically from one frame to the next. This is also the case of STrack, as one of its limitations is that it will link bacteria that are in close vicinity, thus making it inappropriate when bacteria start to move around. In order to tackle the much more complex challenge of tracking motile bacteria in time-lapse images, such as bacteria with a predatory behavior (i.e., <named-content content-type="genus-species">Myxococcus xanthus</named-content> or <italic toggle="yes">Lysobacter</italic> [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]), a new generation of tracking tools will be required. These tools will need to evaluate all possible cell-to-cell combinations to select the most plausible tracking scenarios at the image scale, as opposed to currently looking in the close vicinity of each cell. Alternatively, or additionally, a new generation of tracking tools will also have to consider each bacteria’s movement vector to predict plausible cell movement trajectories. This idea has recently been developed at the image scale (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), but movement vectors will need to be extracted at the single cell level if we want to reach correct tracking, even when bacteria change direction during time-lapse imaging. This will make the task of cell tracking highly computationally challenging.</p>
    <p>Analyzing images in an automated way has the advantage to improve reproducibility compared to manual data extraction. Unfortunately, even the same piece of code can still lead to variable results on different computers due to varying package versions and operating systems. STrack overcomes this issue as it is wrapped in a docker structure, in which the versions of all necessary packages are hard-coded. STrack will, thus, more easily operate across different systems, facilitating the generation of consistent results, regardless of the date or the computer on which it is launched. With reliably accurate and stable tools, such as STrack, we aim to contribute to better detection and quantification of interesting biological cell behaviors from imaging, thus facilitating our acquisition of real-time knowledge on bacterial interactions.</p>

    <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
    <sec id="s4-1">
      <title>Algorithm.</title>
      <p>We designed STrack to track segmented objects, that result from manual or automated single cell segmentation, between successive time point images. We adapted the tool to optimize tracking of rod-shaped and coccoid bacterial cells growing in planar conditions with single cell layers, such as produced in microfluidic devices (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) or surface growth chambers (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Bacterial cells typically divide by elongation, with an elongated mother cell (Time point 0) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">C</xref>) giving birth to 2 smaller daughter cells (Time point 1) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). STrack requires only 2 parameters, which relate directly to the images, to be set by the user: (i) the maximum distance (max_dist) used to look for the progeny of a mother cell (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Setting a maximum distance drastically reduces the time and memory STrack takes to run, rendering it applicable to images containing hundreds of cells. (ii) The maximum angle (max_angle) formed by a mother cell and its 2 daughter cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). This prevents STrack from allowing a mother cell to divide along an axis that is less plausible from a biological point of view. The max_angle parameter is adjustable to the species under scrutiny, and can be increased to allow the tracking of cells in which division leads to an almost perpendicular angle between the 2 daughter cells.</p>
      <fig position="float" id="fig8">
        <label>FIG 8</label>
        <caption>
          <p>STrack requires 2 user-defined parameters. The first parameter max_dist restricts the search space around a mother cell (A) to look for daughter cells (B). The second parameter max_angle limits the angle between the mother cell’s main orientation axis (C), and the division axis passing through the centers of its 2 putative daughter cells (D). If the angle between these 2 axes is smaller than the user-defined threshold, then STrack will assign tracks (represented as blue arrows) between the mother cell and its 2 daughter cells.</p>

      <p>The algorithm’s pseudocode is provided in <xref rid="textS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Text S1</xref>. It iterates over all images of a time-lapse. For every set of 2 successive time points, the algorithm will compute distances and pixel overlap between objects in the first image (we call them mother cells) and objects in the second image (daughter cells) that are in a perimeter delimited by the <italic toggle="yes">max_dist</italic> parameter. Based on the pixel overlap, the algorithm will then assign mother-daughter links (starting with the maximum pixel overlap and then decreasingly looking for cells with less overlap). For a second daughter cell to be assigned to a mother cell, the angle between the mother cell’s main axis and the division axis needs to be smaller than the user-provided <italic toggle="yes">max_angle</italic> parameter. Once all mother-daughter links have been assigned based on pixel overlap, there may remain cells with no mother cells. At this point, the algorithm will switch from pixel overlap to distances between cells to identify any potential missing tracks. It will assign mother-daughter links for increasingly larger mother-daughter cell distances (while still respecting the constraints on the maximum division angle defined above). If the distances become larger than the user-defined <italic toggle="yes">max_dist</italic> parameter, the remaining cells will be assigned to new tracks. This allows to start tracking cells that enter the image in the middle of a time-lapse.</p>

      <p>The output of STrack is a single CSV-formatted table for every time point. These tables contain tracks from mother cells to daughter cells, including their respective X and Y coordinates, thus allowing to manually verify whether tracks were correctly assigned. Two additional excel-formatted tables are exported, which contain the tracks and the cells from all combined time points, respectively. STrack also returns 1 image per time point, in which the links from the previous to the current image are shown. This facilitates visual checking of the results, as one can directly see whether tracks were correctly assigned between cells or not (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Wrongly assigned tracks can be corrected manually in 2 ways: (i) after visual inspection of the images exported by STrack for every time point, one can manually edit edges in the corresponding csv files. This solution doesn’t require any computational skills, but might be time-consuming. (ii) STrack’s results can be imported into Cytoscape (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), an open-source software for visualizing and editing networks. We provide instructions on how to edit STrack’s results in Cytoscape on the STrack github page: <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/Helena-todd/STrack" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/Helena-todd/STrack</ext-link>.</p>

          <p>Visual cell tracking validation. For each time point, STrack exports the original cell-mask-image with an overlay of the identified cell tracks. These tracks (represented as red lines) start in the center of mother cells in the image corresponding to the previous time point, and end in the center of their daughter cells in the current image. In this example, STrack identified 5 cells at time point 10, the majority of which divided between time points 10 and 11. These divisions can be seen in the image corresponding to time point 11 as red lines that originate from the centers of their mother cells in time point 10, and lead to their respective daughter cells in time point 11. In this example, STrack even managed to accurately identify the progeny of the 2 cells that were very close to the left image border in time point 11.</p>

      <title>Time-lapse imaging.</title>
      <p>Bacterial cells were grown on miniaturized nutrient agarose surfaces that allow single cells to grow into monolayer microcolonies. Such miniaturized surfaces are enclosed in a black anodized POC (Perfusion Open and Closed) chamber (H. Saur Laborbedarf), which is then mounted on a Nikon ECLIPSE Ti Series inverted microscope coupled with a Hamamatsu C11440 22CU camera and a Nikon CFI Plan Apo Lambda 100X Oil objective, at 22°C. Time-lapse imaging was controlled by a script in MicroManager Studio (v1.4.23). Phase contrast images were taken every 10 to 20 min, depending on the strains, with an exposure time of 30 ms. Cells were imaged on 8 to 10 randomly selected positions per surface, for a duration of 12 to 20 h, resulting in .tif files. We focused on 4 bacterial species isolated from soil: <named-content content-type="genus-species">Pseudomonas putida</named-content> F1 (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), <named-content content-type="genus-species">Pseudomonas veronii</named-content> 1YdBTEX2 (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), <italic toggle="yes">Lysobacter</italic> sp., and <italic toggle="yes">Rahnella</italic> sp. (the 2 latter species coming from Causevic et al. [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]). Cultures were recovered from −80°C stocks, and grown individually on nutrient agar, from which a single colony was transferred and grown in liquid media before being washed, diluted, and inoculated on the microscale-surfaces for imaging. Both pseudomonads were grown with 1 mM succinate as sole carbon substrate in type 21C minimal medium added to the agarose (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The other 2 strains were cultured with 10-fold diluted PTYG-medium (peptone, tryptone, yeast extract, and glucose), as described by Bakken and Olsen (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p>

      <title>Manual image processing.</title>
      <p>All time-lapses presented in this paper (including the 2 data sets derived from the literature) were manually analyzed to generate ground-truth segmentation and tracking results. Experts in the field of microbiology manually defined cell masks in these images using the QuPath open-source software for bioimage analysis (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). This resulted in more than a thousand segmented cells over 22 time-lapse data series. The resulting segmented cells were then manually tracked in successive images by the same experts, using the MaMut tracking Fiji plugin (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). This produced the set of manually extracted tracks that we used as ground-truth to compare to the results of automated tracking tools.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s4-4">
      <title>Automated image processing.</title>
      <p>In order to assess the computation time necessary for completion of the tracking task by the different tools presented in this paper, we re-used 5 positions of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. putida</named-content> and <italic toggle="yes">Rahnella</italic> strains, while taking into account more time points than the ones that had been manually annotated. We purposely selected time-lapses with high cell numbers in crowded images (<xref rid="tabS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). These data sets were used to assess the running times only, not the tracking quality itself. We segmented the cells in these images using the automated cell segmentation tool Omnipose (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The resulting segmented masks were given as input to STrack, Trax<sup>X</sup>, TrackMate, and DeLTA 2.0, and their computation time was measured on a mac with a i7-9750H processor, 32Go RAM DDR4 running Catalina operating system version 10.15.7.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s4-5">
      <title>Comparison of automated tracking tools.</title>
      <p>The cell masks resulting from manual cell segmentation (as described above) were used as input for STrack and the 3 other automated tracking tools that we compared it to. In addition, we included 2 publicly available image data sets from growing <named-content content-type="genus-species">Streptococcus pneumoniae</named-content> (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Pseudomonas protegens</named-content> (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). To track cell objects using TrackMate, we used a procedure from 2021 described by J. W. Pylvanainen on the ImageJ plugins website (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). We did not set any filters on the spots or the tracks, and used the following parameter values: frame-to-frame linking was set to 100 pixels, no gap closing was allowed, and track segment splitting was allowed with a corresponding maximum distance of 50 pixels. In the case of Trac<sup>X</sup>, we contacted the authors who generously shared a script with us (<xref rid="textS2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Text S2</xref>). For DeLTA 2.0, the authors shared a script on gitlab that we used to inject our manual segmentation results, and only used the tracking feature of DeLTA 2.0 (<ext-link xlink:href="https://gitlab.com/dunloplab/delta/-/issues/44" ext-link-type="uri">https://gitlab.com/dunloplab/delta/-/issues/44</ext-link>).</p>

      <p>The results of STrack, TrackMate, DeLTA 2.0, and Trac<sup>X</sup> were compared to the manually generated ground-truth cell lineages by quantifying matching and discordant tracks, using the Jaccard index (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). This index reflects the proportion of lineages that were correctly identified by a tool, among the total number of tracks present in the tool’s results and the ground-truth tracks. A Jaccard index equal to 1 would correspond to a perfect match between the tracks returned by a tool and the ground-truth. To visually compare the tracks identified by the 4 tracking tools, they were plotted as a lineage tree or as a red-line network overlaid on cell images using an in-house R script (see <xref rid="textS3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Text S3</xref>).</p>
