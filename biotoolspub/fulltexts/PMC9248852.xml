      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>We previously released the Anti-CRISPRdb database hosting anti-CRISPR proteins (Acrs)
and associated information. Since then, the number of known Acr families, types,
structures and inhibitory activities has accumulated over time, and Acr neighbors can be
used as a candidate pool for screening Acrs in further studies. Therefore, we here
updated the database to include the new available information. Our newly updated
database shows several improvements: (i) it comprises more entries and families because
it includes both Acrs reported in the most recent literatures and Acrs obtained via
performing homologous alignment; (ii) the prediction of Acr neighbors is integrated into
Anti-CRISPRdb v2.2, and users can identify novel Acrs from these candidates; and (iii)
this version includes experimental information on the inhibitory strength and stage for
Acr-Cas/Acr-CRISPR pairs, motivating the development of tools for predicting specific
inhibitory abilities. Additionally, a parameter, the rank of codon usage bias (CUBRank),
was proposed and provided in the new version, which showed a positive relationship with
predicted result from AcRanker; hence, it can be used as an indicator for proteins to be
Acrs. CUBRank can be used to estimate the possibility of genes occurring within genome
island―a hotspot hosting potential genes encoding Acrs. Based on CUBRank and
Anti-CRISPRdb, we also gave the first glimpse for the emergence of Acr genes
(<italic toggle="yes">acrs</italic>).</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Anti-CRISPR proteins (Acrs) are small proteins that can inhibit the activity of CRISPR-Cas
(clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated proteins)
systems, which were first reported by Bondy-Denomy <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> in 2013 (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). These molecules play a significant role in the
expansion of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>); thus,
Acrs can contribute to increasing the diversity of organisms, at least in the bacterial and
archaeal kingdoms. To protect MGEs against the cleavage of various adaptive CRISPR-Cas
families and types, various Acr molecules may evolve in association with MGEs, a phenomenon
that has been elucidated by the extreme sequence diversity and evolutionary variability of
Acrs. The various defensive CRISPR-Cas immune systems within prokaryotes and multiple
countermeasures of MGEs reflect the ongoing arms race between hosts and parasites in the
long evolutionary course (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p>
    <p>The theoretical prediction of Acrs at the sequence level based on little available training
data is a difficult task because of their extreme sequence variability and short sequence
length, however some sub-clusters within an Acr family display high similarity and can be
tolerant to random mutations (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Additionally,
studies show that Acrs present some distinctive features at the genome context level, such
as: (i) proteins with conserved helix-turn-helix-containing domain are typically in the
downstream of Acrs (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>); (ii) bacteria and archaea with self-targeting spacers usually harbor at least
one bona fide Acr to survive in autoimmune reactions (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7–9</xref>) and (iii) some Acr-containing phages may function cooperatively in the same
pathway (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), and their cooperation with each other
strengthens their inhibitory function and contributes to easily overcoming CRISPR-Cas
immunity (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref>). According to the genome
context, Acrs have been successfully identified based on strategies of guilt-by-association
(<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14–16</xref>)
and self-targeting search (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7–9</xref>). In addition to
discovering Acr families, the mysterious mechanism whereby Acrs shut down the activities of
their corresponding CRISPR-Cas complexes is gradually being elucidated. Acrs can exert their
inhibitory functions at different stages of CRISPR-Cas immunity, such as the prevention of
CRISPR RNA (crRNA) loading, DNA binding, target cleavage (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17–20</xref>) and reduction of spacer acquisition (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p>
    <p>In 2017, we released a comprehensive database, Anti-CRISPRdb, hosting Acrs as well as their
associated information (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), which is publicly and
freely available. After the initial release of Anti-CRISPRdb, several other resources
associated with Acrs were also proposed. To track the names of Acrs, Bondy-Denomy
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> shared a Google document (<ext-link xlink:href="https://tinyurl.com/anti-CRISPR" ext-link-type="uri">https://tinyurl.com/anti-CRISPR</ext-link>)
in Google Drive (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Zhang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>
developed CRISPRminer, a knowledge base to comprehensively collect and investigate
CRISPR-Cas systems and Acrs (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Wang
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> developed AcrHub, which integrates state-of-the-art predictors and
incorporates analytical modules (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). AcrDB is
another Acrs-associated resource that stores predicted Acr candidates based on the scanning
of approximately 19 000 prokaryotic genomes (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).
However, Anti-CRISPRdb is still one of the most widely used databases by the science
community. Anti-CRISPRdb together with these resources can serve as useful tools in Acr and
CRISPR-Cas fields. Several review articles have mentioned Anti-CRISPRdb and listed it as a
potential resource in the CRISPR-Cas field (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, Anti-CRISPRdb has been
applied for the following purposes thus far: exploring the relationship between integrative
and conjugative elements (ICEs) and Acrs (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>),
searching for potential Acr homologs (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), studying the evolution of Acr families (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), and constructing benchmark datasets to be used for
prediction (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31–33</xref>). One limitation of its application is the relatively small
number of data entries. Fortunately, the number of known Acr families, types, structures and
inhibitory activity has been accumulated over time. Due to the significant increases in data
and the application of Anti-CRISPRdb, it is necessary to update the database. Herein, we
describe an updated version of the database.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="s4">
    <title>Methods</title>
    <sec id="s4-s1">
      <title>Collection of Acrs and their structures</title>
      <p>In our previous work (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), the main source of Acrs
was literature search via the PubMed and Google Scholar websites, followed by manual
screening. Here, we added sequences with distant similarity obtained via PSI-BLAST
searches based on the following two steps: we first downloaded all prokaryotic genome
sequences from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) according to the
information recorded in NCBI; thereafter, we conducted a PSI-BLAST (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) search against each genome with an e-value below the threshold of
10e−4 with three iterations. After that, several screening steps were applied to the
initial searching results, including the screening of functional annotations and exclusion
of long sequences. In detail, the proteins with sequence length ranging from 60 to 200
were retained because Acrs present the property of short sequence length. Additionally, a
protein with exactly functional description has less possibility to perform Acr function;
we therefore excluded sequences with validated function according to NCBI annotation.</p>
      <p>To find the Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures that share homology with the Acrs, we
downloaded all protein chains derived from the PDB database
(ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/derived_data/pdb_seqres.txt.gz) and then performed a BLASTp
search between Acrs and the protein chains of PDB protein sequences. The PDB chains
showing high sequence similarity (e-value ≤1e–10, mismatch ≤1 and coverage ≥95%) with the
query Acrs were assumed to represent the corresponding chains, and the corresponding PDB
IDs were conferred to Acr entries.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s4-s2">
      <title>Collection of data on Acr inhibitory strengths and mechanisms</title>
      <p>There are two main means of quantifying the inhibitory strength of an Acr in blocking the
activity of corresponding CRISPR-Cas system, and they are <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11723" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11723</ext-link> for what is plaquing experiment
and gel electrophoresis experiments. In the former experiments, CRISPR-sensitive phages
are cultivated on bacteria harboring active CRISPR-Cas systems. In such experiments, the
suppressive strength of an Acr can be identified according to the plaquing efficiency
during dilution. This method has been widely used in previous studies (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). In gel
electrophoresis experiments, a single guide RNA (sgRNA), a potential Acr, a Cas protein
and a DNA segment targeted by the sgRNA are mixed together, and gel electrophoresis
analysis is then performed. If the added potential Acr protein can inhibit the
corresponding CRISPR-Cas system, the DNA segment will not be cleaved by Cas protein, which
will lead to slower migration in gel electrophoresis in contrast to the cleaved DNA
segment and fewer bands in the electrophoresis system. In such experiments, the inhibitory
strength of the Acr can be distinguished according to the migration speed and molar ratio
between Acr and Cas. Here, we divided the inhibitory strength of Acrs into three
categories: high, medium and low. Because previous works have estimated the inhibitory
strengths for most of the experimentally validated Acrs, we employed their strength
descriptions in our updated database. For the small part of Acrs without activity
description in references, we conferred labels to Acrs in a manually curated manner—by
observing plaquing efficiency in bar plot provided by related references, we marked low
labels to Acrs having slightly inhibitory strength compared with control group. High
labels were conferred to those Acrs showing strongly inhibitory strength, and the
remaining ones were labeled as medium.</p>
      <p>Different Acr families can exert inhibitory effects during different stages of CRISPR-Cas
immunity, such as the adaptation, expression or interference stage. Herein, we list
several inhibitory mechanisms reported in previous work: blocking CRISPR-Cas assembly,
blocking target binding, blocking target cleavage and degrading signaling molecules (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17–19</xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). A recent study from Zhang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> demonstrated that a
virus-encoding Cas4 protein from <italic toggle="yes">Sulfolobus</italic> virus shows anti-CRISPR
activity, which can suppress spacer acquisition (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Hence, a total of five suppression mechanisms have been identified to date,
which provide a wide inhibitory range for overcoming CRISPR functions at different levels.
In our updated database, we added this information by manually consulting related
papers.</p>

    <sec id="s4-s3">
      <title>Design of the Web interface</title>
      <p>The client interface of Anti-CRISPRdb was designed using HyperText Markup Language. We
designed the internal space of Anti-CRISPRdb using Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) and MySQL.
The interface frameworks were organized with Cascading Style Sheets. All the interfaces
can be suitably displayed in commonly used browsers.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s4-s4">
      <title>Calculation of the rank of codon usage bias (CUBRank)</title>
      <p>Acr-coding genes (<italic toggle="yes">acrs</italic>) tend to be located in prophages, ICEs, GIs and

      <title>Methods for estimating Acr neighbors</title>
      <p>A recent research paper demonstrated that the organization of anti-defense genes in MGEs
tends to cluster together, which can help MGEs overcome the pan-immunity of prokaryotes
more easily (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Therefore, proteins located close to a validated Acr can be considered as
the Acr candidate pool in further studies. To assess whether proteins in the vicinity of
an Acr are Acr candidates, we performed comprehensive estimations of these proteins at
three levels: using machine learning (ML)-based methods, NCBI annotation and estimation by
CUBRank. The ML-based methods referred to the state-of-the-art available programs PaCRISPR
and AcRanker and the online knowledge base AcrCatalog. PaCRISPR and AcRanker were
developed by integrating a pre-trained support vector machine-based and a random forest
(RF)-based model. Data provided by AcrCatalog are protein sequences, which were organized
by clusters, and all the data in AcrCatalog were inferred by a RF-based model. We first
obtained all six proteins whose coding genes located upstream and downstream of
<italic toggle="yes">acrs</italic>, and all the neighbors formed the candidate pool. To provide the
information estimated by Gussow <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>’s method, we downloaded the data
generated by Gussow <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)
from AcrCatalog, extracted the consensus sequences of each cluster from the downloaded
data and then performed BLASTp searches against the extracted consensus sequences to
obtain the information on comparisons between our neighbors and the extracted consensus
sequences. If the e-value of the comparison was less than or equal to 0.01 and the
compared amino acid identity was greater than or equal to 35%, we inferred that the
neighbors could be discovered in AcrCatalog. Based on the available ML methods (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), NCBI annotation and the CUBRank, we finally
provided six key pieces of information for each entry in the candidate gene pool.</p>

      <title>Construction of intergenic ORFs of virus genomes</title>
      <p>The virus genomes were downloaded from NCBI in November 2021. The virus genomes are
considered and retained if the following three conditions are simultaneously satisfied:
(i) virus genome is in a completely assembled level; (ii) virus hosts in bacteria or
archaea and (iii) the number of virus CDS is in a range of 20–50 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). These three filtering conditions made us keep 1399 virus
genomes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>,

intergenic open reading frames (ORFs) were extracted by comparing virus annotations and
all identified ORFs annotated by ORFfinder (version 0.4.3), which was downloaded at

that phage genomes have very high coding density, we therefore considered that an ORF is
in intergenic position if it has less than 3% overlapping ratio with all CDS. In this way,
we increased the number of intergenic ORFs.</p>

divided into two categories: validated and not validated. We used ‘Verified’ and
‘PLiterature’ (putative in literatures) labels to distinguish the two categories,
respectively, in which ‘Verified’ label represents experimentally validated Acrs in
literatures and ‘PLiterature’ label represents Acrs in literatures without performing
experiment, meanwhile ‘PLiterature’ also represents the Acr entries inferred by
guilt-by-association, homologous search and searching self-targeting spacers in the
corresponding references. Entries marked with putative means that such Acrs were retrieved
from prokaryotes via PSI-BLAST alignment and our filtering method.</p>

      <p>The MGE-tended and left-skewed distribution of <italic toggle="yes">acrs</italic> showed that such

      <p>We comprehensively explored this scientific issue based on our proposed CUBRank and the

      <title>The estimation of neighbors helps users mine novel Acrs</title>
      <p>A total of 13 040 unique neighbors are stored in our newly updated database, including
neighbors belonging to our putative Acrs. Among these proteins, 6923 unique proteins
showed similarities in the AcrCatalog database when we adopted an e-value less than or
equal to 0.01 and an identity higher than or equal to 35% as cutoffs. 901 unique proteins
were ranked in the top 10 according to AcRanker; 3918 unique proteins were predicted to be
Acrs by PaCRISPR (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>). A total of 2458
proteins (1679 + 313 + 105 + 361) were predicted to be potential Acrs by at least two of
the three methods, among which 313 proteins were predicted by all three predicted
algorithms; therefore, we deemed these 313 proteins to be highly trustworthy Acrs.
Approximately 86.9% (272/313) of the 313 Acrs simultaneously predicted by the three
methods were annotated as a ‘hypothetical protein’ or ‘Uncharacterized protein’ according
to NCBI annotation. The proteins of unknown function were employed to predict Acrs (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), because
if a protein has a validated functional annotation, it is less likely to perform an Acr
function.</p>

two pairs: the overlapping results of PaCRISPR vs. AcRanker accounted in the results of

      <title>Statistics of inhibitory strength and mechanisms</title>
      <p>The number of protein complex structures is increased significantly in the new version of
the database compared with the previous version. A total of 325 records in Anti-CRISPRdb
v2.2 were mapped to the PDB database via homology searches. These structures illustrated
that Acrs can suppress the activity of CRISPR-Cas systems by inhibiting DNA binding (70%),
inhibiting DNA cleavage (22%), inhibiting RNA loading (5%), inhibiting the cA4 molecule
signaling pathway and inhibiting spacer acquisition (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>), which were collected from literatures and have been experimentally
proved. Among these mechanisms, blocking DNA binding is the most common avenue among all
discovered mechanisms. Approximately 85% of Acrs were able to suppress their corresponding
CRISPR-Cas systems with high or moderate inhibiting strength (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>).</p>
      <p>These data illustrated that Acrs can block CRISPR-Cas systems with different strengths
through a wide range of mechanisms. We collected experimental information on inhibitory
strength for Acr-Cas/Acr-CRISPR pairs, and we hope that these data can motivate the
development of prediction tools for specific inhibitory abilities.</p>

      <title>CUBRank can be used to estimate the possibility of genes occurring within GIs</title>
      <p>GIs are hotspots for finding Acrs especially for those GIs in species with self-targeting
spacers. However, GIs searching programs usually have low running efficiency and are also
hard to be integrated in downstream analysis because the majority of searching programs
for GIs lack standalone versions. We investigated if CUBRank could be used to estimate the
possibility of genes occurring within GI regions. To verify this, we performed Monte Carlo
simulations based on 11 species whose genomes have well-studied island annotations (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The GIs
data of those 11 species that we used can also be obtained from reference (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In the simulation process, we first divided the
genes of each species into two gene sets: genes inside GI regions and genes outside of GI
regions. Then, we randomly selected genes from non-GI regions until the selected gene
number was equal to the gene number inside of GIs. Thereafter, we performed a CUBRank
comparison between the two datasets (genes within GIs vs. randomly selected genes from
non-GI regions), and this comparison process was repeated 10 000 times. The comparison
results showed significant differences in all 10 000 simulations of the 11 species, in
which the average CUBRank values of genes within GIs were always ranked above those of
genes in non-GI regions (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Therefore,
CUBRank can be considered as an index that is able to quantify the possibility of genes
which are located in such MGEs. This estimation for genes inside MGEs is useful to
identifying Acrs particularly for those genes in organisms with self-targeting segments
because MGEs are hotspots bearing Acrs in such species.</p>

      <title>The current Acr resources complement each other</title>
      <p>From the view of methodology, the data collections for predicted Acrs in AcrHub and AcrDB
are similar but focus on different points. AcrHub highlights the useful homologous
analysis tools for facilitating the investigation between known Acrs and potential ones;
however, AcrDB focuses on Acrs and Acr-associated operons in the form of whole-genome
scale; meanwhile, AcrDB also provides a level classification to indicate the Acr
confidence, which is a vital feature of this database. To facilitate the registration and
name tracking of Acrs, a Google document was released (<ext-link xlink:href="https://tinyurl.com/anti-CRISPR" ext-link-type="uri">https://tinyurl.com/anti-CRISPR</ext-link>), which stores a unique sequence within each
Acr family. Therefore, it provides redundant data. A recent study showed that some
sub-clusters within Acr family can be tolerant to random mutations (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), which demonstrates that the inhibitory function is maintained by
several conserved sites in such family. A single sequence cannot capture the conserved
sites of Acrs. The AcrCatalog resource comprises Acrs predicted by a RF-based model, in
which Acrs are organized as clusters. Hence, such organization allows users to study the
conserved site in potential Acrs. The CRISPRminer knowledge base collects CRISPR-Cas
annotation and also integrates Acrs. Depending on this resource, users can investigate
microbe–phage interaction, which is a useful feature to study co-evolution between microbe
and phage. Our updated Anti-CRISPRdb displays several unique features compared with the
above-mentioned resources. It focuses on the anti-defense island constituted by Acrs;
therefore, we provided estimated information for neighbor proteins to become Acrs in the
vicinity of Acrs in Anti-CRISPRdb. Meanwhile, we also integrated information on inhibitory
mechanisms, activities and inhibitory stage, which do not exist in the above resources.
<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> briefly summarizes the unique features of
these resources. Obviously, we can conclude that data in the six different resources
complement each other.</p>

      <p>Anti-CRISPRdb has promoted the development of several state-of-the-art tools for
identifying Acrs, which can tell users whether the query proteins are Acrs or not, whereas
the inhibitory strength of a potential Acr is also a key aspect that users care about.
Both of these prediction tools are powerless for the identification of inhibitory
strength. Our collection of inhibitory strength of Acr-Cas/Acr-CRISPR pairs is the primary
step for solving the issue of strength prediction.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>Herein, we describe the update of Anti-CRISPRdb to version 2.2. This version shows three
improvements compared with the first released version. (i) The most important improvement is
that we displayed feature information for six neighbors including three upstream and three
downstream of both reported and putative Acrs. These features would help users to discover
novel Acrs from these candidates; (ii) we have included the inhibitory mechanisms, stages
and inhibitory strength of Acrs and hope it would motivate the development of prediction
tools for inhibitory strength. (iii) The number of Acrs in the updated database has
increased significantly; it now includes more entries and families. Furthermore, we have
provided the features of each of the putative Acrs, which will help users to further refine
the results. Additionally, our analysis based on CUBRank and Anti-CRISPRdb demonstrates that
