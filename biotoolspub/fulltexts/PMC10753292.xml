      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Alternative splicing (AS) is a crucial mechanism for regulating gene expression and isoform diversity in eukaryotes. However, the analysis and visualization of AS events from RNA sequencing data remains challenging. Most tools require a certain level of computer literacy and the available means of visualizing AS events, such as coverage and sashimi plots, have limitations and can be misleading. To address these issues, we present <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>, an R package with an interactive Shiny interface that allows easy and efficient AS analysis and visualization at scale. A novel normalization algorithm is implemented to aggregate splicing levels within sample groups, thereby allowing group differences in splicing levels to be accurately visualized. The tool also offers downstream gene ontology enrichment analysis, highlighting ASEs belonging to functional pathways of interest. <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is optimized for speed and efficiency and introduces a new file format for coverage data storage that is more efficient than BigWig. Alignment files are processed orders of magnitude faster than other R-based AS analysis tools and on par with command-line tools. Overall, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> streamlines AS analysis, enabling reliable identification of functionally relevant AS events for further characterization. <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is a Bioconductor package and is also available on GitHub (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/alexchwong/SpliceWiz" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/alexchwong/SpliceWiz</ext-link>).</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Alternative splicing (AS) is a regulated process whereby alternate blocks of protein coding information, exons, are selectively transferred during or after transcription of messenger RNA from DNA. Introns, sequences interspersed between exons, are removed by the spliceosome at their donor (5′) and acceptor (3′) splice sites. AS arises consequent to enhanced or inhibited recognition of splice sites [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], leading to selective retention or removal of extra genetic information during or after transcription. Although AS can be complex, at its essence, there are seven basic forms [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], namely inclusion/skipping of cassette exons (skipped exons, SE), inclusion of mutually exclusive exons (MXE), alternative 5′/3′ splice site usage (A5SS/A3SS), alternative first or last exons (AFE/ALE) and intron retention (IR) (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>). These alternative splicing events (ASEs) are defined as a binary choice between ‘inclusion’ or ‘exclusion’ of the alternate exon, partial exon or intron. ASEs can be quantified using RNA sequencing reads aligned across alternate splice sites (hereafter junction reads) [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and are visualized using coverage or sashimi plots [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. AS allows a single gene to give rise to multiple messenger RNA transcripts from the same DNA template, which in turn can translate different proteins [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Additionally, retained introns can affect transcript localization and degradation, leading to altered expression [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
    <p>Despite the ready availability of RNA sequencing, including a vast volume of publicly available datasets, AS analysis is not routinely performed. Most tools for AS analysis are command-line based, hindering their accessibility to those not familiar with such interfaces. Coverage and sashimi plot visualization is limited by the lack of methods to normalize coverage at genomic regions of ASEs. If such methods existed, differential splicing between conditions could be visualized using mean normalized coverage of replicates within each condition. Individual samples from each condition with large differences in coverage can often be found even in ASEs with no significant differential splicing between conditions. Thus, the current practice of selecting ‘representative individual samples’ is flawed and leads to publication bias. Finally, data interactivity is lacking in current tools, particularly downstream to differential splicing analysis. Interactive data exploration tools would facilitate the process of identifying functionally relevant ASEs for further study.</p>
    <p>To address the above limitations, we created <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>, an AS analysis and visualization tool. <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is implemented as an R package and provides both graphical and command-line user interfaces. Starting from input bulk RNA sequencing alignment files (BAM files), <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> quantifies AS using junction reads and intronic coverage, leveraging novel junction reads to detect cryptic splice sites and exons. Differential analysis is performed using established statistical tools available in R, allowing generalized linear model (GLM) based analysis to accommodate large complex datasets. We propose a coverage normalization method to visualize IR ratios, and show that this approach accurately visualizes differential AS. A variety of interactive visualization tools are implemented, including gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, to facilitate identification of reliable candidate ASEs relevant to the observed biological phenomena. Finally, to improve computational performance we optimized storage and retrieval of sequencing coverage using a new file format, implemented alongside multi-threaded parsing of alignment files. Taken together, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is an accessible, user-friendly and computationally efficient application that streamlines AS analysis, focussing on reliably identifying functionally relevant ASEs for further characterization.</p>

      <title>The <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> pipeline</title>
      <p>We implemented <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> as an R package, with both a command-line and graphical interface, the latter implemented via <italic toggle="yes">shinyDashboard</italic>. We organized the <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> pipeline in a modular format, as follows (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>):</p>
      <fig position="float" id="f1">
        <label>Figure 1</label>
        <caption>
          <p>The SpliceWiz pipeline is organized into four modules. ‘Reference’ creates the SpliceWiz alternative splicing annotations required for processing alignments. ‘Experiment’ contains functions to process alignment files and collate their outputs into a dataset. ‘Analyse’ imports this dataset, allowing users to review quality control metrics and perform pre-test filtering of lowly-represented ASEs, and performs differential analysis to generate a table of results. ‘Display’ provides visualization tools, including volcano and scatter plots, gene ontology enrichment analysis, heatmaps and coverage plots.</p>

      <p>This design allows users with limited programming experience to use the graphical interface to run the full pipeline while enabling those with more bioinformatics experience to automate processes via the command line. Users can apply successive filters on the differential ASEs by directly selecting individual or groups of ASEs from volcano and scatter plots, and/or via gene ontology analysis. Interactively selected ASEs can then be collectively visualized using heatmaps and individually via <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz’s</italic> coverage plots.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec6">
      <title>Differential analysis</title>
      <p>We implemented a GLM-based approach to differential ASE analysis to accommodate large datasets with complex experimental designs, including time series analysis, and accounting for batch effects. Many established statistical methods using GLMs already exist for gene expression analysis, the most cited being <italic toggle="yes">limma</italic> [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], <italic toggle="yes">DESeq2</italic> [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">edgeR</italic> [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For GLM-based differential AS analysis, we implemented wrapper functions in <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> to utilize each of these statistical tools (see Methods). We also implemented a wrapper function for <italic toggle="yes">DoubleExpSeq</italic> [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], a fast statistical method in R for differential AS analysis using simple contrasts between two conditions (see Methods).</p>
      <p>To assess the accuracy of these algorithms at identifying differential ASEs, we simulated reads to emulate transcript expression and technical parameters derived from a real RNA-seq dataset (THP-1 monocyte to macrophage differentiation [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]) using RSEM [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We used the percent-spliced-in (PSI) metric to quantify AS, which is determined based on known transcript expression values (see Methods). From these PSI values, a set of ground truth differential events were defined by modelling PSIs using a beta distribution (see Supplementary Methods). Accuracy was measured using two parameters: (i) to assess a method’s ability to accurately detect and appropriately rank the full set of differential events, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values were calculated for each method. (ii) To assess precision of the top ranked events in the analysis, we calculated the proportion of ground truth events that overlap with the top K predicted differential events, where K is the number of ground truth differential events in the simulation (hereafter Top-K accuracy).</p>
      <p>We first compared the performance of each statistical wrapper implemented in <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> (<xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We found that <italic toggle="yes">DESeq2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">edgeR</italic> were the top performers, with <italic toggle="yes">DESeq2</italic> marginally better than <italic toggle="yes">edgeR</italic> in both AUROC and Top-K accuracy (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Among the remaining methods, <italic toggle="yes">DoubleExpSeq</italic> performed better than <italic toggle="yes">limma</italic>. We also benchmarked the run-time of each method (in analysing the simulation with an input query of 148 633 ASEs for two conditions each with three replicates) and found that <italic toggle="yes">limma</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">DoubleExpSeq</italic> were the fastest methods, whereas <italic toggle="yes">DESeq2</italic> was the slowest (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). From this, we concluded that each method serves different purposes. The <italic toggle="yes">limma</italic> wrapper is a useful screening tool in an initial analysis for hypothesis generation. The fast compute time of the <italic toggle="yes">limma</italic> wrapper is especially helpful in large complex datasets where exploratory analysis is performed to identify parameters of interest and identify putative batch factors. The <italic toggle="yes">DoubleExpSeq</italic> wrapper is a general-purpose fast algorithm for simple contrasts between two conditions in a univariate setting. For analyses where an accurate set of top differential ASEs is the highest priority, <italic toggle="yes">edgeR</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">DESeq2</italic> are equivalent options.</p>

      <p>Next, we compared <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> (using the <italic toggle="yes">DESeq2</italic> wrapper) against other differential AS analysis tools, namely <italic toggle="yes">rMATS</italic> [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], <italic toggle="yes">SUPPA2</italic> [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], <italic toggle="yes">MAJIQ</italic> [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], <italic toggle="yes">SGSeq</italic> [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">SplAdder</italic> [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]<italic toggle="yes">.</italic> We chose these tools as they also use the PSI metric. As each method annotates ASEs differently, we calculated AUROC and top-K accuracy values using ASEs commonly annotated by all methods (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D</xref>, <xref rid="sup2" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A</xref>).

      <title>Coverage plot normalization for intron retention</title>
      <p>Current implementations of coverage and sashimi plots are limited in showing coverage of individual samples, rather than mean coverage across replicates of each experimental condition. Combining data from replicates requires a normalization parameter. As replicates differ by both sequencing depth and gene expression, a sample-specific normalization factor is required for each gene. Moreover, variations in depth of coverage due to GC-bias and 3′- (or 5′-) bias mean that, even within the same gene, different normalization factors may be required across each genomic region.</p>
      <p>However, unlike in <italic toggle="yes">DEXSeq</italic> [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] where a statistical model is used to fit every exon, we sought a method to calculate a single normalization parameter for each ASE, which may overlap across multiple exons and introns. After normalization, the mean coverage across alternate regions should reflect their calculated PSIs, whereas coverage across constitutive regions (i.e. regions expressed by both included and excluded isoforms) should be normalized to unity. Within-group coverage means and variances can then be visualized as lines and shaded ribbons, respectively. Differences in normalized coverage can be statistically tested (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

      <p>First, we approached the case of IR and considered the simple scenario where the expressed isoform either involves splicing or retention of the intron of interest (i.e. only transcripts [RI, A] are expressed—see <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). In this case, coverage normalization should result in the exon boundaries to be anchored to unity and the average coverage across the intron should reflect the IR-ratio, as given by equation (<xref rid="deqn01" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>):</p>

      <p>In <italic toggle="yes">IRFinder</italic> [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], intronic abundance is measured using the trimmed mean of intronic coverage of sequencing reads (hereafter <italic toggle="yes">IntronDepth</italic>), which we adopted in <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>. For introns flanked by constitutively spliced exons, the read counts mapping to the splice junction across the intron of interest (hereafter <italic toggle="yes">SpliceExact</italic>) approximates spliced isoform abundance. However, in many cases, at least one exon flanking the intron of interest is also differentially spliced (e.g. due to expression of transcripts [B, C, D, E, F]—<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). To account for this, <italic toggle="yes">IRFinder</italic> estimates spliced isoform abundance using the <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic> metric [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which is calculated as follows: junction reads utilizing each of the splice junctions flanking the intron of interest are first calculated; <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic> is then determined as the larger of these two values (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). In the example illustrated in <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3(B)</xref>, the SpliceMax metric accounts for total splicing where one of the transcripts [A, B, C, D] is the major isoform.</p>
      <p>However, we observed that over-estimation of IR-ratios arises in cases where neither splice site bounding the intron of interest is shared with that of the major isoform (e.g. due to expression of transcripts [E,F] in <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). We encompassed these cases by proposing the <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic> metric which we define as follows: First, we use the transcriptome annotations to determine exon groups which are genomic regions occupied by mutually overlapping exons. Then, for the intron of interest, we quantified all splice sites that arise from the two exon groups flanking the intron of interest, rather than simply utilizing the flanking splice junction coordinates. <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic> is then determined as the larger of these two values.</p>
      <p>We hypothesized that transcript abundance (the denominator value of the IR-ratio) is best estimated using the sum of <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic> + <italic toggle="yes">IntronDepth</italic>. We compared this method against that using <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic> + <italic toggle="yes">IntronDepth</italic> which is the denominator value in calculating IR-ratios in <italic toggle="yes">IRFinder</italic> [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Using the simulated RNA-seq dataset based on THP-1 differentiation, we determined ground truth IR-ratios using known transcript abundances (see Supplementary Methods). First, we show we could reproduce <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic>-based IR-ratios in <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> by comparing these with values produced by <italic toggle="yes">IRFinder-S</italic> [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] (<xref rid="sup3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3A</xref>). Next, we compared IR-ratios derived from either <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic> against ground truth. Using replicate 1 from the THP1-M0 macrophage (simulated) sample as an example, using <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic> to estimate spliced isoform abundance resulted in less events with IR-ratio error (absolute difference between predicted and actual IR-ratios) is greater than 0.2, compared with <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic> (1.43% versus 3.56%, <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C,D</xref>). We attributed this to the overestimation (IR-ratio error &gt; 0.2) of <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic> in 1.69% of introns compared with <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic> (<xref rid="sup3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3B</xref>). Consequently, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic>, as a metric for spliced isoform abundance, more accurately estimates IR-ratios compared to <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic> (IR-ratio accuracy area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 98.73 versus 98.21, <xref rid="sup3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3C</xref>). We repeated this analysis on all samples in the simulation and found similar results (<xref rid="sup3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3D, E</xref>). Moreover, based on the simulated dataset, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz’s SpliceOver</italic> metric outperformed <italic toggle="yes">S-IRFinder</italic> in detecting differential IR events (<xref rid="sup3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3F</xref>).</p>
      <p>If transcript abundance is used as the normalization parameter for coverage, then the mean normalized coverage across introns is equivalent to their IR-ratios. Thus, we compared mean normalized coverage with their ground truth IR-ratios, using <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic> as estimates of spliced isoform abundance. We found that <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic>-based normalization outperformed <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic> at normalizing coverages (2.07 and 4.33% of introns where IR-ratios inferred from mean coverage was outside 0.2 difference with ground truth (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E, F</xref>), resulting in higher accuracy (IR-ratio error AUC 98.41 and 97.85, respectively, <xref rid="sup3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3G</xref>).</p>
      <p>Taken together, we implemented coverage normalization using a normalization parameter based on transcript depth across the intron of interest, whereby splicing abundance is measured using the <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic> metric as described above. Using this approach, normalized coverage across introns accurately reflects their IR-ratios.</p>

      <title>Differences in coverage across alternately spliced regions demonstrate differential splicing</title>
      <p>Having shown that our normalization approach results in mean normalized coverage across introns representing IR-ratios, we examined whether differences in normalized coverage can be used to demonstrate differential splicing between groups of samples. To measure differences in normalized coverages between two groups of replicates, we used a two-tailed Student’s <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test on normalized coverage (examples in <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4AC</xref>). After <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values were computed for each nucleotide, we calculated the mean of negative log-10 transformed <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values across each alternately spliced region (excluding five boundary nucleotides at each end). We performed this assessment for IR, cassette/ SE and alternate 5′/3′ splice site (A5SS/A3SS) events, whereby the alternatively spliced regions are the introns, SE and the regions between the two alternate splice sites, respectively. We excluded MXE, AFE and ALE events from the analysis as these types of events involve inclusion of two mutually exclusive exons. We also removed from the analysis A5SS/A3SS events where the two alternative splice sites were separated by an intron belonging to an interfering annotated transcript. We evaluated the mean negative log-10 transformed <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values from the Student’s <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test (hereafter referred to as the T-score) as a discriminator to detect differential events.</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="bbad468f4" position="float"/>
      </fig>
      <p>We first benchmarked this approach using our simulated dataset, using all ground truth differential ASEs (with ΔPSI &gt;0.05) and nine times as many randomly chosen non-differential ASEs, such that there are 10% differential events. We found that the T-score performed well and was best for IR, followed by SE and then A5SS/A3SS (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Importantly, we found this test was superior for events in which the mean PSI was low (i.e. the alternately spliced region is predominantly excluded across all samples) than those in which the mean PSI was high (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E–G</xref>). Interestingly, when we controlled for PSI by subsetting events using the criterion PSI &lt; 0.1 (<xref rid="sup4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4A, B</xref>), there were only negligible differences in accuracy pertaining to different types of ASE (<xref rid="sup4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4C</xref>). This suggests that the PSI is the major determinant of accuracy when using coverage to visualize differential splicing.</p>
      <p>Next, we benchmarked this approach using two real datasets. We chose the THP-1 monocyte to M0-macrophage differentiation by Green <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> ([<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], GSE130011) as an example of deep RNA sequencing (~100 million 150-nt paired end reads per sample) and the dual TRA2A/TRA2B knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells by Best <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> ([<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], GSE59335) as an example RNA sequencing dataset of a more typical depth (~25 million 100-nt paired end reads per sample). As ground truth differential ASEs cannot be experimentally determined transcriptome-wide, we instead used <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> to perform edgeR-based differential AS analysis as comparison. Events with a false-discovery rate FDR &lt; 0.05 and ΔPSI &gt;0.05 were considered differential ASEs.</p>
      <p>First, we addressed whether <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>-based reanalysis could replicate prior findings. The Green <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> dataset is known to contain many IR events downregulated in monocyte–macrophage transition [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], whereas the Best <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> dataset shows widespread SE in dual TRA2A/TRA2B knockdown [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Reanalysis of the Green <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> dataset identified 866 and 129 down-regulated and upregulated IR events, respectively, during monocyte–macrophage differentiation. In the Best <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> dataset, 821 and 80 differentially skipped and included exons, respectively, due to dual TRA2A/TRA2B knockdown were identified. Thus, in both datasets, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> reanalysis confirmed prior findings.</p>
      <p>Next, we measured the accuracy of <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz’s</italic> coverage plots. Again, we benchmarked IR, SE, and A5SS/A3SS differential ASEs and randomly chosen non-differential ASEs such that there are 10% true positive differential events. We observed similar findings, specifically, that the test was more useful for IR than for other types of ASEs (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H, I</xref>), and that this approach was more accurate at low PSI (<xref rid="sup4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4D–H</xref>). From this, we concluded that the difference in the performance of coverage plot-based differential splicing visualization between types of AS is largely due to the distribution of PSIs for each type of ASE, (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J, K</xref>). Furthermore, using down-sampling of reads in the THP-1 (Green <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.) dataset, we showed that lower sequencing depth led to lower accuracy (<xref rid="sup4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4I–K</xref>), which could explain the slightly better accuracy in the Green <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> dataset compared with the Best <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> dataset.</p>
      <p>Taken together, we conclude that group-mean coverage plots are most accurate at demonstrating differential IR but are also useful for demonstrating other forms of AS. Importantly, coverage plots are more accurate at visualizing differential splicing where alternatively spliced regions are predominantly excluded (i.e. at low PSI).</p>

      <title>Interactive exploration of differential analysis</title>
      <p>Without tools to interact with the results of differential analysis, identifying top functionally relevant candidates for experimental validation is a manual process that is cumbersome and inefficient. To streamline exploratory analysis downstream to differential analysis, we implemented a series of interactive visualization tools that allow users to identify a set of relevant ASEs following differential analysis.</p>
      <p>As a case study, we use M1 macrophage differentiation from naïve M0 macrophages to illustrate the features (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). After differential ASE analysis was performed in contrasting samples from M0 and M1 macrophage differentiation, top differential events can be visualized using interactive volcano plots (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B, C</xref>) or by scatter plots (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Using the mouse, users can highlight ASEs on either plot using box or lasso select tools. In our example, selecting the top events in the volcano plot (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) leads to highlighting of the same events in the split volcano plot (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>) and scatter plot (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Following this, highlighted ASEs can be used to perform GO enrichment analysis (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>), using as background either the entire set of genes from the annotation, or genes hosting one or more ASEs. Heatmaps can be generated either from top differential ASEs by significance, user-selected ASEs, or ASEs from a GO term (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F, G</xref>). From the heatmap, users can identify ASEs of interest and visualize these as coverage plots (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H, I, J</xref>).</p>

      <title>Performance optimization in SpliceWiz</title>
      <p>Apart from alignment of raw sequencing reads, the processing of alignment BAM files is the most time-consuming step of AS analysis pipelines. In <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>, BAM files are parsed to count reads aligned across splice junctions, calculate coverage depth across introns, and record coverage for generating coverage plots. Although coverage can be retrieved directly from parsing of coordinate-sorted BAM files, these files are very large and not suitable for transfer between collaborators. As such, an extra step is required to retrieve and compress coverage data as a separate file (traditionally, as BigWig files). Thus, we identified the parsing of alignment files and the storage/recall of coverage data as the two key areas that required performance optimization.</p>
      <p>In R, the <italic toggle="yes">htslib</italic> C library [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] (provided via the <italic toggle="yes">Rhtslib</italic> package) is the key developer tool for creating C or C++ − based functions (callable via R) to parse BAM files. Although multi-threaded BAM parsing is supported, downstream access of decompressed data is not thread safe (i.e. reads cannot be processed in a multi-threaded manner). Thus, computationally intensive downstream processing of alignments is not thread-scalable. To overcome this, we developed <italic toggle="yes">ompBAM,</italic> a novel C++ library (provided by the <italic toggle="yes">ompBAM</italic> R package available via <italic toggle="yes">Bioconductor</italic>). Using this resource, developers can create <italic toggle="yes">Rcpp</italic>-based functions to parse and analyse alignment BAM files using multiple threads. Unlike <italic toggle="yes">htslib</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ompBAM</italic> decompresses alignments which can be later accessed in a thread-safe manner. This allows computationally intensive functions to be thread scalable as downstream processing is no longer bottlenecked at a single thread. <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> uses <italic toggle="yes">ompBAM</italic> for all functions that require parsing of BAM files.</p>
      <p>To demonstrate the performance of <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>, we processed alignments from the simulated dataset using an incremental number of threads and showed that runtime decreased with increasing number of threads indicating thread-scalability (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref>, <xref rid="sup5" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A</xref>), with only modest increase in memory consumption (<xref rid="sup5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5B</xref>) thereby improving per-thread memory consumption (<xref rid="sup5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5C</xref>). Next, we benchmarked <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> against the BAM-processing step from a range of AS tools. Using the same number of threads, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> outperformed most of the other tools tested, except for <italic toggle="yes">IRFinder-S</italic> (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), (noting that <italic toggle="yes">IRFinder-S</italic> does not natively support multi-threading and was parallelized using <italic toggle="yes">BiocParallel</italic> via R). Importantly, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is orders of magnitude faster than other AS tools on R/Bioconductor (namely, <italic toggle="yes">ASpli</italic> [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], <italic toggle="yes">SGSeq</italic> [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">IntEREst</italic> [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]).</p>

      <p>Next, we needed a fast method to store and recall stranded coverage data. As <italic toggle="yes">BigWig</italic> [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] (the current standard for storing coverage data) only supports storage of a single vector of data, each sample would require two <italic toggle="yes">BigWig</italic> files to store stranded coverage data. Thus, we designed a new COV format, which is a BGZF-compressed self-indexed format that stores coverage data for both positive, negative and unstranded data (see Supplementary Methods). Using two datasets, we demonstrate that the COV format shows storage efficiency gains over <italic toggle="yes">BigWig</italic> (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). COV file generation is thread-scalable, and at 4+ threads, it is faster than <italic toggle="yes">megadepth</italic> [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], the current fastest tool for generating <italic toggle="yes">BigWig</italic> files (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Importantly, in the default workflow for <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>, COV files are generated simultaneously with BAM parsing to quantify splice metrics, such that BAM files are processed only once (<xref rid="sup5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5D</xref>). Data recall using COV files is also faster than equivalent functions that use <italic toggle="yes">BigWig</italic> files. <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> retrieves binned-average coverage faster than R-based tools that utilize <italic toggle="yes">BigWig</italic>, namely, <italic toggle="yes">megadepth</italic> [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">rtracklayer</italic> [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). This increased performance is due to the greatly improved raw data retrieval time using <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz’s</italic> unique COV format (<xref rid="sup5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5E</xref>).</p>
      <p>Taken together, we successfully optimized the performance of <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>, focusing on alignment file parsing and coverage data storage and recall times. These improvements make <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> suitable for analysing large datasets and generating coverage plots in real time during interactive exploratory analyses.</p>

      <title>Scalability of <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> to large datasets</title>
      <p>The computational optimization in <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> allows scalability of R-based differential splicing analysis to large datasets. Additionally, for complex datasets with three or more experimental groups, users may wish to perform differential analysis multiple times to test splicing differences between each pair of groups. In both <italic toggle="yes">rMATS</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MAJIQ</italic>, performing each comparison requires the re-parsing of intermediate output files for every sample, leading to redundancies in computation. <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> addresses this via its collation step (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), whereby intermediate output files for each sample are parsed once, unified into count matrices, and compressed into output files along with an abridged version of the splicing reference. Differential analysis is performed by importing the collated dataset from file, rather than by parsing intermediate files of every sample. This design allows <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> datasets to be portable and easy to share among researchers.</p>
      <p>To demonstrate the scalability of <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> and the utility of its modular design to reduce the run time of the downstream differential AS analysis, we analysed 263 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) RNA-seq samples from the Leucegene dataset [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. For each of the tools (<italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">rMATS</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MAJIQ</italic>), we used a maximum of eight threads. Additionally, for <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MAJIQ</italic>, we restricted the available memory to 32 gigabytes. We benchmarked run times for each phase (processing of alignment BAM files, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> dataset collation and differential analysis between two groups) using the full dataset (263 samples). This benchmark showed that <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is the fastest tool for both processing of alignment files and subsequent differential analysis (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref rid="TB2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Even when taking to account the extra step of dataset collation, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> remains the fastest tool.</p>

      <p>Next, we wanted to compare the accuracy of differential analysis in a larger dataset. We assessed accuracy of differential splicing analysis using a simulated dataset based on a subset of the Leucegene dataset (10 acute promyelocytic leukemia samples and 10 randomly chosen AML controls). Accuracy metrics showed that <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> outperformed both <italic toggle="yes">rMATS</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MAJIQ</italic> (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B, C</xref>, <xref rid="TB2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>
      <p>Taken together, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> scales well to large datasets with respect to computational performance and accuracy.

  <sec id="sec12">
    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>We demonstrated <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> as a versatile R package for AS analysis. Benchmarks against comparison tools show that <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is accurate and computationally efficient. Furthermore, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> implements a novel AS event-based coverage normalization to generate group coverage plots to accurately visualize differential splicing across conditions. Through the <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> GUI, we have also implemented an interactive visualization-based pipeline to enhance the user experience and assist in identifying functionally relevant ASEs for further study.</p>
    <p>There are many approaches to benchmarking AS tools to assess accuracy. A key aspect is the assumption of how PSI values are statistically distributed. Our assumption that PSI values are beta distributed is based on the intuition that during sequencing, reads are being randomly sampled from cDNA fragments derived from source RNA that belong to either ‘included’ or ‘excluded’ isoforms. Hence, our benchmarks naturally favour tools that make similar statistical assumptions, namely <italic toggle="yes">rMATS</italic> [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">SGSeq</italic> [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In contrast, benchmarks that showed <italic toggle="yes">SUPPA2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MAJIQ</italic> outperforming <italic toggle="yes">rMATS</italic> were performed based on error models applied to changes in PSI (ΔPSI) as a linear quantity [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Accordingly, <italic toggle="yes">SUPPA2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MAJIQ</italic> performed less favourably on our benchmarks. Importantly, focussing on PSI as a linear difference between two conditions result in the loss of information about the baseline PSI. When the baseline PSI is close to zero, changes in PSI (e.g. PSI from 0.01 to 0.03, or from 0.99 to 0.97) results in a higher fold-change in logit transformed PSI compared to examples where the baseline PSI is in the center of the [0,1] interval (e.g. PSI 0.49–&gt; 0.51). Thus, like <italic toggle="yes">rMATS</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">SGSeq, SpliceWiz’s</italic> statistical approach is sensitive in detecting ASEs with baseline PSIs close to 0 or 1, which in practice encompasses most ASEs in real datasets (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J, K</xref>).</p>
    <p>Prior studies have attempted to combine sample replicates into a single plot. <italic toggle="yes">ggsashimi</italic> [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] combines replicates by stacking traces of raw coverage, using different levels of transparency to show multiple histograms. This approach is limited in its ability to adjust for variances in sequencing depth and gene expressions between replicates, which vary independently of changes in PSI. <italic toggle="yes">Manananggal</italic> [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] implemented an exon-based visualization using a <italic toggle="yes">DEXSeq’s</italic> exon normalization backend, and more recently <italic toggle="yes">VALERIE</italic> [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] implemented an exon-based visualization used a PSI-based normalization which scales coverage based on sum included/excluded junction reads. These approaches are limited in their inability to visualize IR due to their exon-only approach.</p>
    <p>Our benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic> normalization metric estimates local transcript depth to accurately visualize IR. Moreover, group differences in normalized coverage across alternatively spliced regions accurately visualize differential splicing. Importantly, coverage plots are poor at identifying differential events at PSI close to 1. We surmise that this is because coverage plots are asymmetric in their quantitative representation of included and excluded isoforms. Included isoforms are represented by coverage, whereas excluded isoforms are represented only using numbered arcs in sashimi plots. At a PSI close to one, fold change signals in the isoforms are represented as loss of coverage and is hidden among the noise of coverage variances of the included isoform. This finding uncovers a general weakness of coverage plots, which is unrelated to our normalization approach. Naturally, as most IR events have a PSI close to zero whereas other types of ASEs have a bimodal distribution of PSIs around the 0 and 1 boundaries, coverage plots most accurately visualize IR. Nevertheless, coverage plots remain a useful visualization of AS due to its representation of the raw alignment data underpinning splicing quantitation. As larger RNA sequencing datasets become more available, the prior approach of representing a sample group using duplicate/triplicate samples will be replaced by <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz’s</italic> approach of representing the entire group via normalized coverage. Thus, normalized coverage plots will become the new standard for AS visualization.</p>
    <p>The <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> GUI provides an interactive platform allowing users to explore the results of differential ASE analysis. This platform is designed to highlight interesting and relevant ASEs for further investigation. The choice of ASEs to experimentally verify typically depends on several factors, including the reliability of the measurements and the relevance of affected genes to the functional pathways of interest. Measurement reliability can be visually surveyed using <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz’s</italic> normalized coverage plots. Moreover, GO enrichment analysis and GO-based heatmaps facilitate the identification of functionally relevant ASEs. These tools represent a considerable improvement over current methods, which typically provide tabular lists of the top differential results without companion tools or capabilities for functional annotation. Taken together, the interactivity in exploring the differential analysis results improves the user experience and the efficacy in identifying functionally relevant ‘top hits’ for experimental validation.</p>
    <p>Computational performance is a key aspect to the user experience of any bioinformatics tool. We optimized <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> to process BAM files orders of magnitude faster than other Bioconductor tools for AS analysis, and on par with command-line tools. Moreover, coverage data stored in <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz’s COV</italic> format is more efficient than <italic toggle="yes">BigWig</italic>, which facilitates data transfer between collaborators. These optimizations encourage researchers to analyse AS alongside gene expression, and provide biologists and bioinformaticians with the same platform, thereby enhancing collaboration and communication.</p>
    <p>AS databases, whereby AS quantitation has been performed on large RNA-seq datasets in advance, are in growing demand. Recently, numerous AS databases have been published, covering various biological systems including diverse human and murine tissues [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], cancers [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36–38</xref>] and COVID-19 [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> provides an ideal platform to create AS databases due to its ability to uniformly analyse and package data from large datasets. <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>-generated AS databases are superior in that it can be used in conjunction with coverage data (via COV files) to visualize differential AS between customizable sample groups. This feature would add to the level of granularity that is required to identify the most meaningful AS events and examine them in the appropriate context. We anticipate that <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> will become the preferred platform for publishing AS database resources going forward.</p>
    <p>Although <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is primarily designed for bulk RNA-seq datasets, alignments from individual or clusters of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can theoretically be analysed using <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>. However, like most AS tools designed for bulk RNA-seq, their use in parsing scRNA-seq is limited by their reliance on full-transcriptome protocols. As most scRNA-seq datasets use 3′-based sequencing, most AS events cannot be properly analysed or visualized. Another limitation of <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is its inability to correct for technical confounders of sequencing coverage (such as GC and 5′/3′ bias) in its coverage visualization, as <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> only uses a single normalization factor per sample for each ASE. Although batch-correction is a feature implemented in <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> via its GLM-based differential analysis, batch correction cannot be factored into its coverage normalization algorithm.</p>
    <p>In summary, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is a fast, accessible and user-friendly interactive tool for AS analysis, and sets a new standard in splicing visualization via group normalized coverage plots.</p>

Columns in these matrices represent samples whereas rows represent ASEs. During differential expression analysis, two separate analyses are performed. First, differential analysis is performed separately on each of library-normalized included and excluded counts. Assuming a contrasting condition ‘Treatment’ and a batch factor condition ‘Batch’, the model is described in equation (<xref rid="deqn03" ref-type="disp-formula">3</xref>), where the last term is the contrasting term.

However, the analysis and visualization of AS events from RNA sequencing data remains challenging. Most tools require a certain level of computer literacy and the available means of visualizing AS events, such as coverage and sashimi plots, have limitations and can be misleading. To address these issues, we present <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>, an R package with an interactive Shiny interface that allows easy and efficient AS analysis and visualization at scale. A novel normalization algorithm is implemented to aggregate splicing levels within sample groups, thereby allowing group differences in splicing levels to be accurately visualized. The tool also offers downstream gene ontology enrichment analysis, highlighting ASEs belonging to functional pathways of interest. <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is optimized for speed and efficiency and introduces a new file format for coverage data storage that is more efficient than BigWig. Alignment files are processed orders of magnitude faster than other R-based AS analysis tools and on par with command-line tools. Overall, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> streamlines AS analysis, enabling reliable identification of functionally relevant AS events for further characterization. <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is a Bioconductor package and is also available on GitHub (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/alexchwong/SpliceWiz" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/alexchwong/SpliceWiz</ext-link>).</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Alternative splicing (AS) is a regulated process whereby alternate blocks of protein coding information, exons, are selectively transferred during or after transcription of messenger RNA from DNA. Introns, sequences interspersed between exons, are removed by the spliceosome at their donor (5′) and acceptor (3′) splice sites. AS arises consequent to enhanced or inhibited recognition of splice sites [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], leading to selective retention or removal of extra genetic information during or after transcription. Although AS can be complex, at its essence, there are seven basic forms [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], namely inclusion/skipping of cassette exons (skipped exons, SE), inclusion of mutually exclusive exons (MXE), alternative 5′/3′ splice site usage (A5SS/A3SS), alternative first or last exons (AFE/ALE) and intron retention (IR) (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>). These alternative splicing events (ASEs) are defined as a binary choice between ‘inclusion’ or ‘exclusion’ of the alternate exon, partial exon or intron. ASEs can be quantified using RNA sequencing reads aligned across alternate splice sites (hereafter junction reads) [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and are visualized using coverage or sashimi plots [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. AS allows a single gene to give rise to multiple messenger RNA transcripts from the same DNA template, which in turn can translate different proteins [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Additionally, retained introns can affect transcript localization and degradation, leading to altered expression [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
    <p>Despite the ready availability of RNA sequencing, including a vast volume of publicly available datasets, AS analysis is not routinely performed. Most tools for AS analysis are command-line based, hindering their accessibility to those not familiar with such interfaces. Coverage and sashimi plot visualization is limited by the lack of methods to normalize coverage at genomic regions of ASEs. If such methods existed, differential splicing between conditions could be visualized using mean normalized coverage of replicates within each condition. Individual samples from each condition with large differences in coverage can often be found even in ASEs with no significant differential splicing between conditions. Thus, the current practice of selecting ‘representative individual samples’ is flawed and leads to publication bias. Finally, data interactivity is lacking in current tools, particularly downstream to differential splicing analysis. Interactive data exploration tools would facilitate the process of identifying functionally relevant ASEs for further study.</p>
    <p>To address the above limitations, we created <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>, an AS analysis and visualization tool. <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is implemented as an R package and provides both graphical and command-line user interfaces. Starting from input bulk RNA sequencing alignment files (BAM files), <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> quantifies AS using junction reads and intronic coverage, leveraging novel junction reads to detect cryptic splice sites and exons. Differential analysis is performed using established statistical tools available in R, allowing generalized linear model (GLM) based analysis to accommodate large complex datasets. We propose a coverage normalization method to visualize IR ratios, and show that this approach accurately visualizes differential AS. A variety of interactive visualization tools are implemented, including gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, to facilitate identification of reliable candidate ASEs relevant to the observed biological phenomena. Finally, to improve computational performance we optimized storage and retrieval of sequencing coverage using a new file format, implemented alongside multi-threaded parsing of alignment files. Taken together, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is an accessible, user-friendly and computationally efficient application that streamlines AS analysis, focussing on reliably identifying functionally relevant ASEs for further characterization.</p>

      <title>The <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> pipeline</title>
      <p>We implemented <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> as an R package, with both a command-line and graphical interface, the latter implemented via <italic toggle="yes">shinyDashboard</italic>. We organized the <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> pipeline in a modular format, as follows (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>):</p>

        <caption>
          <p>The SpliceWiz pipeline is organized into four modules. ‘Reference’ creates the SpliceWiz alternative splicing annotations required for processing alignments. ‘Experiment’ contains functions to process alignment files and collate their outputs into a dataset. ‘Analyse’ imports this dataset, allowing users to review quality control metrics and perform pre-test filtering of lowly-represented ASEs, and performs differential analysis to generate a table of results. ‘Display’ provides visualization tools, including volcano and scatter plots, gene ontology enrichment analysis, heatmaps and coverage plots.</p>

      <p>This design allows users with limited programming experience to use the graphical interface to run the full pipeline while enabling those with more bioinformatics experience to automate processes via the command line. Users can apply successive filters on the differential ASEs by directly selecting individual or groups of ASEs from volcano and scatter plots, and/or via gene ontology analysis. Interactively selected ASEs can then be collectively visualized using heatmaps and individually via <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz’s</italic> coverage plots.</p>

    <sec id="sec6">
      <title>Differential analysis</title>
      <p>We implemented a GLM-based approach to differential ASE analysis to accommodate large datasets with complex experimental designs, including time series analysis, and accounting for batch effects. Many established statistical methods using GLMs already exist for gene expression analysis, the most cited being <italic toggle="yes">limma</italic> [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], <italic toggle="yes">DESeq2</italic> [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">edgeR</italic> [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For GLM-based differential AS analysis, we implemented wrapper functions in <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> to utilize each of these statistical tools (see Methods). We also implemented a wrapper function for <italic toggle="yes">DoubleExpSeq</italic> [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], a fast statistical method in R for differential AS analysis using simple contrasts between two conditions (see Methods).</p>
      <p>To assess the accuracy of these algorithms at identifying differential ASEs, we simulated reads to emulate transcript expression and technical parameters derived from a real RNA-seq dataset (THP-1 monocyte to macrophage differentiation [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]) using RSEM [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We used the percent-spliced-in (PSI) metric to quantify AS, which is determined based on known transcript expression values (see Methods). From these PSI values, a set of ground truth differential events were defined by modelling PSIs using a beta distribution (see Supplementary Methods). Accuracy was measured using two parameters: (i) to assess a method’s ability to accurately detect and appropriately rank the full set of differential events, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values were calculated for each method. (ii) To assess precision of the top ranked events in the analysis, we calculated the proportion of ground truth events that overlap with the top K predicted differential events, where K is the number of ground truth differential events in the simulation (hereafter Top-K accuracy).</p>
      <p>We first compared the performance of each statistical wrapper implemented in <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> (<xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We found that <italic toggle="yes">DESeq2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">edgeR</italic> were the top performers, with <italic toggle="yes">DESeq2</italic> marginally better than <italic toggle="yes">edgeR</italic> in both AUROC and Top-K accuracy (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Among the remaining methods, <italic toggle="yes">DoubleExpSeq</italic> performed better than <italic toggle="yes">limma</italic>. We also benchmarked the run-time of each method (in analysing the simulation with an input query of 148 633 ASEs for two conditions each with three replicates) and found that <italic toggle="yes">limma</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">DoubleExpSeq</italic> were the fastest methods, whereas <italic toggle="yes">DESeq2</italic> was the slowest (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). From this, we concluded that each method serves different purposes. The <italic toggle="yes">limma</italic> wrapper is a useful screening tool in an initial analysis for hypothesis generation. The fast compute time of the <italic toggle="yes">limma</italic> wrapper is especially helpful in large complex datasets where exploratory analysis is performed to identify parameters of interest and identify putative batch factors. The <italic toggle="yes">DoubleExpSeq</italic> wrapper is a general-purpose fast algorithm for simple contrasts between two conditions in a univariate setting. For analyses where an accurate set of top differential ASEs is the highest priority, <italic toggle="yes">edgeR</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">DESeq2</italic> are equivalent options.</p>

      <p>Next, we compared <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> (using the <italic toggle="yes">DESeq2</italic> wrapper) against other differential AS analysis tools, namely <italic toggle="yes">rMATS</italic> [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], <italic toggle="yes">SUPPA2</italic> [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], <italic toggle="yes">MAJIQ</italic> [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], <italic toggle="yes">SGSeq</italic> [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">SplAdder</italic> [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]<italic toggle="yes">.</italic> We chose these tools as they also use the PSI metric. As each method annotates ASEs differently, we calculated AUROC and top-K accuracy values using ASEs commonly annotated by all methods (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D</xref>, <xref rid="sup2" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A</xref>). This benchmark identified <italic toggle="yes">SGSeq</italic> as the best performer followed closely by <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>. Additionally, we performed pairwise comparisons using ASEs common to each pair of methods.

      <p>Taken together, we conclude that our implementation of GLM-based differential splicing performs well compared with other tools that perform differential AS analysis based on PSI values.</p>

      <title>Coverage plot normalization for intron retention</title>
      <p>Current implementations of coverage and sashimi plots are limited in showing coverage of individual samples, rather than mean coverage across replicates of each experimental condition. Combining data from replicates requires a normalization parameter. As replicates differ by both sequencing depth and gene expression, a sample-specific normalization factor is required for each gene. Moreover, variations in depth of coverage due to GC-bias and 3′- (or 5′-) bias mean that, even within the same gene, different normalization factors may be required across each genomic region.</p>
      <p>However, unlike in <italic toggle="yes">DEXSeq</italic> [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] where a statistical model is used to fit every exon, we sought a method to calculate a single normalization parameter for each ASE, which may overlap across multiple exons and introns. After normalization, the mean coverage across alternate regions should reflect their calculated PSIs, whereas coverage across constitutive regions (i.e. regions expressed by both included and excluded isoforms) should be normalized to unity. Within-group coverage means and variances can then be visualized as lines and shaded ribbons, respectively. Differences in normalized coverage can be statistically tested (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>
      <fig position="float" id="f3">

          <p>Coverage plot normalization for IR. (<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing coverage normalization (i) is required prior to combining replicates by group to produce mean normalized coverage plots per condition (ii).

(Bottom) Schematic of theoretical raw coverage attributed to expression of transcripts as color-coded in the transcript annotation above.

      <p>First, we approached the case of IR and considered the simple scenario where the expressed isoform either involves splicing or retention of the intron of interest (i.e. only transcripts [RI, A] are expressed—see <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). In this case, coverage normalization should result in the exon boundaries to be anchored to unity and the average coverage across the intron should reflect the IR-ratio, as given by equation (<xref rid="deqn01" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>):</p>

      <p>In <italic toggle="yes">IRFinder</italic> [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], intronic abundance is measured using the trimmed mean of intronic coverage of sequencing reads (hereafter <italic toggle="yes">IntronDepth</italic>), which we adopted in <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>. For introns flanked by constitutively spliced exons, the read counts mapping to the splice junction across the intron of interest (hereafter <italic toggle="yes">SpliceExact</italic>) approximates spliced isoform abundance. However, in many cases, at least one exon flanking the intron of interest is also differentially spliced (e.g. due to expression of transcripts [B, C, D, E, F]—<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). To account for this, <italic toggle="yes">IRFinder</italic> estimates spliced isoform abundance using the <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic> metric [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which is calculated as follows: junction reads utilizing each of the splice junctions flanking the intron of interest are first calculated; <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic> is then determined as the larger of these two values (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). In the example illustrated in <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3(B)</xref>, the SpliceMax metric accounts for total splicing where one of the transcripts [A, B, C, D] is the major isoform.</p>
      <p>However, we observed that over-estimation of IR-ratios arises in cases where neither splice site bounding the intron of interest is shared with that of the major isoform (e.g. due to expression of transcripts [E,F] in <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). We encompassed these cases by proposing the <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic> metric which we define as follows: First, we use the transcriptome annotations to determine exon groups which are genomic regions occupied by mutually overlapping exons. Then, for the intron of interest, we quantified all splice sites that arise from the two exon groups flanking the intron of interest, rather than simply utilizing the flanking splice junction coordinates. <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic> is then determined as the larger of these two values.</p>
      <p>We hypothesized that transcript abundance (the denominator value of the IR-ratio) is best estimated using the sum of <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic> + <italic toggle="yes">IntronDepth</italic>. We compared this method against that using <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic> + <italic toggle="yes">IntronDepth</italic> which is the denominator value in calculating IR-ratios in <italic toggle="yes">IRFinder</italic> [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Using the simulated RNA-seq dataset based on THP-1 differentiation, we determined ground truth IR-ratios using known transcript abundances (see Supplementary Methods). First, we show we could reproduce <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic>-based IR-ratios in <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> by comparing these with values produced by <italic toggle="yes">IRFinder-S</italic> [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] (<xref rid="sup3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3A</xref>). Next, we compared IR-ratios derived from either <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic> against ground truth. Using replicate 1 from the THP1-M0 macrophage (simulated) sample as an example, using <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic> to estimate spliced isoform abundance resulted in less events with IR-ratio error (absolute difference between predicted and actual IR-ratios) is greater than 0.2, compared with <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic> (1.43% versus 3.56%, <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C,D</xref>). We attributed this to the overestimation (IR-ratio error &gt; 0.2) of <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic> in 1.69% of introns compared with <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic> (<xref rid="sup3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3B</xref>). Consequently, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic>, as a metric for spliced isoform abundance, more accurately estimates IR-ratios compared to <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic> (IR-ratio accuracy area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 98.73 versus 98.21, <xref rid="sup3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3C</xref>). We repeated this analysis on all samples in the simulation and found similar results (<xref rid="sup3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3D, E</xref>). Moreover, based on the simulated dataset, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz’s SpliceOver</italic> metric outperformed <italic toggle="yes">S-IRFinder</italic> in detecting differential IR events (<xref rid="sup3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3F</xref>).</p>
      <p>If transcript abundance is used as the normalization parameter for coverage, then the mean normalized coverage across introns is equivalent to their IR-ratios. Thus, we compared mean normalized coverage with their ground truth IR-ratios, using <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic> as estimates of spliced isoform abundance. We found that <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic>-based normalization outperformed <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic> at normalizing coverages (2.07 and 4.33% of introns where IR-ratios inferred from mean coverage was outside 0.2 difference with ground truth (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E, F</xref>), resulting in higher accuracy (IR-ratio error AUC 98.41 and 97.85, respectively, <xref rid="sup3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3G</xref>).</p>
      <p>Taken together, we implemented coverage normalization using a normalization parameter based on transcript depth across the intron of interest, whereby splicing abundance is measured using the <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic> metric as described above. Using this approach, normalized coverage across introns accurately reflects their IR-ratios.</p>

      <title>Differences in coverage across alternately spliced regions demonstrate differential splicing</title>
      <p>Having shown that our normalization approach results in mean normalized coverage across introns representing IR-ratios, we examined whether differences in normalized coverage can be used to demonstrate differential splicing between groups of samples. To measure differences in normalized coverages between two groups of replicates, we used a two-tailed Student’s <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test on normalized coverage (examples in <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4AC</xref>). After <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values were computed for each nucleotide, we calculated the mean of negative log-10 transformed <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values across each alternately spliced region (excluding five boundary nucleotides at each end). We performed this assessment for IR, cassette/ SE and alternate 5′/3′ splice site (A5SS/A3SS) events, whereby the alternatively spliced regions are the introns, SE and the regions between the two alternate splice sites, respectively. We excluded MXE, AFE and ALE events from the analysis as these types of events involve inclusion of two mutually exclusive exons. We also removed from the analysis A5SS/A3SS events where the two alternative splice sites were separated by an intron belonging to an interfering annotated transcript. We evaluated the mean negative log-10 transformed <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values from the Student’s <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test (hereafter referred to as the T-score) as a discriminator to detect differential events.</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="bbad468f4" position="float"/>
      </fig>
      <p>We first benchmarked this approach using our simulated dataset, using all ground truth differential ASEs (with ΔPSI &gt;0.05) and nine times as many randomly chosen non-differential ASEs, such that there are 10% differential events. We found that the T-score performed well and was best for IR, followed by SE and then A5SS/A3SS (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Importantly, we found this test was superior for events in which the mean PSI was low (i.e. the alternately spliced region is predominantly excluded across all samples) than those in which the mean PSI was high (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E–G</xref>). Interestingly, when we controlled for PSI by subsetting events using the criterion PSI &lt; 0.1 (<xref rid="sup4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4A, B</xref>), there were only negligible differences in accuracy pertaining to different types of ASE (<xref rid="sup4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4C</xref>). This suggests that the PSI is the major determinant of accuracy when using coverage to visualize differential splicing.</p>
      <p>Next, we benchmarked this approach using two real datasets. We chose the THP-1 monocyte to M0-macrophage differentiation by Green <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> ([<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], GSE130011) as an example of deep RNA sequencing (~100 million 150-nt paired end reads per sample) and the dual TRA2A/TRA2B knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells by Best <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> ([<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], GSE59335) as an example RNA sequencing dataset of a more typical depth (~25 million 100-nt paired end reads per sample). As ground truth differential ASEs cannot be experimentally determined transcriptome-wide, we instead used <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> to perform edgeR-based differential AS analysis as comparison. Events with a false-discovery rate FDR &lt; 0.05 and ΔPSI &gt;0.05 were considered differential ASEs.</p>
      <p>First, we addressed whether <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>-based reanalysis could replicate prior findings. The Green <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> dataset is known to contain many IR events downregulated in monocyte–macrophage transition [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], whereas the Best <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> dataset shows widespread SE in dual TRA2A/TRA2B knockdown [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Reanalysis of the Green <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> dataset identified 866 and 129 down-regulated and upregulated IR events, respectively, during monocyte–macrophage differentiation. In the Best <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> dataset, 821 and 80 differentially skipped and included exons, respectively, due to dual TRA2A/TRA2B knockdown were identified. Thus, in both datasets, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> reanalysis confirmed prior findings.</p>
      <p>Next, we measured the accuracy of <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz’s</italic> coverage plots. Again, we benchmarked IR, SE, and A5SS/A3SS differential ASEs and randomly chosen non-differential ASEs such that there are 10% true positive differential events. We observed similar findings, specifically, that the test was more useful for IR than for other types of ASEs (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H, I</xref>), and that this approach was more accurate at low PSI (<xref rid="sup4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4D–H</xref>). From this, we concluded that the difference in the performance of coverage plot-based differential splicing visualization between types of AS is largely due to the distribution of PSIs for each type of ASE, (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J, K</xref>). Furthermore, using down-sampling of reads in the THP-1 (Green <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.) dataset, we showed that lower sequencing depth led to lower accuracy (<xref rid="sup4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4I–K</xref>), which could explain the slightly better accuracy in the Green <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> dataset compared with the Best <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> dataset.</p>
      <p>Taken together, we conclude that group-mean coverage plots are most accurate at demonstrating differential IR but are also useful for demonstrating other forms of AS. Importantly, coverage plots are more accurate at visualizing differential splicing where alternatively spliced regions are predominantly excluded (i.e. at low PSI).</p>

      <title>Interactive exploration of differential analysis</title>
      <p>Without tools to interact with the results of differential analysis, identifying top functionally relevant candidates for experimental validation is a manual process that is cumbersome and inefficient. To streamline exploratory analysis downstream to differential analysis, we implemented a series of interactive visualization tools that allow users to identify a set of relevant ASEs following differential analysis.</p>
      <p>As a case study, we use M1 macrophage differentiation from naïve M0 macrophages to illustrate the features (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). After differential ASE analysis was performed in contrasting samples from M0 and M1 macrophage differentiation, top differential events can be visualized using interactive volcano plots (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B, C</xref>) or by scatter plots (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Using the mouse, users can highlight ASEs on either plot using box or lasso select tools. In our example, selecting the top events in the volcano plot (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) leads to highlighting of the same events in the split volcano plot (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>) and scatter plot (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Following this, highlighted ASEs can be used to perform GO enrichment analysis (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>), using as background either the entire set of genes from the annotation, or genes hosting one or more ASEs. Heatmaps can be generated either from top differential ASEs by significance, user-selected ASEs, or ASEs from a GO term (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F, G</xref>). From the heatmap, users can identify ASEs of interest and visualize these as coverage plots (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H, I, J</xref>).</p>

      <p>Thus, interactive data exploration downstream to differential analysis is a core feature of <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>, in contrast to currently available tools. Identifying the top functionally relevant ASEs for experimental validation and further study is a key crossroad in any study involving high-throughput AS analysis. Our GUI-based implementation streamlines this process and helps researchers pick the best candidate ASEs without requiring external tools or manual annotation.</p>

      <title>Performance optimization in SpliceWiz</title>
      <p>Apart from alignment of raw sequencing reads, the processing of alignment BAM files is the most time-consuming step of AS analysis pipelines. In <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>, BAM files are parsed to count reads aligned across splice junctions, calculate coverage depth across introns, and record coverage for generating coverage plots. Although coverage can be retrieved directly from parsing of coordinate-sorted BAM files, these files are very large and not suitable for transfer between collaborators. As such, an extra step is required to retrieve and compress coverage data as a separate file (traditionally, as BigWig files). Thus, we identified the parsing of alignment files and the storage/recall of coverage data as the two key areas that required performance optimization.</p>
      <p>In R, the <italic toggle="yes">htslib</italic> C library [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] (provided via the <italic toggle="yes">Rhtslib</italic> package) is the key developer tool for creating C or C++ − based functions (callable via R) to parse BAM files. Although multi-threaded BAM parsing is supported, downstream access of decompressed data is not thread safe (i.e. reads cannot be processed in a multi-threaded manner). Thus, computationally intensive downstream processing of alignments is not thread-scalable. To overcome this, we developed <italic toggle="yes">ompBAM,</italic> a novel C++ library (provided by the <italic toggle="yes">ompBAM</italic> R package available via <italic toggle="yes">Bioconductor</italic>). Using this resource, developers can create <italic toggle="yes">Rcpp</italic>-based functions to parse and analyse alignment BAM files using multiple threads. Unlike <italic toggle="yes">htslib</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ompBAM</italic> decompresses alignments which can be later accessed in a thread-safe manner. This allows computationally intensive functions to be thread scalable as downstream processing is no longer bottlenecked at a single thread. <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> uses <italic toggle="yes">ompBAM</italic> for all functions that require parsing of BAM files.</p>
      <p>To demonstrate the performance of <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>, we processed alignments from the simulated dataset using an incremental number of threads and showed that runtime decreased with increasing number of threads indicating thread-scalability (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref>, <xref rid="sup5" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A</xref>), with only modest increase in memory consumption (<xref rid="sup5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5B</xref>) thereby improving per-thread memory consumption (<xref rid="sup5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5C</xref>). Next, we benchmarked <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> against the BAM-processing step from a range of AS tools. Using the same number of threads, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> outperformed most of the other tools tested, except for <italic toggle="yes">IRFinder-S</italic> (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), (noting that <italic toggle="yes">IRFinder-S</italic> does not natively support multi-threading and was parallelized using <italic toggle="yes">BiocParallel</italic> via R). Importantly, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is orders of magnitude faster than other AS tools on R/Bioconductor (namely, <italic toggle="yes">ASpli</italic> [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], <italic toggle="yes">SGSeq</italic> [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">IntEREst</italic> [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]).</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="bbad468f6" position="float"/>
      </fig>
      <p>Next, we needed a fast method to store and recall stranded coverage data. As <italic toggle="yes">BigWig</italic> [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] (the current standard for storing coverage data) only supports storage of a single vector of data, each sample would require two <italic toggle="yes">BigWig</italic> files to store stranded coverage data. Thus, we designed a new COV format, which is a BGZF-compressed self-indexed format that stores coverage data for both positive, negative and unstranded data (see Supplementary Methods). Using two datasets, we demonstrate that the COV format shows storage efficiency gains over <italic toggle="yes">BigWig</italic> (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). COV file generation is thread-scalable, and at 4+ threads, it is faster than <italic toggle="yes">megadepth</italic> [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], the current fastest tool for generating <italic toggle="yes">BigWig</italic> files (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Importantly, in the default workflow for <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>, COV files are generated simultaneously with BAM parsing to quantify splice metrics, such that BAM files are processed only once (<xref rid="sup5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5D</xref>). Data recall using COV files is also faster than equivalent functions that use <italic toggle="yes">BigWig</italic> files. <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> retrieves binned-average coverage faster than R-based tools that utilize <italic toggle="yes">BigWig</italic>, namely, <italic toggle="yes">megadepth</italic> [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">rtracklayer</italic> [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). This increased performance is due to the greatly improved raw data retrieval time using <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz’s</italic> unique COV format (<xref rid="sup5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5E</xref>).</p>
      <p>Taken together, we successfully optimized the performance of <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>, focusing on alignment file parsing and coverage data storage and recall times. These improvements make <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> suitable for analysing large datasets and generating coverage plots in real time during interactive exploratory analyses.</p>

      <title>Scalability of <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> to large datasets</title>
      <p>The computational optimization in <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> allows scalability of R-based differential splicing analysis to large datasets. Additionally, for complex datasets with three or more experimental groups, users may wish to perform differential analysis multiple times to test splicing differences between each pair of groups. In both <italic toggle="yes">rMATS</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MAJIQ</italic>, performing each comparison requires the re-parsing of intermediate output files for every sample, leading to redundancies in computation. <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> addresses this via its collation step (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), whereby intermediate output files for each sample are parsed once, unified into count matrices, and compressed into output files along with an abridged version of the splicing reference. Differential analysis is performed by importing the collated dataset from file, rather than by parsing intermediate files of every sample. This design allows <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> datasets to be portable and easy to share among researchers.</p>
      <p>To demonstrate the scalability of <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> and the utility of its modular design to reduce the run time of the downstream differential AS analysis, we analysed 263 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) RNA-seq samples from the Leucegene dataset [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. For each of the tools (<italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">rMATS</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MAJIQ</italic>), we used a maximum of eight threads. Additionally, for <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MAJIQ</italic>, we restricted the available memory to 32 gigabytes. We benchmarked run times for each phase (processing of alignment BAM files, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> dataset collation and differential analysis between two groups) using the full dataset (263 samples). This benchmark showed that <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is the fastest tool for both processing of alignment files and subsequent differential analysis (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref rid="TB2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

      <p>Next, we wanted to compare the accuracy of differential analysis in a larger dataset. We assessed accuracy of differential splicing analysis using a simulated dataset based on a subset of the Leucegene dataset (10 acute promyelocytic leukemia samples and 10 randomly chosen AML controls). Accuracy metrics showed that <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> outperformed both <italic toggle="yes">rMATS</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MAJIQ</italic> (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B, C</xref>, <xref rid="TB2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>
      <p>Taken together, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> scales well to large datasets with respect to computational performance and accuracy. The modular design of <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> facilitates sharing of datasets among collaborators and increases the efficiency for users wishing to perform multiple comparisons in datasets with complex experimental designs.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>We demonstrated <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> as a versatile R package for AS analysis. Benchmarks against comparison tools show that <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is accurate and computationally efficient. Furthermore, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> implements a novel AS event-based coverage normalization to generate group coverage plots to accurately visualize differential splicing across conditions. Through the <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> GUI, we have also implemented an interactive visualization-based pipeline to enhance the user experience and assist in identifying functionally relevant ASEs for further study.</p>
    <p>There are many approaches to benchmarking AS tools to assess accuracy. A key aspect is the assumption of how PSI values are statistically distributed. Our assumption that PSI values are beta distributed is based on the intuition that during sequencing, reads are being randomly sampled from cDNA fragments derived from source RNA that belong to either ‘included’ or ‘excluded’ isoforms. Hence, our benchmarks naturally favour tools that make similar statistical assumptions, namely <italic toggle="yes">rMATS</italic> [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">SGSeq</italic> [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In contrast, benchmarks that showed <italic toggle="yes">SUPPA2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MAJIQ</italic> outperforming <italic toggle="yes">rMATS</italic> were performed based on error models applied to changes in PSI (ΔPSI) as a linear quantity [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Accordingly, <italic toggle="yes">SUPPA2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MAJIQ</italic> performed less favourably on our benchmarks. Importantly, focussing on PSI as a linear difference between two conditions result in the loss of information about the baseline PSI. When the baseline PSI is close to zero, changes in PSI (e.g. PSI from 0.01 to 0.03, or from 0.99 to 0.97) results in a higher fold-change in logit transformed PSI compared to examples where the baseline PSI is in the center of the [0,1] interval (e.g. PSI 0.49–&gt; 0.51). Thus, like <italic toggle="yes">rMATS</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">SGSeq, SpliceWiz’s</italic> statistical approach is sensitive in detecting ASEs with baseline PSIs close to 0 or 1, which in practice encompasses most ASEs in real datasets (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J, K</xref>).</p>
    <p>Prior studies have attempted to combine sample replicates into a single plot. <italic toggle="yes">ggsashimi</italic> [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] combines replicates by stacking traces of raw coverage, using different levels of transparency to show multiple histograms. This approach is limited in its ability to adjust for variances in sequencing depth and gene expressions between replicates, which vary independently of changes in PSI. <italic toggle="yes">Manananggal</italic> [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] implemented an exon-based visualization using a <italic toggle="yes">DEXSeq’s</italic> exon normalization backend, and more recently <italic toggle="yes">VALERIE</italic> [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] implemented an exon-based visualization used a PSI-based normalization which scales coverage based on sum included/excluded junction reads. These approaches are limited in their inability to visualize IR due to their exon-only approach.</p>
    <p>Our benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic> normalization metric estimates local transcript depth to accurately visualize IR. Moreover, group differences in normalized coverage across alternatively spliced regions accurately visualize differential splicing. Importantly, coverage plots are poor at identifying differential events at PSI close to 1. We surmise that this is because coverage plots are asymmetric in their quantitative representation of included and excluded isoforms. Included isoforms are represented by coverage, whereas excluded isoforms are represented only using numbered arcs in sashimi plots. At a PSI close to one, fold change signals in the isoforms are represented as loss of coverage and is hidden among the noise of coverage variances of the included isoform. This finding uncovers a general weakness of coverage plots, which is unrelated to our normalization approach. Naturally, as most IR events have a PSI close to zero whereas other types of ASEs have a bimodal distribution of PSIs around the 0 and 1 boundaries, coverage plots most accurately visualize IR. Nevertheless, coverage plots remain a useful visualization of AS due to its representation of the raw alignment data underpinning splicing quantitation. As larger RNA sequencing datasets become more available, the prior approach of representing a sample group using duplicate/triplicate samples will be replaced by <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz’s</italic> approach of representing the entire group via normalized coverage. Thus, normalized coverage plots will become the new standard for AS visualization.</p>
    <p>The <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> GUI provides an interactive platform allowing users to explore the results of differential ASE analysis. This platform is designed to highlight interesting and relevant ASEs for further investigation. The choice of ASEs to experimentally verify typically depends on several factors, including the reliability of the measurements and the relevance of affected genes to the functional pathways of interest. Measurement reliability can be visually surveyed using <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz’s</italic> normalized coverage plots. Moreover, GO enrichment analysis and GO-based heatmaps facilitate the identification of functionally relevant ASEs. These tools represent a considerable improvement over current methods, which typically provide tabular lists of the top differential results without companion tools or capabilities for functional annotation. Taken together, the interactivity in exploring the differential analysis results improves the user experience and the efficacy in identifying functionally relevant ‘top hits’ for experimental validation.</p>
    <p>Computational performance is a key aspect to the user experience of any bioinformatics tool. We optimized <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> to process BAM files orders of magnitude faster than other Bioconductor tools for AS analysis, and on par with command-line tools. Moreover, coverage data stored in <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz’s COV</italic> format is more efficient than <italic toggle="yes">BigWig</italic>, which facilitates data transfer between collaborators. These optimizations encourage researchers to analyse AS alongside gene expression, and provide biologists and bioinformaticians with the same platform, thereby enhancing collaboration and communication.</p>
    <p>AS databases, whereby AS quantitation has been performed on large RNA-seq datasets in advance, are in growing demand. Recently, numerous AS databases have been published, covering various biological systems including diverse human and murine tissues [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], cancers [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36–38</xref>] and COVID-19 [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> provides an ideal platform to create AS databases due to its ability to uniformly analyse and package data from large datasets. <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>-generated AS databases are superior in that it can be used in conjunction with coverage data (via COV files) to visualize differential AS between customizable sample groups. This feature would add to the level of granularity that is required to identify the most meaningful AS events and examine them in the appropriate context. We anticipate that <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> will become the preferred platform for publishing AS database resources going forward.</p>
    <p>Although <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is primarily designed for bulk RNA-seq datasets, alignments from individual or clusters of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can theoretically be analysed using <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>. However, like most AS tools designed for bulk RNA-seq, their use in parsing scRNA-seq is limited by their reliance on full-transcriptome protocols. As most scRNA-seq datasets use 3′-based sequencing, most AS events cannot be properly analysed or visualized. Another limitation of <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is its inability to correct for technical confounders of sequencing coverage (such as GC and 5′/3′ bias) in its coverage visualization, as <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> only uses a single normalization factor per sample for each ASE. Although batch-correction is a feature implemented in <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> via its GLM-based differential analysis, batch correction cannot be factored into its coverage normalization algorithm.</p>
    <p>In summary, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is a fast, accessible and user-friendly interactive tool for AS analysis, and sets a new standard in splicing visualization via group normalized coverage plots.</p>

      <title>Quantifying percent-spliced-in</title>
      <p>ASEs, including annotated IR events, are quantified in <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> using PSI, which is calculated using equation (<xref rid="deqn02" ref-type="disp-formula">2</xref>). ASE isoforms are designated by the size of the alternately spliced region, which is defined to be larger in the included isoform compared with the excluded isoform. For events where alternatively spliced regions are mutually exclusive (namely MXE, AFE and ALE), the included isoform is defined as that which contains the shorter first intron. For details on annotation of ASEs, see Supplementary Methods and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>: </p>

      <p>Included and excluded isoform abundances are estimated based on counts of junction reads, noting that such reads do not require length normalization unlike expression estimation using reads aligned to exon bodies. The exception is the included isoform in IR events (i.e. the retained intron), whereby we followed the approach of <italic toggle="yes">IRFinder</italic> [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] in using the (30% trimmed) mean depth of coverage across the measured intron. For isoforms that encompass two (tandem) splice junctions (i.e. included cassette exons or mutually exclusive exons), isoform abundances were estimated using mean counts of the two junctions.</p>

      <title>Differential ASE analysis using established statistical tools in R</title>
      <p>Functions for performing GLM-based differential ASE analysis were implemented using wrapper functions to established statistical methods <italic toggle="yes">limma</italic> [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], <italic toggle="yes">DESeq2</italic> [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">edgeR</italic> [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These were implemented as follows: At the data collation step, two matrices are compiled, each containing estimated included and excluded isoform abundances. Columns in these matrices represent samples whereas rows represent ASEs. During differential expression analysis, two separate analyses are performed. First, differential analysis is performed separately on each of library-normalized included and excluded counts. Assuming a contrasting condition ‘Treatment’ and a batch factor condition ‘Batch’, the model is described in equation (<xref rid="deqn03" ref-type="disp-formula">3</xref>), where the last term is the contrasting term. This step provides information on whether the change in AS is due to changes in either included or excluded isoform abundances, or both: </p>

      </disp-formula>
      <p>Subsequently, the two matrices (of raw counts) are concatenated column-wise, and an extra ‘ASE’ condition is added to the column (sample) annotations which specifies whether each column represents included or excluded isoforms. Differential ASE analysis is performed using a GLM model as described in equation (<xref rid="deqn04" ref-type="disp-formula">4</xref>), where again the last term is the contrasting term.

      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Alternative splicing (AS) is a crucial mechanism for regulating gene expression and isoform diversity in eukaryotes. However, the analysis and visualization of AS events from RNA sequencing data remains challenging. Most tools require a certain level of computer literacy and the available means of visualizing AS events, such as coverage and sashimi plots, have limitations and can be misleading. To address these issues, we present <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>, an R package with an interactive Shiny interface that allows easy and efficient AS analysis and visualization at scale. A novel normalization algorithm is implemented to aggregate splicing levels within sample groups, thereby allowing group differences in splicing levels to be accurately visualized. The tool also offers downstream gene ontology enrichment analysis, highlighting ASEs belonging to functional pathways of interest. <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is optimized for speed and efficiency and introduces a new file format for coverage data storage that is more efficient than BigWig. Alignment files are processed orders of magnitude faster than other R-based AS analysis tools and on par with command-line tools. Overall, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> streamlines AS analysis, enabling reliable identification of functionally relevant AS events for further characterization. <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is a Bioconductor package and is also available on GitHub (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/alexchwong/SpliceWiz" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/alexchwong/SpliceWiz</ext-link>).</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Alternative splicing (AS) is a regulated process whereby alternate blocks of protein coding information, exons, are selectively transferred during or after transcription of messenger RNA from DNA. Introns, sequences interspersed between exons, are removed by the spliceosome at their donor (5′) and acceptor (3′) splice sites. AS arises consequent to enhanced or inhibited recognition of splice sites [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], leading to selective retention or removal of extra genetic information during or after transcription. Although AS can be complex, at its essence, there are seven basic forms [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], namely inclusion/skipping of cassette exons (skipped exons, SE), inclusion of mutually exclusive exons (MXE), alternative 5′/3′ splice site usage (A5SS/A3SS), alternative first or last exons (AFE/ALE) and intron retention (IR) (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>). These alternative splicing events (ASEs) are defined as a binary choice between ‘inclusion’ or ‘exclusion’ of the alternate exon, partial exon or intron. ASEs can be quantified using RNA sequencing reads aligned across alternate splice sites (hereafter junction reads) [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and are visualized using coverage or sashimi plots [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. AS allows a single gene to give rise to multiple messenger RNA transcripts from the same DNA template, which in turn can translate different proteins [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Additionally, retained introns can affect transcript localization and degradation, leading to altered expression [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
    <p>Despite the ready availability of RNA sequencing, including a vast volume of publicly available datasets, AS analysis is not routinely performed. Most tools for AS analysis are command-line based, hindering their accessibility to those not familiar with such interfaces. Coverage and sashimi plot visualization is limited by the lack of methods to normalize coverage at genomic regions of ASEs. If such methods existed, differential splicing between conditions could be visualized using mean normalized coverage of replicates within each condition. Individual samples from each condition with large differences in coverage can often be found even in ASEs with no significant differential splicing between conditions. Thus, the current practice of selecting ‘representative individual samples’ is flawed and leads to publication bias. Finally, data interactivity is lacking in current tools, particularly downstream to differential splicing analysis. Interactive data exploration tools would facilitate the process of identifying functionally relevant ASEs for further study.</p>
    <p>To address the above limitations, we created <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>, an AS analysis and visualization tool. <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is implemented as an R package and provides both graphical and command-line user interfaces. Starting from input bulk RNA sequencing alignment files (BAM files), <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> quantifies AS using junction reads and intronic coverage, leveraging novel junction reads to detect cryptic splice sites and exons. Differential analysis is performed using established statistical tools available in R, allowing generalized linear model (GLM) based analysis to accommodate large complex datasets. We propose a coverage normalization method to visualize IR ratios, and show that this approach accurately visualizes differential AS. A variety of interactive visualization tools are implemented, including gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, to facilitate identification of reliable candidate ASEs relevant to the observed biological phenomena. Finally, to improve computational performance we optimized storage and retrieval of sequencing coverage using a new file format, implemented alongside multi-threaded parsing of alignment files. Taken together, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is an accessible, user-friendly and computationally efficient application that streamlines AS analysis, focussing on reliably identifying functionally relevant ASEs for further characterization.</p>

      <title>The <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> pipeline</title>
      <p>We implemented <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> as an R package, with both a command-line and graphical interface, the latter implemented via <italic toggle="yes">shinyDashboard</italic>. We organized the <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> pipeline in a modular format, as follows (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>):</p>

          <p>The SpliceWiz pipeline is organized into four modules. ‘Reference’ creates the SpliceWiz alternative splicing annotations required for processing alignments. ‘Experiment’ contains functions to process alignment files and collate their outputs into a dataset. ‘Analyse’ imports this dataset, allowing users to review quality control metrics and perform pre-test filtering of lowly-represented ASEs, and performs differential analysis to generate a table of results. ‘Display’ provides visualization tools, including volcano and scatter plots, gene ontology enrichment analysis, heatmaps and coverage plots.</p>

      <title>Differential analysis</title>
      <p>We implemented a GLM-based approach to differential ASE analysis to accommodate large datasets with complex experimental designs, including time series analysis, and accounting for batch effects. Many established statistical methods using GLMs already exist for gene expression analysis, the most cited being <italic toggle="yes">limma</italic> [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], <italic toggle="yes">DESeq2</italic> [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">edgeR</italic> [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For GLM-based differential AS analysis, we implemented wrapper functions in <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> to utilize each of these statistical tools (see Methods). We also implemented a wrapper function for <italic toggle="yes">DoubleExpSeq</italic> [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], a fast statistical method in R for differential AS analysis using simple contrasts between two conditions (see Methods).</p>
      <p>To assess the accuracy of these algorithms at identifying differential ASEs, we simulated reads to emulate transcript expression and technical parameters derived from a real RNA-seq dataset (THP-1 monocyte to macrophage differentiation [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]) using RSEM [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We used the percent-spliced-in (PSI) metric to quantify AS, which is determined based on known transcript expression values (see Methods). From these PSI values, a set of ground truth differential events were defined by modelling PSIs using a beta distribution (see Supplementary Methods). Accuracy was measured using two parameters: (i) to assess a method’s ability to accurately detect and appropriately rank the full set of differential events, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values were calculated for each method. (ii) To assess precision of the top ranked events in the analysis, we calculated the proportion of ground truth events that overlap with the top K predicted differential events, where K is the number of ground truth differential events in the simulation (hereafter Top-K accuracy).</p>
      <p>We first compared the performance of each statistical wrapper implemented in <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> (<xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We found that <italic toggle="yes">DESeq2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">edgeR</italic> were the top performers, with <italic toggle="yes">DESeq2</italic> marginally better than <italic toggle="yes">edgeR</italic> in both AUROC and Top-K accuracy (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Among the remaining methods, <italic toggle="yes">DoubleExpSeq</italic> performed better than <italic toggle="yes">limma</italic>. We also benchmarked the run-time of each method (in analysing the simulation with an input query of 148 633 ASEs for two conditions each with three replicates) and found that <italic toggle="yes">limma</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">DoubleExpSeq</italic> were the fastest methods, whereas <italic toggle="yes">DESeq2</italic> was the slowest (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). From this, we concluded that each method serves different purposes. The <italic toggle="yes">limma</italic> wrapper is a useful screening tool in an initial analysis for hypothesis generation. The fast compute time of the <italic toggle="yes">limma</italic> wrapper is especially helpful in large complex datasets where exploratory analysis is performed to identify parameters of interest and identify putative batch factors. The <italic toggle="yes">DoubleExpSeq</italic> wrapper is a general-purpose fast algorithm for simple contrasts between two conditions in a univariate setting. For analyses where an accurate set of top differential ASEs is the highest priority, <italic toggle="yes">edgeR</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">DESeq2</italic> are equivalent options.</p>

      <p>Next, we compared <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> (using the <italic toggle="yes">DESeq2</italic> wrapper) against other differential AS analysis tools, namely <italic toggle="yes">rMATS</italic> [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], <italic toggle="yes">SUPPA2</italic> [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], <italic toggle="yes">MAJIQ</italic> [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], <italic toggle="yes">SGSeq</italic> [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">SplAdder</italic> [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]<italic toggle="yes">.</italic> We chose these tools as they also use the PSI metric. As each method annotates ASEs differently, we calculated AUROC and top-K accuracy values using ASEs commonly annotated by all methods (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D</xref>, <xref rid="sup2" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A</xref>). This benchmark identified <italic toggle="yes">SGSeq</italic> as the best performer followed closely by <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>.

      <p>Taken together, we conclude that our implementation of GLM-based differential splicing performs well compared with other tools that perform differential AS analysis based on PSI values.</p>

      <title>Coverage plot normalization for intron retention</title>
      <p>Current implementations of coverage and sashimi plots are limited in showing coverage of individual samples, rather than mean coverage across replicates of each experimental condition. Combining data from replicates requires a normalization parameter. As replicates differ by both sequencing depth and gene expression, a sample-specific normalization factor is required for each gene. Moreover, variations in depth of coverage due to GC-bias and 3′- (or 5′-) bias mean that, even within the same gene, different normalization factors may be required across each genomic region.</p>
      <p>However, unlike in <italic toggle="yes">DEXSeq</italic> [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] where a statistical model is used to fit every exon, we sought a method to calculate a single normalization parameter for each ASE, which may overlap across multiple exons and introns. After normalization, the mean coverage across alternate regions should reflect their calculated PSIs, whereas coverage across constitutive regions (i.e. regions expressed by both included and excluded isoforms) should be normalized to unity. Within-group coverage means and variances can then be visualized as lines and shaded ribbons, respectively. Differences in normalized coverage can be statistically tested (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

      <p>First, we approached the case of IR and considered the simple scenario where the expressed isoform either involves splicing or retention of the intron of interest (i.e. only transcripts [RI, A] are expressed—see <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). In this case, coverage normalization should result in the exon boundaries to be anchored to unity and the average coverage across the intron should reflect the IR-ratio, as given by equation (<xref rid="deqn01" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>):</p>

      <p>In <italic toggle="yes">IRFinder</italic> [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], intronic abundance is measured using the trimmed mean of intronic coverage of sequencing reads (hereafter <italic toggle="yes">IntronDepth</italic>), which we adopted in <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>. For introns flanked by constitutively spliced exons, the read counts mapping to the splice junction across the intron of interest (hereafter <italic toggle="yes">SpliceExact</italic>) approximates spliced isoform abundance. However, in many cases, at least one exon flanking the intron of interest is also differentially spliced (e.g. due to expression of transcripts [B, C, D, E, F]—<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). To account for this, <italic toggle="yes">IRFinder</italic> estimates spliced isoform abundance using the <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic> metric [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which is calculated as follows: junction reads utilizing each of the splice junctions flanking the intron of interest are first calculated; <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic> is then determined as the larger of these two values (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). In the example illustrated in <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3(B)</xref>, the SpliceMax metric accounts for total splicing where one of the transcripts [A, B, C, D] is the major isoform.</p>
      <p>However, we observed that over-estimation of IR-ratios arises in cases where neither splice site bounding the intron of interest is shared with that of the major isoform (e.g. due to expression of transcripts [E,F] in <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). We encompassed these cases by proposing the <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic> metric which we define as follows: First, we use the transcriptome annotations to determine exon groups which are genomic regions occupied by mutually overlapping exons. Then, for the intron of interest, we quantified all splice sites that arise from the two exon groups flanking the intron of interest, rather than simply utilizing the flanking splice junction coordinates. <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic> is then determined as the larger of these two values.</p>
      <p>We hypothesized that transcript abundance (the denominator value of the IR-ratio) is best estimated using the sum of <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic> + <italic toggle="yes">IntronDepth</italic>. We compared this method against that using <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic> + <italic toggle="yes">IntronDepth</italic> which is the denominator value in calculating IR-ratios in <italic toggle="yes">IRFinder</italic> [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Using the simulated RNA-seq dataset based on THP-1 differentiation, we determined ground truth IR-ratios using known transcript abundances (see Supplementary Methods). First, we show we could reproduce <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic>-based IR-ratios in <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> by comparing these with values produced by <italic toggle="yes">IRFinder-S</italic> [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] (<xref rid="sup3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3A</xref>). Next, we compared IR-ratios derived from either <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic> against ground truth. Using replicate 1 from the THP1-M0 macrophage (simulated) sample as an example, using <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic> to estimate spliced isoform abundance resulted in less events with IR-ratio error (absolute difference between predicted and actual IR-ratios) is greater than 0.2, compared with <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic> (1.43% versus 3.56%, <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C,D</xref>). We attributed this to the overestimation (IR-ratio error &gt; 0.2) of <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic> in 1.69% of introns compared with <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic> (<xref rid="sup3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3B</xref>). Consequently, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic>, as a metric for spliced isoform abundance, more accurately estimates IR-ratios compared to <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic> (IR-ratio accuracy area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 98.73 versus 98.21, <xref rid="sup3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3C</xref>). We repeated this analysis on all samples in the simulation and found similar results (<xref rid="sup3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3D, E</xref>). Moreover, based on the simulated dataset, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz’s SpliceOver</italic> metric outperformed <italic toggle="yes">S-IRFinder</italic> in detecting differential IR events (<xref rid="sup3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3F</xref>).</p>
      <p>If transcript abundance is used as the normalization parameter for coverage, then the mean normalized coverage across introns is equivalent to their IR-ratios. Thus, we compared mean normalized coverage with their ground truth IR-ratios, using <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic> as estimates of spliced isoform abundance. We found that <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic>-based normalization outperformed <italic toggle="yes">SpliceMax</italic> at normalizing coverages (2.07 and 4.33% of introns where IR-ratios inferred from mean coverage was outside 0.2 difference with ground truth (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E, F</xref>), resulting in higher accuracy (IR-ratio error AUC 98.41 and 97.85, respectively, <xref rid="sup3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3G</xref>).</p>
      <p>Taken together, we implemented coverage normalization using a normalization parameter based on transcript depth across the intron of interest, whereby splicing abundance is measured using the <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic> metric as described above. Using this approach, normalized coverage across introns accurately reflects their IR-ratios.</p>

      <title>Differences in coverage across alternately spliced regions demonstrate differential splicing</title>
      <p>Having shown that our normalization approach results in mean normalized coverage across introns representing IR-ratios, we examined whether differences in normalized coverage can be used to demonstrate differential splicing between groups of samples. To measure differences in normalized coverages between two groups of replicates, we used a two-tailed Student’s <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test on normalized coverage (examples in <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4AC</xref>). After <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values were computed for each nucleotide, we calculated the mean of negative log-10 transformed <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values across each alternately spliced region (excluding five boundary nucleotides at each end). We performed this assessment for IR, cassette/ SE and alternate 5′/3′ splice site (A5SS/A3SS) events, whereby the alternatively spliced regions are the introns, SE and the regions between the two alternate splice sites, respectively. We excluded MXE, AFE and ALE events from the analysis as these types of events involve inclusion of two mutually exclusive exons. We also removed from the analysis A5SS/A3SS events where the two alternative splice sites were separated by an intron belonging to an interfering annotated transcript. We evaluated the mean negative log-10 transformed <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values from the Student’s <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test (hereafter referred to as the T-score) as a discriminator to detect differential events.</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="bbad468f4" position="float"/>
      </fig>
      <p>We first benchmarked this approach using our simulated dataset, using all ground truth differential ASEs (with ΔPSI &gt;0.05) and nine times as many randomly chosen non-differential ASEs, such that there are 10% differential events. We found that the T-score performed well and was best for IR, followed by SE and then A5SS/A3SS (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Importantly, we found this test was superior for events in which the mean PSI was low (i.e. the alternately spliced region is predominantly excluded across all samples) than those in which the mean PSI was high (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E–G</xref>). Interestingly, when we controlled for PSI by subsetting events using the criterion PSI &lt; 0.1 (<xref rid="sup4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4A, B</xref>), there were only negligible differences in accuracy pertaining to different types of ASE (<xref rid="sup4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4C</xref>). This suggests that the PSI is the major determinant of accuracy when using coverage to visualize differential splicing.</p>
      <p>Next, we benchmarked this approach using two real datasets. We chose the THP-1 monocyte to M0-macrophage differentiation by Green <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> ([<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], GSE130011) as an example of deep RNA sequencing (~100 million 150-nt paired end reads per sample) and the dual TRA2A/TRA2B knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells by Best <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> ([<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], GSE59335) as an example RNA sequencing dataset of a more typical depth (~25 million 100-nt paired end reads per sample). As ground truth differential ASEs cannot be experimentally determined transcriptome-wide, we instead used <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> to perform edgeR-based differential AS analysis as comparison. Events with a false-discovery rate FDR &lt; 0.05 and ΔPSI &gt;0.05 were considered differential ASEs.</p>
      <p>First, we addressed whether <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>-based reanalysis could replicate prior findings. The Green <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> dataset is known to contain many IR events downregulated in monocyte–macrophage transition [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], whereas the Best <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> dataset shows widespread SE in dual TRA2A/TRA2B knockdown [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Reanalysis of the Green <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> dataset identified 866 and 129 down-regulated and upregulated IR events, respectively, during monocyte–macrophage differentiation. In the Best <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> dataset, 821 and 80 differentially skipped and included exons, respectively, due to dual TRA2A/TRA2B knockdown were identified. Thus, in both datasets, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> reanalysis confirmed prior findings.</p>
      <p>Next, we measured the accuracy of <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz’s</italic> coverage plots. Again, we benchmarked IR, SE, and A5SS/A3SS differential ASEs and randomly chosen non-differential ASEs such that there are 10% true positive differential events. We observed similar findings, specifically, that the test was more useful for IR than for other types of ASEs (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H, I</xref>), and that this approach was more accurate at low PSI (<xref rid="sup4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4D–H</xref>). From this, we concluded that the difference in the performance of coverage plot-based differential splicing visualization between types of AS is largely due to the distribution of PSIs for each type of ASE, (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J, K</xref>). Furthermore, using down-sampling of reads in the THP-1 (Green <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.) dataset, we showed that lower sequencing depth led to lower accuracy (<xref rid="sup4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4I–K</xref>), which could explain the slightly better accuracy in the Green <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> dataset compared with the Best <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> dataset.</p>
      <p>Taken together, we conclude that group-mean coverage plots are most accurate at demonstrating differential IR but are also useful for demonstrating other forms of AS. Importantly, coverage plots are more accurate at visualizing differential splicing where alternatively spliced regions are predominantly excluded (i.e. at low PSI).</p>

      <title>Interactive exploration of differential analysis</title>
      <p>Without tools to interact with the results of differential analysis, identifying top functionally relevant candidates for experimental validation is a manual process that is cumbersome and inefficient. To streamline exploratory analysis downstream to differential analysis, we implemented a series of interactive visualization tools that allow users to identify a set of relevant ASEs following differential analysis.</p>
      <p>As a case study, we use M1 macrophage differentiation from naïve M0 macrophages to illustrate the features (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). After differential ASE analysis was performed in contrasting samples from M0 and M1 macrophage differentiation, top differential events can be visualized using interactive volcano plots (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B, C</xref>) or by scatter plots (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Using the mouse, users can highlight ASEs on either plot using box or lasso select tools. In our example, selecting the top events in the volcano plot (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) leads to highlighting of the same events in the split volcano plot (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>) and scatter plot (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Following this, highlighted ASEs can be used to perform GO enrichment analysis (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>), using as background either the entire set of genes from the annotation, or genes hosting one or more ASEs. Heatmaps can be generated either from top differential ASEs by significance, user-selected ASEs, or ASEs from a GO term (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F, G</xref>). From the heatmap, users can identify ASEs of interest and visualize these as coverage plots (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H, I, J</xref>).</p>

      <p>Thus, interactive data exploration downstream to differential analysis is a core feature of <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>, in contrast to currently available tools. Identifying the top functionally relevant ASEs for experimental validation and further study is a key crossroad in any study involving high-throughput AS analysis. Our GUI-based implementation streamlines this process and helps researchers pick the best candidate ASEs without requiring external tools or manual annotation.</p>

      <title>Performance optimization in SpliceWiz</title>
      <p>Apart from alignment of raw sequencing reads, the processing of alignment BAM files is the most time-consuming step of AS analysis pipelines. In <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>, BAM files are parsed to count reads aligned across splice junctions, calculate coverage depth across introns, and record coverage for generating coverage plots. Although coverage can be retrieved directly from parsing of coordinate-sorted BAM files, these files are very large and not suitable for transfer between collaborators. As such, an extra step is required to retrieve and compress coverage data as a separate file (traditionally, as BigWig files). Thus, we identified the parsing of alignment files and the storage/recall of coverage data as the two key areas that required performance optimization.</p>
      <p>In R, the <italic toggle="yes">htslib</italic> C library [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] (provided via the <italic toggle="yes">Rhtslib</italic> package) is the key developer tool for creating C or C++ − based functions (callable via R) to parse BAM files. Although multi-threaded BAM parsing is supported, downstream access of decompressed data is not thread safe (i.e. reads cannot be processed in a multi-threaded manner). Thus, computationally intensive downstream processing of alignments is not thread-scalable. To overcome this, we developed <italic toggle="yes">ompBAM,</italic> a novel C++ library (provided by the <italic toggle="yes">ompBAM</italic> R package available via <italic toggle="yes">Bioconductor</italic>). Using this resource, developers can create <italic toggle="yes">Rcpp</italic>-based functions to parse and analyse alignment BAM files using multiple threads. Unlike <italic toggle="yes">htslib</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ompBAM</italic> decompresses alignments which can be later accessed in a thread-safe manner. This allows computationally intensive functions to be thread scalable as downstream processing is no longer bottlenecked at a single thread. <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> uses <italic toggle="yes">ompBAM</italic> for all functions that require parsing of BAM files.</p>
      <p>To demonstrate the performance of <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>, we processed alignments from the simulated dataset using an incremental number of threads and showed that runtime decreased with increasing number of threads indicating thread-scalability (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref>, <xref rid="sup5" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A</xref>), with only modest increase in memory consumption (<xref rid="sup5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5B</xref>) thereby improving per-thread memory consumption (<xref rid="sup5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5C</xref>). Next, we benchmarked <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> against the BAM-processing step from a range of AS tools. Using the same number of threads, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> outperformed most of the other tools tested, except for <italic toggle="yes">IRFinder-S</italic> (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), (noting that <italic toggle="yes">IRFinder-S</italic> does not natively support multi-threading and was parallelized using <italic toggle="yes">BiocParallel</italic> via R). Importantly, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is orders of magnitude faster than other AS tools on R/Bioconductor (namely, <italic toggle="yes">ASpli</italic> [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], <italic toggle="yes">SGSeq</italic> [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">IntEREst</italic> [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]).</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="bbad468f6" position="float"/>
      </fig>
      <p>Next, we needed a fast method to store and recall stranded coverage data. As <italic toggle="yes">BigWig</italic> [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] (the current standard for storing coverage data) only supports storage of a single vector of data, each sample would require two <italic toggle="yes">BigWig</italic> files to store stranded coverage data. Thus, we designed a new COV format, which is a BGZF-compressed self-indexed format that stores coverage data for both positive, negative and unstranded data (see Supplementary Methods). Using two datasets, we demonstrate that the COV format shows storage efficiency gains over <italic toggle="yes">BigWig</italic> (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). COV file generation is thread-scalable, and at 4+ threads, it is faster than <italic toggle="yes">megadepth</italic> [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], the current fastest tool for generating <italic toggle="yes">BigWig</italic> files (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Importantly, in the default workflow for <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>, COV files are generated simultaneously with BAM parsing to quantify splice metrics, such that BAM files are processed only once (<xref rid="sup5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5D</xref>). Data recall using COV files is also faster than equivalent functions that use <italic toggle="yes">BigWig</italic> files. <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> retrieves binned-average coverage faster than R-based tools that utilize <italic toggle="yes">BigWig</italic>, namely, <italic toggle="yes">megadepth</italic> [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">rtracklayer</italic> [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). This increased performance is due to the greatly improved raw data retrieval time using <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz’s</italic> unique COV format (<xref rid="sup5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5E</xref>).</p>
      <p>Taken together, we successfully optimized the performance of <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>, focusing on alignment file parsing and coverage data storage and recall times. These improvements make <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> suitable for analysing large datasets and generating coverage plots in real time during interactive exploratory analyses.</p>

      <title>Scalability of <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> to large datasets</title>
      <p>The computational optimization in <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> allows scalability of R-based differential splicing analysis to large datasets. Additionally, for complex datasets with three or more experimental groups, users may wish to perform differential analysis multiple times to test splicing differences between each pair of groups. In both <italic toggle="yes">rMATS</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MAJIQ</italic>, performing each comparison requires the re-parsing of intermediate output files for every sample, leading to redundancies in computation. <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> addresses this via its collation step (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), whereby intermediate output files for each sample are parsed once, unified into count matrices, and compressed into output files along with an abridged version of the splicing reference. Differential analysis is performed by importing the collated dataset from file, rather than by parsing intermediate files of every sample. This design allows <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> datasets to be portable and easy to share among researchers.</p>
      <p>To demonstrate the scalability of <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> and the utility of its modular design to reduce the run time of the downstream differential AS analysis, we analysed 263 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) RNA-seq samples from the Leucegene dataset [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. For each of the tools (<italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">rMATS</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MAJIQ</italic>), we used a maximum of eight threads. Additionally, for <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MAJIQ</italic>, we restricted the available memory to 32 gigabytes. We benchmarked run times for each phase (processing of alignment BAM files, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> dataset collation and differential analysis between two groups) using the full dataset (263 samples). This benchmark showed that <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is the fastest tool for both processing of alignment files and subsequent differential analysis (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref rid="TB2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Even when taking to account the extra step of dataset collation, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> remains the fastest tool.</p>

      <p>Next, we wanted to compare the accuracy of differential analysis in a larger dataset.

  <sec id="sec12">
    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>We demonstrated <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> as a versatile R package for AS analysis. Benchmarks against comparison tools show that <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is accurate and computationally efficient. Furthermore, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> implements a novel AS event-based coverage normalization to generate group coverage plots to accurately visualize differential splicing across conditions. Through the <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> GUI, we have also implemented an interactive visualization-based pipeline to enhance the user experience and assist in identifying functionally relevant ASEs for further study.</p>
    <p>There are many approaches to benchmarking AS tools to assess accuracy. A key aspect is the assumption of how PSI values are statistically distributed. Our assumption that PSI values are beta distributed is based on the intuition that during sequencing, reads are being randomly sampled from cDNA fragments derived from source RNA that belong to either ‘included’ or ‘excluded’ isoforms. Hence, our benchmarks naturally favour tools that make similar statistical assumptions, namely <italic toggle="yes">rMATS</italic> [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">SGSeq</italic> [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In contrast, benchmarks that showed <italic toggle="yes">SUPPA2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MAJIQ</italic> outperforming <italic toggle="yes">rMATS</italic> were performed based on error models applied to changes in PSI (ΔPSI) as a linear quantity [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Accordingly, <italic toggle="yes">SUPPA2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MAJIQ</italic> performed less favourably on our benchmarks. Importantly, focussing on PSI as a linear difference between two conditions result in the loss of information about the baseline PSI. When the baseline PSI is close to zero, changes in PSI (e.g. PSI from 0.01 to 0.03, or from 0.99 to 0.97) results in a higher fold-change in logit transformed PSI compared to examples where the baseline PSI is in the center of the [0,1] interval (e.g. PSI 0.49–&gt; 0.51). Thus, like <italic toggle="yes">rMATS</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">SGSeq, SpliceWiz’s</italic> statistical approach is sensitive in detecting ASEs with baseline PSIs close to 0 or 1, which in practice encompasses most ASEs in real datasets (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J, K</xref>).</p>
    <p>Prior studies have attempted to combine sample replicates into a single plot. <italic toggle="yes">ggsashimi</italic> [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] combines replicates by stacking traces of raw coverage, using different levels of transparency to show multiple histograms. This approach is limited in its ability to adjust for variances in sequencing depth and gene expressions between replicates, which vary independently of changes in PSI. <italic toggle="yes">Manananggal</italic> [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] implemented an exon-based visualization using a <italic toggle="yes">DEXSeq’s</italic> exon normalization backend, and more recently <italic toggle="yes">VALERIE</italic> [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] implemented an exon-based visualization used a PSI-based normalization which scales coverage based on sum included/excluded junction reads. These approaches are limited in their inability to visualize IR due to their exon-only approach.</p>
    <p>Our benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed <italic toggle="yes">SpliceOver</italic> normalization metric estimates local transcript depth to accurately visualize IR. Moreover, group differences in normalized coverage across alternatively spliced regions accurately visualize differential splicing. Importantly, coverage plots are poor at identifying differential events at PSI close to 1. We surmise that this is because coverage plots are asymmetric in their quantitative representation of included and excluded isoforms. Included isoforms are represented by coverage, whereas excluded isoforms are represented only using numbered arcs in sashimi plots. At a PSI close to one, fold change signals in the isoforms are represented as loss of coverage and is hidden among the noise of coverage variances of the included isoform. This finding uncovers a general weakness of coverage plots, which is unrelated to our normalization approach. Naturally, as most IR events have a PSI close to zero whereas other types of ASEs have a bimodal distribution of PSIs around the 0 and 1 boundaries, coverage plots most accurately visualize IR. Nevertheless, coverage plots remain a useful visualization of AS due to its representation of the raw alignment data underpinning splicing quantitation. As larger RNA sequencing datasets become more available, the prior approach of representing a sample group using duplicate/triplicate samples will be replaced by <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz’s</italic> approach of representing the entire group via normalized coverage. Thus, normalized coverage plots will become the new standard for AS visualization.</p>
    <p>The <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> GUI provides an interactive platform allowing users to explore the results of differential ASE analysis. This platform is designed to highlight interesting and relevant ASEs for further investigation. The choice of ASEs to experimentally verify typically depends on several factors, including the reliability of the measurements and the relevance of affected genes to the functional pathways of interest. Measurement reliability can be visually surveyed using <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz’s</italic> normalized coverage plots. Moreover, GO enrichment analysis and GO-based heatmaps facilitate the identification of functionally relevant ASEs. These tools represent a considerable improvement over current methods, which typically provide tabular lists of the top differential results without companion tools or capabilities for functional annotation. Taken together, the interactivity in exploring the differential analysis results improves the user experience and the efficacy in identifying functionally relevant ‘top hits’ for experimental validation.</p>
    <p>Computational performance is a key aspect to the user experience of any bioinformatics tool. We optimized <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> to process BAM files orders of magnitude faster than other Bioconductor tools for AS analysis, and on par with command-line tools. Moreover, coverage data stored in <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz’s COV</italic> format is more efficient than <italic toggle="yes">BigWig</italic>, which facilitates data transfer between collaborators. These optimizations encourage researchers to analyse AS alongside gene expression, and provide biologists and bioinformaticians with the same platform, thereby enhancing collaboration and communication.</p>
    <p>AS databases, whereby AS quantitation has been performed on large RNA-seq datasets in advance, are in growing demand. Recently, numerous AS databases have been published, covering various biological systems including diverse human and murine tissues [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], cancers [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36–38</xref>] and COVID-19 [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> provides an ideal platform to create AS databases due to its ability to uniformly analyse and package data from large datasets. <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>-generated AS databases are superior in that it can be used in conjunction with coverage data (via COV files) to visualize differential AS between customizable sample groups. This feature would add to the level of granularity that is required to identify the most meaningful AS events and examine them in the appropriate context. We anticipate that <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> will become the preferred platform for publishing AS database resources going forward.</p>
    <p>Although <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is primarily designed for bulk RNA-seq datasets, alignments from individual or clusters of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can theoretically be analysed using <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic>. However, like most AS tools designed for bulk RNA-seq, their use in parsing scRNA-seq is limited by their reliance on full-transcriptome protocols. As most scRNA-seq datasets use 3′-based sequencing, most AS events cannot be properly analysed or visualized. Another limitation of <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is its inability to correct for technical confounders of sequencing coverage (such as GC and 5′/3′ bias) in its coverage visualization, as <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> only uses a single normalization factor per sample for each ASE. Although batch-correction is a feature implemented in <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> via its GLM-based differential analysis, batch correction cannot be factored into its coverage normalization algorithm.</p>
    <p>In summary, <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> is a fast, accessible and user-friendly interactive tool for AS analysis, and sets a new standard in splicing visualization via group normalized coverage plots.</p>

      <title>Quantifying percent-spliced-in</title>
      <p>ASEs, including annotated IR events, are quantified in <italic toggle="yes">SpliceWiz</italic> using PSI, which is calculated using equation (<xref rid="deqn02" ref-type="disp-formula">2</xref>). ASE isoforms are designated by the size of the alternately spliced region, which is defined to be larger in the included isoform compared with the excluded isoform. For events where alternatively spliced regions are mutually exclusive (namely MXE, AFE and ALE), the included isoform is defined as that which contains the shorter first intron. For details on annotation of ASEs, see Supplementary Methods and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>: </p>

      <p>Included and excluded isoform abundances are estimated based on counts of junction reads, noting that such reads do not require length normalization unlike expression estimation using reads aligned to exon bodies. The exception is the included isoform in IR events (i.e. the retained intron), whereby we followed the approach of <italic toggle="yes">IRFinder</italic> [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] in using the (30% trimmed) mean depth of coverage across the measured intron. For isoforms that encompass two (tandem) splice junctions (i.e. included cassette exons or mutually exclusive exons), isoform abundances were estimated using mean counts of the two junctions.</p>

    <sec id="sec15">
      <title>Differential ASE analysis using established statistical tools in R</title>
      <p>Functions for performing GLM-based differential ASE analysis were implemented using wrapper functions to established statistical methods <italic toggle="yes">limma</italic> [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], <italic toggle="yes">DESeq2</italic> [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">edgeR</italic> [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These were implemented as follows: At the data collation step, two matrices are compiled, each containing estimated included and excluded isoform abundances. Columns in these matrices represent samples whereas rows represent ASEs. During differential expression analysis, two separate analyses are performed. First, differential analysis is performed separately on each of library-normalized included and excluded counts. Assuming a contrasting condition ‘Treatment’ and a batch factor condition ‘Batch’, the model is described in equation (<xref rid="deqn03" ref-type="disp-formula">3</xref>), where the last term is the contrasting term. This step provides information on whether the change in AS is due to changes in either included or excluded isoform abundances, or both: </p>
      <disp-formula id="deqn03">
        <label>(3)</label>

\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}
\begin{document}
\begin{equation*} design\sim 0+ Batch+ Treatment \end{equation*}\end{document}</tex-math>
      </disp-formula>
      <p>Subsequently, the two matrices (of raw counts) are concatenated column-wise, and an extra ‘ASE’ condition is added to the column (sample) annotations which specifies whether each column represents included or excluded isoforms. Differential ASE analysis is performed using a GLM model as described in equation (<xref rid="deqn04" ref-type="disp-formula">4</xref>), where again the last term is the contrasting term. This step assesses changes in the ratios of included and excluded counts: </p>

      <p>We also implemented a wrapper using <italic toggle="yes">DoubleExpSeq</italic> [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which supports contrasts between two conditions (note that GLM-based models are not supported for the <italic toggle="yes">DoubleExpSeq</italic> wrapper).
