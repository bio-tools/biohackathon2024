      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Deoxyribonucleic acid replication is one of the most crucial tasks taking place in the cell, and it has to be precisely regulated. This process is initiated in the replication origins (ORIs), and thus it is essential to identify such sites for a deeper understanding of the cellular processes and functions related to the regulation of gene expression. Considering the important tasks performed by ORIs, several experimental and computational approaches have been developed in the prediction of such sites. However, existing computational predictors for ORIs have certain curbs, such as building only single-feature encoding models, limited systematic feature engineering efforts and failure to validate model robustness. Hence, we developed a novel species-specific yeast predictor called yORIpred that accurately identify ORIs in the yeast genomes. To develop yORIpred, we first constructed optimal 40 baseline models by exploring eight different sequence-based encodings and five different machine learning classifiers. Subsequently, the predicted probability of 40 models was considered as the novel feature vector and carried out iterative feature learning approach independently using five different classifiers. Our systematic analysis revealed that the feature representation learned by the support vector machine algorithm (yORIpred) could well discriminate the distribution characteristics between ORIs and non-ORIs when compared with the other four algorithms. Comprehensive benchmarking experiments showed that yORIpred achieved superior and stable performance when compared with the existing predictors on the same training datasets. Furthermore, independent evaluation showcased the best and accurate performance of yORIpred thus underscoring the significance of iterative feature representation. To facilitate the users in obtaining their desired results without undergoing any mathematical, statistical or computational hassles, we developed a web server for the yORIpred predictor, which is available at: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://thegleelab.org/yORIpred" ext-link-type="uri">http://thegleelab.org/yORIpred</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the main carrier of genetic information for life. Before cell division, biomolecules and organelles including the duplication of DNA molecules need to be copied for appropriate distribution among the new daughter cells. This process of DNA duplication happening in the dividing cell is called DNA replication or semi-conservative replication [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. DNA replication occurs in the cytoplasm and nucleus for prokaryotes and eukaryotes, respectively. However, the basic process of DNA replication remains the same. The replication origin serves as the site for genome replication, and hence it has to be tightly regulated [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Bacterial genome has only one replication origin [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] in contrast to the presence of multiple replication origins (ORIs) in the eukaryotic genome [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Since the duplication of DNA is initiated in the ORIs, it is necessary to identify such sites for better understanding the transmission of genetic information.</p>
    <p>Several <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> experimental techniques, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), ChIP-sequencing, DNase I footprinting technique, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, gel retardation assay, isothermal titration calorimetry, replication initiation point mapping and surface plasmon resonance have been developed to identify DNA ORIs [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Lee and Bell [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] reported that the origin recognition complex (ORC) that binds ORIs could be accurately detected [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The ORIs of <italic toggle="yes">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> possess two characteristic sequence patterns [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]: (1) ORIs have highly specific sequence patterns, where ORC identifies the T-rich 17-bp ARS motif and its consensus sequence that may interact with its neighboring B1/B2/B3 elements [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and (2) ORIs’ nucleosome exclusion [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, due to their time- and cost-ineffectiveness, computational tools based on various skew types were established. High-throughput sequencing-based marker frequency analysis was developed to analyze replication characteristics and to map ORIs in both prokaryotes [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and eukaryotes [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Ori-Finder [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Ori-Finder 2 [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] apply Z-curve method and comparative genomics analysis to identify ORCs in bacterial and archaeal genomes. Other computational tools include CG software [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and GraphDNA [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The limitation of using such computational tools is that these predictors were built only based on positive samples containing information about ORIs.</p>
    <p>However, in the recent decade, this limitation has been overcome by the introduction of various computational methods, which have utilized both positive and negative samples to train the replication origin predictors and to attenuate the occurrence of false positives and false negatives. Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] predicted a method to identify ORIs based on DNA structural properties, whereas Li <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] utilized pseudo <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-tuple nucleotide compositions (PseKNC) in predicting replication origin sites in <italic toggle="yes">S. cerevisiae</italic>. Subsequently, Zhang <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and Xiao <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] integrated dinucleotide physicochemical features and position-specific features, respectively, with general pseudo amino acid composition [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and enhanced their respective predictors’ performance accuracies. Later, Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] developed a predictor called ‘iRO-3wPseKNC’ to predict ORIs in four yeast species using three-window-based PseKNC. Subsequently, the same group implemented different lengths of ORIs and Guanine/Cytosine (GC) asymmetry bias and developed a prediction algorithm called ‘iRO-PsekGCC’ for two yeast species [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Two research groups developed their respective predictors to predict ORIs in <italic toggle="yes">S. cerevisiae</italic> using the same dataset but different approaches [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Recently, Dao <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] proposed a computational platform to identify replication origin from eukaryotes, where they applied feature selection technique on hybrid features (a combination of Kmer and binary encoding) and identified optimal feature set, which improved prediction accuracies on multiple species. Among the existing methods, four methods are applicable to yeast species. Of those, two methods (iRO-3wPseKNC and iRO-PsekGCC) were developed using diverse ORI lengths, and the remaining two methods were developed using fixed ORI lengths. In this work, our primary objective was to develop species-specific prediction models from the dataset containing diverse ORI lengths. Despite the advantages of the existing methods (iRO-3wPseKNC and iRO-PsekGCC) and performance improvements [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], certain limitations cannot be ruled out: (i) existing methods employed only a single encoding and classifier; (ii) only limited feature engineering efforts have been made to explore the efficiency of different feature types and classifiers for better classification, as the existing tools focused on extracting only a few feature encodings and (iii) failure to evaluate the model transferability.</p>
    <p>By addressing the above-mentioned issues, we developed a novel species-specific predictor called yORIpred, which accurately predict ORIs from four yeast species including <italic toggle="yes">S. cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces lactis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Pichia pastoris</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>. To develop yORIpred, firstly, 40 baseline models were generated by exploring five different classification algorithms [random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and extremely randomized tree (ERT)] and eight diverse sequence encoding schemes [Kmer composition, composition of k-spaced nucleic acid pairs (CKSNAP), electron-ion interaction pseudopotentials (EIIP), dinucleotide physicochemical properties (DPCP), PseKNC, pseudo dinucleotide composition (PseDNC), series correlation pseudo trinucleotide composition (SCPseTNC) and trinucleotide physicochemical properties (TPCP)] to provide comprehensive feature information for model training. Notably, a two-step feature selection approach was employed during the baseline model generation. Secondly, the predicted probability of ORIs from 40 baseline models was considered as novel features, where iterative feature learning approach was applied to learn probabilistic features in order to promote the feature representation capability in a highly supervised iterative manner. Our systematic analysis revealed that feature representation learned by SVM has a high discrimination distribution characteristic between ORIs and non-non-ORIs when compared with the remaining four classifiers. yORIpred showed promising results in both cross-validation (CV) analysis and independent evaluation, thus indicating that the iterative feature representation is solely responsible for its accurate and robust prediction. We anticipate that our proposed predictor may help to identify novel ORIs and useful in elucidating their functional mechanisms.</p>

      <title>Dataset construction</title>
      <p>Recently, Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] constructed training datasets with the varying length for four yeast species (<italic toggle="yes">S. cerevisiae, K. lactis P. pastoris</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">S. pombe</italic>) based on DeOri database [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Of those, <italic toggle="yes">S. cerevisiae</italic> contains 341 ORI sequences and 343 non-ORI sequences; <italic toggle="yes">S. pombe</italic> contains 339 ORI sequences and 336 non-ORI sequences; <italic toggle="yes">P. pastoris</italic> contains 306 ORI sequences and 303 non-ORI sequences and <italic toggle="yes">K. lactis</italic> contains 148 ORI sequences and 148 non-ORI sequences. Since DeOri database was not updated, Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. dataset was considered in this study for the following reasons: (i) they applied several filtering schemes and constructed a reliable training dataset; (ii) none of the sequences for each species-specific dataset possesses greater than 80% sequence identity with other sequences and (iii) employing such datasets for the development of model enables a fair comparison between the existing methods and our proposed method.</p>
      <p>To evaluate our prediction model, we constructed an independent dataset for the <italic toggle="yes">S. cerevisiae</italic> species by utilizing a recently reported ORI dataset (Ori-Finder 3) [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Generally, random sequences have been used as non-ORIs, but we employed sequences other than ORI functions reported for <italic toggle="yes">S. cerevisiae</italic>. Specifically, we considered recombination hot/cold spot sequences downloaded from iRSpot-Pse6NC2.0 [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and considered them as non-ORIs. Subsequently, samples have been excluded that share &gt;75% sequence identity with the training dataset, which resulted in 67 ORIs and 837 non-ORIs.</p>

    <sec id="sec4">
      <title>Feature descriptors</title>
      <p>Generally, DNA sequences with variable length should be converted into fixed length of numerical vectors by means of feature extraction [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Here, we employed eight different feature descriptors and evaluated their contribution in classifying ORIs from non-ORI sequences, when provided as an input to different machine learning (ML) classifiers. In brief, each descriptor is described as follows:</p>

        <p>Generally, original feature dimension may contain irrelevant information, which may lead to poor performance of prediction model and low model robustness [<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51–53</xref>]. Feature selection protocol is one of the important steps in developing prediction model to reduce or remove redundancy for improving the model performance and reducing the computational time. To include more relevant information from each descriptor, feature optimization was applied on seven feature encodings (Kmer, CKSNAP, PseKNC, SCPseKNC, EIIP, DPCP and TPCP) and excluded PseDNC (18D) due to its smaller feature dimension. A systematic two-step feature selection approach was applied to identify the optimal feature set from the original feature dimension, where the first step is to rank features followed by the sequential forward search (SFS). Generally, extreme GB (XGBoost) has been known as a prediction algorithm [<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Besides prediction, it can effectively rank features according to the importance score, and it has been widely applied in various problems to identify the relevant feature set [<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].

The procedure is as follows: In the first run of the iterative strategy, 40D probabilistic feature vector obtained from step 2 inputted to ML classifier (e.g. SVM) and developed their corresponding model using 10-fold CV. The predicted probability of ORIs from the optimal model was considered as a new feature vector, which was combined with the previous 40D vector and obtained 41D feature vector. We repeat this process in an iterative manner and obtained 1D predicted probability of ORIs by training multidimensional features at each successive step, and then fusing both output and input characteristics as a input feature to the subsequent iteration process. This iterative approach will be terminated after 11 rounds to avoid over-fitting.</p>

The deterioration of the model performance due to the following reasons: (i) all features in the original dimension is equally essential for model performance, mainly encodings with lower dimension and (ii) XGBoost excluded many features by assigning zero from the higher-dimensional feature that may include relevant feature information. Instead of detailing each optimal feature set based model on different datasets, we computed the average ACC for baseline models only whose performance improved by feature selection approach and compared with the respective control. <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> shows that all five classifiers’ average improvement is similar to the range of 2.29–2.78% for the <italic toggle="yes">P. pastoris</italic> dataset.

      <title>Impact of different classifiers during iterative feature learning process</title>
      <p>We obtained the predicted probability of ORI from 40 baseline models and considered the novel features fed to five different classifiers, and independently performed an iterative feature learning process. To intuitively examine the results, we plotted ACC change as incrementing the feature dimension at each iteration step (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). The result shows that RF, ERT, GB and ANN have a common trend for each species; performance remains in equilibrium (4A, C, E and G). However, SVM has a general tendency for two species (<italic toggle="yes">K. lactis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">P. pastoris</italic>), ACC peaked at the beginning and converged to the steady-state (4A and C). In the case of <italic toggle="yes">S. cerevisiae</italic>, the ACC curve of SVM increased initially, peaked and assembled to a steady-state.

      <p>SVM-based iterative feature representation learning strategy significantly improved the performance when compared with their counterparts.

(2) SVM-based probabilistic features were inputted into four classifiers and evaluated their performance at each iteration. <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> shows that all four classifiers ACC graph topology is identical to SVM regardless of the species, thus indicating that SVM-based generated predicted probability values at each iteration step possess a very high discriminative capability between ORIs and non-ORIs. As a result, not only SVM but also other methods performed exceptionally well. Overall, the above analysis shows that the classifier’s choice (SVM) to generate probabilistic features (during the iterative approach) plays a significant role in yORIpred-improved performance.</p>

For each species, firstly, we ranked features with non-zero scores identified by XGBoost and subsequently applied SFS by employing five different classifiers (as mentioned above) and identified the corresponding optimal model. <xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> shows the performance of five different classifiers for each species. Interestingly, three classifiers’ (RF, ERT and GB) ACC curve topology are similar to each other regardless of the species. However, ANN and SVM have a different ACC curve topology. The maximum ACC achieved by the optimal feature set is shown in a green asterisk. Next, we compared the optimal models obtained from feature fusion with yORIpred, and the result is shown in <xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, where the feature fusion model is named with the prefix FF. The result shows that yORIpred performance is consistently better than feature fusion models. To get a statistical significance between yORIpred and other methods, we compared two AUC values and computed <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value using a two-tailed test [<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. By applying a <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value threshold of 0.05, yORIpred significantly outperformed all feature fusion models for two species (<italic toggle="yes">P. pastoris</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">S. cerevisiae</italic>). In the case of <italic toggle="yes">K. lactis</italic>, yORIpred performed better than FF-RF, FF-ERT and FF-GB and significantly outperformed the other two models. Furthermore, yORIpred performance is similar to other FF models in <italic toggle="yes">S. pombe</italic>. Altogether, the above comparative analysis highlights that the iterative learning approach is the sole reason for the yORIpred-improved performance.</p>

      <p>By applying a statistical cut-off of 0.05, yORIpred significantly outperformed iRO-3wPseKNC for three species, namely <italic toggle="yes">K. lactis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">P. pastoris</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">S. cerevisiae</italic> and slightly better than iRO-3wPseKNC for <italic toggle="yes">S. pombe</italic>. Furthermore, yORIpred significantly outperformed iRO-PseKGCC for both species. It should be noted that the same RF classifier with different feature encodings employed in the existing methods. As a result, it could not capture the pattern that discriminates well between ORIs and non-ORIs. However, our approach overcomes the limitations of the existing methods and the feature fusion approach employed in this study and showed excellent performance. The possible reason for yORIpred superior performance includes: (i) integrating different classifiers and feature encoding schemes and generating probabilistic features; (ii) systematic evaluation of different classifiers during iterative feature learning and selecting SVM and (iii) probability features generated by SVM shows a very high discriminative capability of ORIs from non-ORIs.</p>

      <p>We compared the predictive performance of yORIpred against the existing methods using the independent dataset for <italic toggle="yes">S. cerevisiae</italic>, which includes 67 ORIs and 837 non-ORIs. Since the dataset is imbalanced, comparison using ACC is not straightforward; hence, we used BACC to rank the methods as shown in <xref rid="TB3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The comparison results revealed that yORIpred achieved the best performance with MCC and BACC of 0.583 and 0.879. Specifically, MCC performed by yORIpred was 6.4% higher than the second-best method, iRO-3wPseKNC. Among the existing methods, iRO-PseKGCC performance was low in our evaluation. Overall, yORIpred not only performed well on the training dataset but also replicated its CV performances during independent evaluation, thus highlighting its stability and robustness in ORIs prediction.</p>

      <p>As an implementation of the developed yORIpred approach, we have made available an online web server version of yORIpred at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://thegleelab.org/yORIpred" ext-link-type="uri">http://thegleelab.org/yORIpred</ext-link>. The web server is equipped with 16 cores, 64 GB memory and a 2 TB hard disk. To utilize the yORIpred web server, users should select particular species from the homepage and input DNA sequences in the textbox or upload sequences in Fast Adaptive Shrinkage Threshold Algorithm (FASTA) format via the file-selection dialog box. The prediction results are provided in table format with detailed information about the serial number, FASTA ID, predicted class (ORIs or non-ORIs) and predicted probability of ORIs. Notably, the probability score of ORIs is in the range from 0 to 1, where a probability score close to 1 means the result is likely to be an ORI, and a score close to 0 means the result is unlikely to be an ORI. More detailed instructions for using the yORIpred web server can be found at the web server’s README page.</p>

      <title>Limitations and future work</title>
      <p>Despite the performance of yORIpred for predicting species-specific ORIs from yeast species, it has the following limitations: (i) The training dataset of yORIpred is relatively limited (especially for <italic toggle="yes">S. pombe</italic>) due to the lack of experimentally characterized ORIs. In the future, when more ORI sequences become available, additional data should be collected for the development of a more robust model and enable reliable whole-genome ORIs annotation; (ii) The existing methods employed random sequences as non-ORIs during their model construction. As a result, the prediction performance might be affected when the user provides other functional DNA sequences (promoter and coding sequence). In the future, DNA sequences other than ORI functions should be considered along with the random sequences as non-ORIs during model development, which will be helpful to eliminate the false-positive results; and (iii) yORIpred predictive capability relies on multiple ML classifiers trained on numerous sequence-derived features. Generally, the machine-learning models’ performance is directly proportional to the informative features extracted from the training dataset. In this regard, it is challenging to find a novel sequence-based encoding scheme to improve model performance. With more data available in the future, we plan to apply several classical approaches reported recently [<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">63–67</xref>] and identify the most appropriate method.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>Here, we proposed a novel species-specific yORIpred predictor for accurate identification of ORI sites from yeast species. To establish an accurate and efficient prediction model, we developed 40 baseline models by exploring various feature encodings and classical ML classifiers. Subsequently, a 40D probabilistic feature vectors generated from the baseline models were fed into SVM and an iterative feature representation learning scheme was applied to create more informative features. Our empirical studies based on CV and independent evaluation demonstrated the effectiveness of yORIpred species-specific models by outperforming the existing methods, iRO-3wPseKNC and iRO-PsekGCC. Furthermore, we demonstrated the superiority of yORIpred compared with the feature fusion approach. The improved performance of yORIpred is mainly due to the following aspects: (i) integrating different classifiers and feature encoding schemes to generate probabilistic features, (ii) identifying an appropriate SVM classifier during iterative feature learning and (iii) probabilistic features obtained through the iterative approach has a very high discrimination capacity of ORIs from non-ORIs. A user-friendly web server has been established that allows the prediction of ORIs from the given genomic sequences, which will significantly enhance its impact in driving genome biology. We anticipate that yORIpred could be a powerful tool for accurate and high-throughput ORIs prediction from DNA sequences. Moreover, the current approach could be extended to other DNA sequence-based prediction problems, such as post replication modification sites, recombination hot-spot and enhancer predictions.</p>
