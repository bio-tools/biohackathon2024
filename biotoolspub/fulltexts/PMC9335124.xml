    <abstract>
      <p>Monoclonal antibody drugs targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway have showed efficacy in the treatment of cancer patients, however, they have many intrinsic limitations and inevitable drawbacks. Peptide inhibitors as alternatives might compensate for the drawbacks of current PD-1/PD-L1 interaction blockers. Identifying PD-L1 binding peptides by random peptide library screening is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Machine learning-based computational models enable rapid discovery of peptide candidates targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. In this study, we first employed next-generation phage display (NGPD) biopanning to isolate PD-L1 binding peptides. Different peptide descriptors and feature selection methods as well as diverse machine learning methods were then incorporated to implement predictive models of PD-L1 binding. Finally, we proposed PDL1Binder, an ensemble computational model for efficiently obtaining PD-L1 binding peptides. Our results suggest that predictive models of PD-L1 binding can be learned from deep sequencing data and provide a new path to discover PD-L1 binding peptides. A web server was implemented for PDL1Binder, which is freely available at <ext-link xlink:href="http://i.uestc.edu.cn/pdl1binder/cgi-bin/PDL1Binder.pl" ext-link-type="uri">http://i.uestc.edu.cn/pdl1binder/cgi-bin/PDL1Binder.pl</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Blocking the immune checkpoint pathway is a highly promising therapeutic modality to fight cancer. Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is an immune checkpoint protein, which is mainly up-regulated on activated T cells, natural killer cells and B cells (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Freeman et al., 2000</xref>). Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a ligand for PD-1, which is highly expressed on many different malignancy cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Talantova et al., 2013</xref>). The interaction between PD-1 on T cells and PD-L1 on tumor cells leads to the inhibition of T-cell responses and loss of the cytotoxic T-cells’ functions and thereby mediates tumor cells to escape from the host immune surveillance. Blockade of this pathway can activate tumor-infiltrating T cells and restore their anti-tumor activity (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Tumeh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Wolchok and Chan, 2014</xref>). Therefore, PD-1 and PD-L1 have become attractive therapeutic targets against cancer. Neoadjuvant anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy also achieved satisfactory clinical results in tumors (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2021b</xref>).</p>
    <p>Six PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) blockers to date have been approved by FDA for cancer treatment (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Postow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Robert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, most of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in the clinical development are mAbs (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2020</xref>). Although mAbs targeting either PD-1 or PD-L1 have showed certain anti-tumor efficacy in cancer patients (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Hamanishi et al., 2016</xref>), current mAb agents have many intrinsic limitations such as expensive production, still poor therapeutic responses (only approximately 20% of patients with a durable response) (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2016</xref>), and considerable individual differences as well as immunotherapy-induced improper immune-related responses (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Fishman et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, mAb therapeutics are accompanied by inevitable drawbacks including inferior organ or tumor penetration, poor oral bioavailability and immunogenicity. Compared to mAbs, peptides as drug candidates have several advantages, including higher tissue or tumor penetration, lower production costs and decreased immunogenicity. Peptides can also be subjected to chemical modifications to improve their pharmaceutical properties. However, PD-L1 binding peptides discovery through random peptide library screening is time consuming, expensive, and laborious.</p>
    <p>In order to improve the efficiency of phage display selection, researchers have employed computational methods to aid analysis of results of random peptide library screening. For example, SAROTUP integrates a suite of tools which can be used to scan, report and exclude possible target-unrelated peptides from phage display biopanning results (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2019b</xref>). <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al. (2016)</xref> have proposed an epitope prediction method based on random peptide library screening. Machine learning methods have been used in mining and designing peptides of specific function (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Tallorin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2022</xref>). Obtaining therapeutic molecules is cheap and fast with the help of machine learning approaches (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Laustsen et al., 2021</xref>). However, there are currently no bioinformatics tools to identify PD-L1 binding peptides.</p>
    <p>Phage display permits high-throughput screening of peptide ligands with high affinity and specificity for almost any target of interest through several rounds of target-binding (selection) and amplification of phage display peptide libraries (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Jaroszewicz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Ledsgaard et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, phage display coupled with next-generation sequencing (NGPD) offers a more powerful tool to identify peptide ligands (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Matochko and Derda, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2018a</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2019c</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Asar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Pleiko et al., 2021</xref>). Fewer biopanning rounds powered by deep sequencing can discover robust target-binding peptides that are not identified by Sanger sequencing (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Juds et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, NGPD has been revealed very effective to suppress false-positive hits from amplification-induced bias (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Matochko et al., 2014</xref>). Many researchers have employed traditional phage display technology to identify PD-L1 binding peptides (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2021a</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Tooyserkani et al., 2021</xref>), however, current existing PD-L1 binding peptides are not enough to implement a computational model for identifying PD-L1 binding peptides. NGPD can help to discover more novel PD-L1 binding peptide ligands. Illumina sequencing is a massively parallel sequencing technology and can produce large amounts of data (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Quail et al., 2008</xref>). We screened the Ph.D.-12 phage display library against PD-L1, and here the selection output was investigated using Illumina sequencing.</p>
    <p>In the present study, we aimed to develop a novel computational classifier for identifying peptides targeting PD-L1. We took advantage of NGPD to isolate PD-L1 binding peptides and used them to construct the predictive model <italic>via</italic> machine learning methods. First, we used PD-L1 as bait to screen the Ph.D.-12 phage display library. Second, the PD-L1 binding peptides isolated by phage display selection were paired with non-PD-L1 binding peptides. They were used to implement machine learning based models for predicting PD-L1 binding peptides. Third, we utilized two independent testing datasets to evaluate the generalization ability of the models. The PD-L1 binding peptides identified in this work hold high potential to be developed as anti-tumor therapeutics. The predictor for identifying peptides targeting PD-L1, called PDL1Binder, is valuable in accelerating PD-L1 binding peptides discovery and freely available at <ext-link xlink:href="http://i.uestc.edu.cn/pdl1binder/cgi-bin/PDL1Binder.pl" ext-link-type="uri">http://i.uestc.edu.cn/pdl1binder/cgi-bin/PDL1Binder.pl</ext-link>. Our study demonstrates that predictive models of PD-L1 binding can be learned from deep sequencing data and provides an efficient approach to discover PD-L1 binding peptides.</p>

      <title>Phage display peptide library biopanning</title>
      <p>We performed two rounds of phage display selection using recombinant human PD-L1 extracellular domain (ECD) protein (Cat# 10084-H08H, Sino Biological Inc., Beijing, China) as bait. The selection of Ph.D.-12 phage display library (New England Biolabs, Ipswitch, MA, United States) against PD-L1 was performed in six replicates. The control selections, i.e., Ph.D.-12 against Dynabeads (Cat# 10-103-D, Invitrogen) and Ph.D.-12 against unrelated anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Cat# F3165, Sigma-Aldrich), were performed in triplicate.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="S2.SS2">
      <title>Round 1</title>
      <p>In a microcentrifuge tube, 20 μL of Dynabeads were coated with a solution of PD-L1 (100 μL, 100 μg/mL) in PBS for overnight at 4 C. The solution was added to 900 μL of PBS and then transferred to a well in the KingFisher 96 deep-well plate (Cat# 95040450, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The Dynabeads with PD-L1 were rinsed 3 times with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS, and then blocked with 2% (w/v) BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, followed by an incubation with 3 × 10<sup>11</sup> PFU Ph.D.-12 phage display library for 1.5 h at room temperature. The unbound phage was rinsed with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS. Phage remained on the beads were eluted for 9 min at room temperature by adding 20 μL of HCl (pH 2). The elution buffer along with the beads were transferred into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and immediately neutralized with 10 μL of neutralization buffer (Phusion HF Buffer, NEB B0518S). The recovered phage was amplified in <italic>E. coli</italic> ER2738 (New England Biolabs, Ipswitch, MA, United States) for the second round of biopanning.</p>

    <sec id="S2.SS3">
      <title>Round 2</title>
      <p>Six microcentrifuge tubes containing 20 μL of Dynabeads were coated with a solution of PD-L1 (100 μL, 100 μg/mL) in PBS for overnight at 4 C. An additional three microcentrifuge tubes containing 20 μL of Dynabeads were coated with a solution of Protein G (100 μg/mL) along with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (150 μg/mL) in 100 μL PBS for overnight at 4 C. In parallel, three more microcentrifuge tubes containing 20 μL of Dynabeads were suspended in 100 μL PBS for overnight at 4 C. Solution from all 12 microcentrifuge tubes were then, respectively, added to 900 μL of PBS and transferred to 12 wells in a KingFisher 96 deep-well plate. The Dynabeads were rinsed with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS, and then blocked with 2% (w/v) BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with 3 × 10<sup>10</sup> PFU enriched Ph.D.-12 phage display library from Round 1 for 1.5 h at room temperature. The unbound phage was rinsed with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS five times. Phage remained on the beads were resuspended in DNase free water and boiled at 90 C for 10 min. The single-stranded DNAs (ssDNAs) from discovered phage were extracted and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and Illumina sequencing, and those from Ph.D.-12 libraries before and after the first round of biopanning were also sequenced to serve as additional controls. The steps for Illumina sequencing of phage display libraries were described previously (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2018b</xref>). Briefly, PCR amplification was first performed to transform the ssDNA of the amplified phage into Illumina-compatible double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). The detailed PCR protocol for Illumina sequencing can be found in the <xref rid="DS4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Information</xref>. After PCR amplification, the dsDNA PCR fragments corresponding to the expected size were confirmed and quantified using agarose gel electrophoresis. The PCR products from multiple experiments were then mixed together allowing 20 ng of each product in the mixture and purified by E-Gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). The purified dsDNAs were finally sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq paired-end 500/550 High Output Kit v2 (150 cycles).</p>

Sequences isolated from the PD-L1 screen that increased significantly in abundance against sequences isolated from the control selections were labeled PD-L1 binding peptides. Significance of the ratio was assessed using one-tailed, unequal variance Student <italic>t</italic>-test. Only sequences with ratio ≥ 2 and <italic>p</italic>-value ≤ 0.05 were considered as PD-L1 binding peptides. Deep sequencing the library before round 1 (R0), the output of two selection rounds (R1 and R2) and the control selection experiments identified 80 peptide sequences that exhibited high normalized abundance in R2 and low normalized abundance in R0, R1, and the control experiments R2-DB (Dynabeads), and R2-UF (unrelated anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody).</p>

      <p>The positive dataset was composed of 80 PD-L1 binding peptides identified by NGPD. The remaining peptides were non-PD-L1 binding peptides, which consisted of the negative dataset. Redundant peptides were then removed by using CD-HIT (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Li and Godzik, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2012</xref>), with a sequence identity threshold of 0.8 for the PD-L1 and non-PD-L1 binding peptides, respectively. We used this value based on the size of our dataset. More stringent criteria, such as 0.4 or 0.3, were not adopted because machine learning algorithms could not acquire abundant information to learn with a relatively small sample. After this analysis, no redundant peptides were found and excluded, and the positive training dataset consisted of 80 PD-L1 peptides. To balance the positive and negative training dataset, we randomly selected 800 peptides from the negative dataset and divided them into 10 sub-datasets. Each negative sub-dataset was paired with the positive training dataset. Finally, 10 pairs of sub-datasets were constructed and each pair was composed of 80 PD-L1 and 80 non-PD-L1 binding peptides (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

      <p>The literature data related to PD-L1 binding peptides were extracted from the PubMed database. A typical text mining query is given below: (anti-PD-L1 peptide) OR (PD-L1 binding peptide). The search returned 652 articles published before July 08, 2021. PD-L1 binding peptide sequences were then manually extracted from the above peer-reviewed papers. Modified peptides (peptides with non-natural amino acids) were first excluded since no modified peptides were in the training dataset. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) peptides containing only 20 natural amino acids and less than 50 residues were collected since peptides having more than 50 amino acids were considered as proteins; (2) peptides that have been experimentally verified to bind with PD-L1 <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> were collected. Finally, 34 experimentally validated PD-L1 binding peptides were obtained. After removing redundant peptides by using CD-HIT with a sequence identity cutoff of 0.8, 30 PD-L1 binding peptides were retained. Consequently, we constructed two independent testing datasets, i.e., TestDataset_1 (30 PD-L1 binding peptides) and TestDataset_2 [221405 non-PD-L1 binding peptides from the remaining negative dataset (not for training)] (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). As the sources of the two datasets are different, they were tested separately.

      <title>Final model construction and web service implementation</title>
      <p>Ten submodels were constructed based on SVM by using the LIBSVM 3.25 package (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chang and Lin, 2011</xref>), which is available at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/</ext-link>. The radial basis function (RBF) was selected as the kernel function to develop SVM-based models. The kernel width factor <italic>gamma</italic> and the regularization factor <italic>c</italic> were automatically optimized by selecting the “Auto optimization” option <italic>via</italic> the grid search method in iLearnPlus (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). To reduce the generalization error of the prediction, we adopted the voting strategy to implement an ensemble predictor, called PDL1Binder. The ensemble model aggregates the predictive result of each submodel. In this study, we used the averaging voting technique, which takes an average of predictions from ten submodels and uses it to make the final prediction. Each peptide for prediction will be subjected to the prediction of ten submodels. Each submodel corresponds to a possibility value of the peptide being a PD-L1 binding peptide. The final probability value was computed by averaging the probability values of ten submodels. If the value is greater than or equal to the threshold of possibility value (0.5 by default), the peptide will be identified as a PD-L1 binding peptide.</p>
      <p>For ease of use, the PDL1Binder classifier was further implemented into an online web service, which is freely available at <ext-link xlink:href="http://i.uestc.edu.cn/pdl1binder/cgi-bin/PDL1Binder.pl" ext-link-type="uri">http://i.uestc.edu.cn/pdl1binder/cgi-bin/PDL1Binder.pl</ext-link>. The web interface of PDL1Binder was developed by using Perl. The web service was tested in the Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Internet Explorer browsers.</p>

    <title>Results</title>
    <p>The workflow of this study is shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. We first isolated 80 PD-L1 binding peptides by using NGPD and utilized them as the benchmark dataset to develop computational models for identifying PD-L1 binding peptides. Four different peptide descriptors were employed to encode each peptide sequence. The optimal feature selection approach chosen from five feature selection strategies and 12 machine learning methods were combined to implement predictive models. Fivefold cross-validation results showed that the SVM-based model outperformed models developed with 11 other machine learning algorithms. Therefore, an ensemble SVM-based computational model, called PDL1Binder, was implemented. Moreover, two independent testing dataset: TestDataset_1 (30 PD-L1 binding peptides) and TestDataset_2 (221405 non-PD-L1 binding peptides not for training) were used to evaluate PDL1Binder.</p>

      <title>Selection and analysis of peptides that bind to programmed cell death ligand 1</title>
      <p>We used the Ph.D.-12 phage display library to discover peptide ligands for PD-L1. Two rounds of phage display selection were performed using PD-L1 ECD as bait. In round 2, we also performed two control selections; in the first control, we panned the enriched Ph.D.-12 library from Round 1 against the Dynabeads (R2-DB) and in the second control, we panned the enriched Ph.D.-12 library from Round 1 against unrelated anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (R2-UF). Deep sequencing the library before round 1 (R0), the output of two selection rounds (R1 and R2) and the control selection experiments identified 80 peptide sequences that exhibited high normalized abundance in R2 and low normalized abundance in R0, R1, and the control experiments R2-DB, and R2-UF.</p>
      <p>All 80 potential peptide binders for PD-L1 were significantly enriched (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, <italic>R</italic> ≥ 2) in the selection of the Ph.D.-12 phage display library on PD-L1 but not in any of the control screens (<xref rid="DS4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). We clustered the hit sequences based on their features described by the BLOSUM62 matrix and found that 29 peptides were clustered into five groups (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The remaining un-clustered sequences were assigned to their nearest clusters (<xref rid="DS4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).</p>

      <p>Finally, we investigated whether 80 PD-L1 binders could be target-unrelated peptides which are enriched for other reasons other than target specificity. MimoSearch and MimoScan confirmed that YPGSQSWMPSDF has been previously selected by IgE from patients, while the remaining 79 peptides have not been identified in other phage display biopanning datasets which are curated in BDB. As YPGSQSWMPSDF was only identified with two different targets so far, it was not considered as a target-unrelated peptide and remained for further analysis.</p>

      <p>The AAC, DPC, CKSAAGP, and PseAAC descriptors were used to encode each peptide in the training dataset. We directly concatenated four types of peptide descriptors. As a result, the dimension of the feature vector of each peptide is 519 (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). For each of the ten sub-datasets, feature selection was performed by using five popular feature selection approaches, respectively. The number of selected features was determined to be 160 to keep the same as the number of peptides in the training dataset.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>Many studies have demonstrated that PD-L1 binding peptides are promising for the treatment of cancers (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2021</xref>). PD-L1 binding peptides screened by phage display selection in this study could serve as peptide drug candidates for blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. However, only a few tens of PD-L1 binding peptides have been experimentally identified. In fact, many candidate molecules are needed to develop a peptide drug for cancer immunotherapy. Therefore, it is urgently needed to employ computational methods to rapidly identify more novel PD-L1 binding peptides.</p>
    <p>At present, no computational models have been proposed for efficiently discovering PD-L1 binding peptides. To pursue identifying PD-L1 binding peptides from pools of peptides with unknown functions, we designed a SVM-based classifier based on sequence information, called PDL1Binder, which could help to eliminate false positive peptides and improve the efficiency of obtaining PD-L1 binding peptides. The classifier integrates 10 SVM submodels. Two independent testing datasets were constructed to test the performance of PDL1Binder. Here, 83.33% of PD-L1 binding peptides in the TestDataset_1 were correctly identified as PD-L1 binding peptides, while 53.29% of non-PD-L1 binding peptides were precisely predicted as non-PD-L1 binding peptides in the TestDataset_2 when the <italic>tp</italic>-value was set to 0.55 within PDL1Binder. The proposed approach is considered as an applicable scheme for assisting the development of novel PD-L1 binding peptides.</p>
    <p>PDL1Binder could be beneficial for both panning experiments and subsequent affinity determination experiments. The model can help researchers remove as many non-PD-L1 binding peptides as possible, thereby reducing both time and costs involved in getting PD-L1 binding peptide candidates. After testing on two independent test sets, we found that PDL1Binder was able to help remove around 5% of non-PD-L1 binding peptides (TestDataset_2) while retaining almost all PD-L1 binding peptides (TestDataset_1) (<italic>tp</italic> = 0.2). When the tp-value was set to 0.5, PDL1Binder correctly predicted 83.33% of PD-L1 binding peptides (TestDataset_1) while clearing away 44.31% of non-PD-L1 binding peptides (TestDataset_2). Additionally, our tool could successfully eliminate more than half of non-PD-L1 binding peptides (53.29%, TestDataset_2) while reserving 83.33% of PD-L1 binding peptides (TestDataset_1) (<italic>tp</italic> = 0.55). In the actual situation of random peptide library screening experiment, PD-L1 binding peptides are fewer and more precious, so researchers wish to keep as many putative PD-L1 binding peptides as possible in an experiment, while the proportion of non-PD-L1 binding peptides is much larger than that of PD-L1 binding peptides, thereby they wish to remove as many non-PD-L1 binding peptides as possible. We recommend users to set <italic>tp</italic> at 0.55 when using PDL1Binder since both the predictive accuracy of PD-L1 binding and that of non-PD-L1 binding have reached their maximum under this threshold. The above results indicate that PDL1Binder might save a significant amount of time and cost, greatly improving the efficiency of discovering PD-L1 binding peptides.</p>
    <p>In the process of removing redundant peptides from 80 PD-L1 binding peptides identified by phage display screen, no redundant peptides were found and excluded. This suggests that these PD-L1 binding peptides seem to have a low sequence identity (below 0.8), which indicates that there are fewer features that are consistent within the PD-L1 binding sequences in the low-dimensional space. The SVM algorithm first projects the features in a low-dimensional space to those in a high-dimensional feature space through the RBF kernel function, and more consistent features are found in the high-dimensional feature space. We speculate that this might be a reason why SVM is superior to other machine learning algorithms. Another possible reason might be that LIBSVM utilizes L1 regularization (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chang and Lin, 2011</xref>), which could effectively avoid overfitting on a small training dataset. SVM with RBF kernel (RBFSVM) can handle the overfitting problem through selecting appropriate kernel width factor <italic>gamma</italic> and regularization factor <italic>c</italic>.</p>
    <p>Our dataset for training is relatively small. More experimentally validated PD-L1 binding peptides will be needed to improve the performance of the computational model for identifying PD-L1 binding peptides. In the future, we will continue to improve the model and synthesize potential PD-L1 binding peptides predicted by the model to experimentally show if they can bind with PD-L1.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>PD-L1 binding peptides are potential therapeutic agents for treating cancers. The PD-L1 binding peptides identified by phage display screen in this study are promising to become peptide drug candidates for blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction to combat cancer. Computational models for identifying PD-L1 binding peptides can accelerate the discovery of these novel drug candidates. This study proposes the first SVM-based computational model, PDL1Binder, for effectively predicting peptides targeting PD-L1. We implemented PDL1Binder into an online web-server, which is freely accessible at <ext-link xlink:href="http://i.uestc.edu.cn/pdl1binder/cgi-bin/PDL1Binder.pl" ext-link-type="uri">http://i.uestc.edu.cn/pdl1binder/cgi-bin/PDL1Binder.pl</ext-link>. Our study showcases the potential of machine learning approaches for mining PD-L1 binding peptides from peptide pools of unknown bioactivities and provides promising PD-L1 binding peptide candidates for in-depth investigations.</p>
