        <title>Background</title>
        <p>DNA methylation profiling reveals important differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of the genome that are altered during development or that are perturbed by disease. To date, few programs exist for regional analysis of enriched or whole-genome bisulfate conversion sequencing data, even though such data are increasingly common. Here, we describe an open-source, optimized method for determining empirically based DMRs (eDMR) from high-throughput sequence data that is applicable to enriched whole-genome methylation profiling datasets, as well as other globally enriched epigenetic modification data.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Results</title>
        <p>Here we show that our bimodal distribution model and weighted cost function for optimized regional methylation analysis provides accurate boundaries of regions harboring significant epigenetic modifications. Our algorithm takes the spatial distribution of CpGs into account for the enrichment assay, allowing for optimization of the definition of empirical regions for differential methylation. Combined with the dependent adjustment for regional p-value combination and DMR annotation, we provide a method that may be applied to a variety of datasets for rapid DMR analysis. Our method classifies both the directionality of DMRs and their genome-wide distribution, and we have observed that shows clinical relevance through correct stratification of two Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) tumor sub-types.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>Our weighted optimization algorithm eDMR for calling DMRs extends an established DMR R pipeline (methylKit) and provides a needed resource in epigenomics. Our method enables an accurate and scalable way of finding DMRs in high-throughput methylation sequencing experiments. eDMR is available for download at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://code.google.com/p/edmr/">http://code.google.com/p/edmr/</ext-link>.</p>

  <sec>
    <title>Background</title>
    <p>Advanced, high-throughput sequencing technologies allow for fast, single-base resolution scans of entire epigenome. Large-scale sequencing projects are producing these datasets for cancer research, and these epigenetic marks provide important information about cellular phenotypes in normal and diseased tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. DNA methylation pattern changes are pivotal marks needed in cells' differentiation during tissue and lineage specification, and, as such, contribute to the complexity of organisms' cellular sub-types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, aberrant DNA methylation not only defines malignant subtypes of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], but also contributes to malignant disease pathophysiology and can be used in clinical outcome predictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p>
    <p>Bisulfite sequencing of genomic DNA is a widely applied method for methylation measurement. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing is a genome-wide technique for the measurement of DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, other enrichment DNA methylation sequencing methods have been developed to achieve cost-effective coverage of variable regions of DNA methylation. These methods often utilize reduced representation of bisulfite sequencing by focusing on restriction sites, including methods such as Reduced Representation Bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], Enhanced RRBS (ERRBS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], multiplexed RRBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], as well as other enrichment approaches, including methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and methylated DNA binding domain sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p>
    <p>Previously, epigenome analysis tools such as methylKit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] have focused on comprehensive DNA methylation analysis of single base sites, in order to find differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs). However, biological regulation by methylation can be mediated by a single CpG or by a group of CpGs in close proximity to each other. Therefore, a combination of baseresolution analysis and regional analysis of DNA methylation may offer a more comprehensive and systematic view of bisulfate sequencing data. This increasing demand for tools to find differentially methylated regions (DMRs) increases as more data emerge from both large-scale epigenomics consortiums and from individual labs. To address this need, we have created eDMR, which exists as stand-alone code for use with other tools and packages. It can also be used as an expansion of the methylKit R package for comprehensive DMR analysis. eDMR can directly take objects from methylKit or data frames with differential methylation information, or any DMC result in bed file format, and perform regional optimization calling and DMR statistical analysis and filtering. Furthermore, eDMR offers annotation functions that map DMRs to gene body features (coding sequences, introns, promoters, 5' untranslated regions (UTR), and 3'UTR), CpG island and shore locations, as well as the use of any other user-supplied coordinate files for annotation. Here, we describe an example of using eDMR with DNA methylation data from the ERRBS protocol.</p>

      <title>Data source</title>
      <p>Ten acute myeloid leukemia (AML) de-identified patient samples enriched for myeloblast cells and five normal bone marrow (NBM) samples (purchased from AllCells) were used in the experiments. Institutional review board approval was obtained at Weill Cornell Medical Center and at the Royal Adelaide Hospital and this study was performed in accordance with the Helsinki protocols. DNA was extracted using standard techniques and ERRBS library preparations were performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq2000 Illumina machine using 75 bp single-end reads to an average depth of 79X per covered CpG. A previously published dataset of two AML subtypes (IDH mutants and MLL rearranged) and two CD34+ normal bone marrow controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] (GEO accession number GSE37454) was also used in the analysis.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Computational tools</title>
      <p>R version 2.15.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and methylKit 0.5.6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] were used for the analysis. eDMR depends on Bioconductor packages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], including methylKit 0.5.6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], GenomicRanges 1.8.13, data.table 1.8.6, mixtools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], doMC 1.2.5, ggplot2 0.9.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Data preprocessing</title>
      <p>We performed bisulfite treated read alignment to hg19 genome and methylation calls as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Five NBM samples served as controls for the AML samples. The total coverage for each CpG in the controls is the sum coverage from 5 NBM samples. The methylation level for each CpG in the control is the mean of all NBM samples. We required the coverage of each CpG site be equal or greater than 10X in at least 3 NBM samples for control. For AML samples, the coverage for each CpG site for each sample is 10X. We used fisher exact test from methylKit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] to compare AML samples with control.</p>
    </sec>

      <title>eDMR algorithm</title>
      <p>Our eDMR algorithm contains five distinct components, which are described below (Also see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> for a workflow of the eDMR analysis). Our definition of a DNA methylated region is a cluster of CpGs in close spatial proximity. If two adjacent CpGs are separated by more than a certain (algorithm-specified) genomic distance, we define them as coming from different methylated regions. If two CpGs are within a specified genomic distance from each other, then we define them to be within the same region. The eDMR algorithm aims to optimize the threshold for determining DNA methylation regions and to perform statistical significance testing.</p>

        <title>1. Empirical regions boundary determination</title>
        <p>We used a bimodal normal distribution to identify the optimum cutoff for calling a gap between two DMRs. First, we examined the distribution of the distance between adjacent CpGs (with a coverage &gt;= 10X) across the genome from Sample 1 of our AML dataset. After a log2 transformation, we observed a bimodal distribution with a spike at log2 distance = 0 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1). This spike represents the reverse complement of CpGs (GpCs) on the other strand, which has a distance of 1 bp (log2 (1) = 0). Disregarding the strand of CpGs, the base pair distance is counted as 1 bp (log2 (1) = 0). Because we expect the threshold of gap between adjacent methylated regions will be much greater than 1 bp, the frequency for this portion does not contribute to our decision process for DMR determination. After removing the first spike at 0 log2 distance, we then used this dataset with the application of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to fit to a bimodal normal distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p>

        <p>We then sought to determine the best separation point between the two normal distributions, which will help determine the cutoff of log2 distances between the nearest two CpGs at DMR boundaries. Since the distributions overlap in ERRBS data, we risked mislabeling components from one population to another. However, ERRBS is an enrichment assay, and, as such, the detected CpGs were not evenly distributed along the genome. Instead, the CpGs formed in clusters. This contributed to the imbalance of the two populations (regional CpGs' distance distribution and boundary CpGs' distance distribution). To account for this difference, we used a weighted, combined probability function <inline-formula><mml:math id="M3" name="1471-2105-14-S5-S10-i3" overflow="scroll"><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo class="MathClass-open">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo class="MathClass-close">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> to evaluate and characterize the cumulative cost of any given separation point <italic>x</italic>.</p>

Based on the refined regions, we calculated the significance of the regions by combining the p-values of DMCs within that region. We used the dependence adjustment of the Stouffer-Liptak test to combine p-values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Unlike the adjustment for the Fisher's combined probability test, the Stouffer-Liptak joint p-value does not depend on the assumption that the p-values are normally distributed, and thus can be applied for nonparametric data. A FDR (False Discovery Rate) correction was also applied to correct for multiple hypothesis testing for the combined p-values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p>

To aid in such global examinations, we also provide convenient functions to examine the DMRs for a given dataset, including data about the distribution of the length of DMRs, overall methylation difference distribution, and the number of DMCs in each DMR for all the samples.

      <title>eDMR definition</title>
      <p>To determine DMRs, we sought to determine the optimal parameters for regional analysis. ERRBS and other enriched bisulfate conversion sequencing techniques are designed to cover cytosines in CpG-enriched regions, such as CpG islands and regions surrounding digestion sites from restriction enzymes. To accurately define the distinct genomic regions of DNA methylation, we first examined the distribution of the genomic distance between adjacent CpGs covered in the ERRBS data (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1). Since ERRBS uses the MspI restriction enzyme to fragment DNA, we detected CpGs clustered in CpG-rich regions, which were in close proximity to each other.</p>
      <p>These CpG distances established a range of CpGs in close spatial proximity, and the distance cutoff was next determined by eDMR. If two CpGs were far away from each other, then we defined them as coming from different methylated regions (boundary CpGs); on the other hand, if two CpGs were close to each other, then we defined them as coming from the same region (regional CpGs). The eDMR algorithm optimized the threshold for calling methylated regions and performed statistical tests on the methylated regions. A nonparametric density plot of the distribution of the log2 distance of the nearest CpGs showed compelling evidence for a bimodal distribution (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1, dashed line). We assumed that the first mode was composed of regional CpGs and that the second mode was composed of boundary CpGs, for the following reasons: (1) the mean of the first mode was less than the mean of the second mode, and (2) the first mode of the bimodal distribution had a larger mixing proportion than the second mode (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).</p>
      <p>To determine the optimum cutoff of two adjacent CpGs for calling a DMR boundary, we then sought to determine the best separation point between the two normal distributions. We used this weighted combined probability function <inline-formula><mml:math id="M8" name="1471-2105-14-S5-S10-i3" overflow="scroll"><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo class="MathClass-open">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo class="MathClass-close">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> to evaluate and optimize the separation of the two populations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). We then determined the minimum of the weighted sum of the cost function at the red line in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>.</p>
      <p>This information was used in our eDMR algorithm to identify the optimum cutoff for calling a gap between two DMRs. This approach was tested on an additional set of 14 ERRBS samples (9 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 5 normal bone marrow controls), which revealed similar bimodal distributions (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S2). The mean optimum distance cutoff for all 10 comparisons is 183.50 with standard error of the mean 5.08 (183.50 ± 5.08). After determining the statistically significant DMRs between two samples or groups, the regions were filtered further based on the number of DMCs (minimum of one) and CpGs (minimum of three) within the area, as well as the mean methylation difference (greater than 20%). eDMR can utilize data from methylKit and other DNA methylation pipeline outputs for analysis as well as usersupplied coordinate files for annotation (See Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> for a workflow of the eDMR analysis).</p>

The CpG genomic distribution in these samples also had a bimodal distribution (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). We used eDMR to calculate the number of DMRs between the two tumor sub-types (IDH and MLL) and the normal controls. Similar to previous findings using DMCs alone, unique patterns of DMRs were detected in the two leukemia sample subtypes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Specifically, IDH AMLs had more hypermethylated DMRs while MLL AMLs had more hypomethylated DMRs. Notably, eDMR revealed that the two tumor sub-types also showed differing DMR lengths (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>; p = 2.2 × 10<sup>-16</sup>, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), which showed that our method can replicate previous results and also provide further insight into the epigenomic landscape of these two AML subtypes.</p>

      <p>We then examined the spatial changes of the DMRs relative to other genome features. It has been reported that DNA methylation of different parts of the gene body may exert alternate effects on gene expression. Indeed, methylation on promoter regions of the gene tends to have inverse association with gene expression, while genic methylation changes have a more positive correlation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Thus, we sought to curate DMRs with a detailed annotation map, and eDMR functions were created to accomplish this task. We annotated the DMRs identified in the AML samples using Refseq gene models, separated into coding sequence, introns, promoters, 5' UTR and 3' UTR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). We also annotated DMRs with CpG islands and shores (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). These separate gene and genomic geographies allow a more granular examination of the underlying methylation changes in a dataset that may have a regulatory impact on gene transcription.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>Profiling DNA methylation changes is a broadly studied topic for basic research across many laboratories. These data are being generated in several large-scale projects, including the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Consortium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/">http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/</ext-link>), Epigenomics RoadMap (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/">http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/</ext-link>), and the EU's Blueprint Project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.blueprint-epigenome.eu/">http://www.blueprint-epigenome.eu/</ext-link>). All of these projects provide an abundance of DNA methylation and epigenetic data using DNA methylation sequencing methods like ERRBS, as well as other per-base epigenetic information. Having the ability to dissect the patterns of DNA methylation changes from a regional perspective, rather than at a per-base level, is important for researchers to more completely understand the effects DNA methylation changes have in normal and diseased samples.</p>
    <p>Here, we described eDMR - a set of convenient tools for regional analysis of methylation with optimization algorithms. These independent tools can also be utilized in concert with an existing, open-source R-package that automates other aspects of ERRBS analysis (methylKit) such as data processing and DMC analysis. As such, these methods are suitable for any base-level dataset of reduced representation or other base-level DNA modification data sets. These methods are efficient with existing datasets, recapitulate the characterized tumor-subtypes from a positive control data set, and find new aspects of the tumor biology that can only be discovered using a regional analysis. Also, we note that we have used these tools on 15 samples and found the methods to be robust on ERRBS data from both different sample types and at a variety of sequencing depths. All together, these results support the utility of eDMR as a broadly relevant method for DMR characterization, which can be used to further discoveries of epigenetic and regulatory changes and help discern the relevance of DMRs to disease biology in conjunction with other molecular profiling data types.</p>
