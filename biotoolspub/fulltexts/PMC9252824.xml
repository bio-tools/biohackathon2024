      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>With the proliferation of genomic sequence data for biomedical research, the exploration of human genetic information by domain experts requires a comprehensive interrogation of large numbers of scientific publications in PubMed. However, a query in PubMed essentially provides search results sorted only by the date of publication. A search engine for retrieving and interpreting complex relations between biomedical concepts in scientific publications remains lacking. Here, we present pubmedKB, a web server designed to extract and visualize semantic relationships between four biomedical entity types: variants, genes, diseases, and chemicals. pubmedKB uses state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques to extract semantic relations from the large number of PubMed abstracts. Currently, over 2 million semantic relations between biomedical entity pairs are extracted from over 33 million PubMed abstracts in pubmedKB. pubmedKB has a user-friendly interface with an interactive semantic graph, enabling the user to easily query entities and explore entity relations. Supporting sentences with the highlighted snippets allow to easily navigate the publications. Combined with a new explorative approach to literature mining and an interactive interface for researchers, pubmedKB thus enables rapid, intelligent searching of the large biomedical literature to provide useful knowledge and insights. pubmedKB is available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pubmedkb.cc/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.pubmedkb.cc/</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Following recent advances in genomic sequencing technologies, a large amount of genomic data has been generated in biomedical research. To interpret genomic data properly, most scientists and healthcare professionals need to use the biomedical literature effectively to identify relationships between biomedical terms and entities. Although a large collection of biomedical literature is indexed in PubMed, the diverse biomedical terminology used in the literature and the massive amount of data presented make the task of information retrieval repetitive and tedious. Researchers usually access the PubMed database through simple keyword searches or with some operational filters, and the search engine essentially displays the results that contain the exact search targets and ranks them by date of publication. Hence, finding comprehensive and contextual information in the large volume of scholarly publications, which is presented as unstructured textual data, remains a significant challenge.</p>
    <p>To date, a handful of knowledge bases have attempted to facilitate the extraction of relevant information regarding, and relationships between, medical concepts (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Some knowledge databases, such as ClinVar (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), PharmGKB (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), and UniProtKB (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), have been manually constructed by domain-expert curators who read a large amount of publications, to disseminate knowledge about genetic entities, such as variants, genes, and diseases. However, this manual curation often suffers from scalability problems due to the recent vast increase in the number of publications (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref>). Indeed, it is nearly impossible for human curators to keep up with all the scientific publications. Also, researchers usually use PubMed queries to identify journal articles relevant to their specific interests. A recent survey of six knowledge bases on cancer genomic variants revealed a highly disparate curation: fewer than 20% of the publications were recorded in at least two of these databases (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). This situation suggests that a literature search engine that employs proper text-mining techniques is needed to obtain a comprehensive coverage of the relevant information.</p>
    <p>In the past decade, the field of biomedical literature mining has yielded great progress in developing text mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques for automated extraction from the biomedical literature (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). For example, LitVar uses named-entity recognition (NER) and named-entity normalization (NEN) methods to match the user input query with the indexed literature for searching publications concerning variants (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In our previous work, we developed variant2literature, which uses the same NER and NEN methods to identify variants from not only the full-text parts of biomedical publications but also the attached supplementary files (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Notably, variant2literature yields more than double the number of search results provided by a LitVar search of our manually curated dataset. Despite LitVar and variant2literature providing results containing the co-occurrence of different entity types highlighted in the texts, the use of the semantic relations between the entities (which is very important information in the biomedical domain) for further filtering the literature has not yet been explored.</p>
    <p>Here, we present pubmedKB, a novel literature search engine that combines a large number of state-of-the-art text-mining tools optimized to automatically identify the complex relationships between biomedical entities—variants, genes, diseases, and chemicals—in PubMed abstracts. We focus on the extraction of biomedical entities that co-occurred in the same sentences in the abstracts. We consider such co-occurrences to be plausible indications of links between entities. Based on these four biomedical entity types (variants, genes, diseases, and chemicals), pubmedKB extracts more than 2 million relationships in the distinct pairs of entities, using its various relation extraction modules. pubmedKB also provides an interactive semantic graph to facilitate visualization and selection of the related entities and singles out of the publications that are relevant to the user query.</p>

      <title>Literature text annotation—biomedical entity extraction</title>
      <p>Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> provides a schematic system overview of pubmedKB. The data in PubMed Baseline 2022, which was released on 12 December 2021, was retrieved from the NCBI’s FTP server to construct pubmedKB at the time of writing on January 2022. The PubMed Baseline 2022 contains about 33 million abstracts. Its entire set of abstracts from journal and book articles is used for text mining (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). The pubmedKB database is currently being updated monthly.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Recognition of entities related to biomedical topics is an essential first step in extracting knowledge from medical papers. The NER task seeks to locate and classify entities mentioned in unstructured text. pubmedKB uses several NLP and deep-learning technologies to extract four biomedical entity types—variants, genes, diseases, and chemicals—from the PubMed abstracts (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). The NER task can be treated as a sequenced labelling problem, in which we first tokenize sentences and then assign a label to each word. We use Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) for tokenization and a combination of the pretrained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining (BioBERT) (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network, based on a previous study (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), to produce a context that provides information on samples surrounding each token. In short, we use NLTK for tokenization and stack a BiLSTM on top of pre-trained BioBERT. The output of the BiLSTM is later fed to a fully connected network, which makes final predictions. The beginning, inside, outside (BIO) format is used for tagging tokens. Detailed descriptions of our NER module are provided in the Supplementary Materials.</p>
      <p>After the NER task, we also need to disambiguate entity mentions recognized by the NER model, since different constructions can represent the same entity (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). For example, ‘coronary heart disease’ and its abbreviation ‘CHD’ should both correspond to the disease with the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) identifier (ID) 68003327. Specifically, we use multitype normalization models from BERN (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) as our NEN module to link mentions to the established databases; and we use tmVar 2.0 (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), GNormPlus (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), sieve-based entity linking (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), and tmChem (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) in BERN to normalize variants, genes, diseases, and chemicals, respectively. With NEN, we aim to give all entities a unique ID, facilitating matching of all the alias names in the literature and in user search terms.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC2-2">
      <title>Relation extraction modules</title>
      <p>The pubmedKB Relation Extraction (RE) module comprises three submodules (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>): the Relational Phrases submodule extracts an open set of relational phrases from free text; the Relational Facts submodule performs sentence classification for a well-defined closed set of relational facts; and the Odds Ratio Info submodule is dedicated to extracting odds ratio statistics for genetic variants and their associated disease phenotypes from clinical trials and meta-analyses.</p>
      <sec id="SEC2-2-1">
        <title>Relational phrases submodule</title>
        <p>We implement two algorithms to identify relational phrases that connect biomedical entities. The first algorithm is based on spaCy (<ext-link xlink:href="https://spacy.io/" ext-link-type="uri">https://spacy.io/</ext-link>), which is an accurate syntactic-dependency syntax parser. Notably, spaCy considers the text's grammatical structure to gain insight into how the words are related to each other. In brief, spaCy generates the dependency tree of each sentence. A triplet (subject, verb, object) is the direct result of spaCy dependency parse. Based on the extracted dependencies, we specifically extract verbs as relations connecting their subject and object entities. For example,</p>
        <disp-quote>
          <p>‘<italic toggle="yes">TCF7L2</italic> <bold><italic toggle="yes">promotes</italic></bold> <italic toggle="yes">pathological retinal neovascularization via ER stress-dependent upregulation of VEGFA</italic>.’</p>
        </disp-quote>
        <p>will be taken as an evidence sentence, based on the ‘<bold><italic toggle="yes">promotes</italic></bold>’ relation between TCF7L2 and retinal neovascularization. However, the writing style used in many scientific articles often contains complex constructions forming long clauses in a sentence. We therefore also use Stanford OpenIE (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), which can extract relational triplets across large clauses. OpenIE splits each sentence into its entailed clauses and then divides these into relational triplets. We select those triplets whose entities correspond to entities extracted by our NER module and filter out redundant short relations. For example,</p>
        <disp-quote>
          <p>‘<italic toggle="yes">ChIP-seq analysis revealed that TCF7L2</italic> <bold><italic toggle="yes">co-localizes with</italic></bold> <italic toggle="yes">HNF4alpha and FOXA2 in HepG2 cells and with GATA3 in MCF7 cells</italic>.’</p>
        </disp-quote>
        <p>will be taken as an evidence sentence for the ‘<bold><italic toggle="yes">co-localizes with</italic></bold>’ relation between TCF7L2 and GATA3.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="SEC2-2-2">
        <title>Relational facts submodule</title>
        <p>Understanding the role of genetic variants (V) in their associated diseases (D) is of great important in clinical practice (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). We therefore deploy a sentence-based relation classifier for a closed set of relations in sentences with variant and disease co-occurrence. We base our model on the R-BERT relation classification framework (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and use a pretrained BioBERT (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) to initialize its encoder. The R-BERT classifier predicts which relational fact is between each variant–disease pair in a sentence.</p>
        <p>Three types of relational facts are specifically defined as Cause-associated, Appositive, and In-patient. A triplet of (V, Cause-associated, D) is extracted for evidence sentences that state that V is causally related to D or is D-associated. Second, the apposition of genetic variants and diseases in a sentence could provide some useful information for clinical interpretations. The triplet (V, Appositive, D) applies to sentences containing expressions such as ‘… the D variant V …’, ‘… V, a D variant, …’, or ‘… novel D mutation V …’. Finally, the triplet (V, In-patient, D) defines sentences reporting D patients that carry V. We provide samples of sentences containing the specific relations for better understanding. For example,</p>
        <disp-quote>
          <p>‘<italic toggle="yes">A comparison of the allele frequencies or genotype distributions by the χ2 test revealed that rs6929846 of BTN2A1 was significantly associated with dyslipidemia (P &lt; 0.05)</italic>.’</p>
        </disp-quote>
        <p>is taken as an evidence sentence for the ‘<italic toggle="yes">Cause-associated</italic>’ relation between rs6929846 and dyslipidemia. The second example of the ‘Appositive’ relation,</p>
        <disp-quote>
          <p>‘<italic toggle="yes">Single-marker analysis revealed significant associations between 2 recently identified candidate schizophrenia susceptibility variants rs1344706 (and rs7597593) and …</italic>.’</p>
        </disp-quote>
        <p>is taken as an evidence sentence for the ‘Appositive’ relation between schizophrenia <italic toggle="yes">and</italic> rs1344706. Finally, as an example of the In-patient relation,</p>
        <disp-quote>
          <p>‘<italic toggle="yes">This is a second missense G564T mutation in another VHL patient from Kuwait that will help expand our knowledge of the VHL gene mutation spectrum in this region of the world</italic>.’</p>
        </disp-quote>
        <p>is taken as an evidence sentence for the ‘<italic toggle="yes">In-patient</italic>’ relation between G564T and VHL, to emphasize the fact that this discovery was made using patient information.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="SEC2-2-3">
        <title>Odds ratio info submodule</title>
        <p>In addition, we use a standalone model that specializes in extracting odds ratio statistics between genetic variants and diseases. We use the pretrained general-purpose sequence-to-sequence model T5 (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) as our base extractor. For example,</p>

      <title>System implementation</title>
      <p>The pubmedKB web server is implemented in NodeJS (<ext-link xlink:href="https://nodejs.org/en/" ext-link-type="uri">https://nodejs.org/en/</ext-link>) using the ExpressJS web development framework. We use the NGINX <ext-link xlink:href="http://HTTP" ext-link-type="uri">HTTP</ext-link> server (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.nginx.com/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.nginx.com/</ext-link>) as a gateway, representational state transfer (REST) application programming interface (API) clients, and the Neo4j graph database server to store the semantic triplets of entity pairs and their relations. Neo4j (<ext-link xlink:href="https://neo4j.com/" ext-link-type="uri">https://neo4j.com/</ext-link>) provides efficient mechanisms for retrieving relations between two entities in a relational database (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). We have built an external entity-mapping API to map user inputs to corresponding BERN IDs and use these IDs to extract the relations and evidence in a sentence from the Neo4j database. The web interface is based on ReactJS (<ext-link xlink:href="https://reactjs.org/" ext-link-type="uri">https://reactjs.org/</ext-link>), a modern JavaScript library, to ensure rapid rendering and high performance. We perform page rendering and reference sorting using a JavaScript object notation (JSON) front-end for better efficiency. The semantic graph is built using the antv graphin library (<ext-link xlink:href="https://graphin.antv.vision/" ext-link-type="uri">https://graphin.antv.vision/</ext-link>) for better visualization. The pubmedKB web server supports all commonly used internet browsers, although we recommend using it with Chrome for the best experience.</p>

      <title>Search bar processing</title>
      <p>For the search bar on the pubmedKB website, we use the same NER and NEN modules to disambiguate alias names in user queries as in journal texts. Search terms, separated by commas, are treated as entity mentions. The NER module classifies their types, and then the corresponding NEN submodules are used to retrieve unambiguous BERN IDs. Finally, we match the query terms and their BERN IDs with entities in pubmedKB to retrieve the relational knowledge and evidence sentences mined from the PubMed abstracts. It should be noted that the search bar is case sensitive, but it includes an auto-suggestion function to help users input the correct names of entities. By default, the search will look for relations with entities of all four types (genes, variants, diseases, chemicals), but the user can specify entity types to search for.</p>

      <title>Relational knowledge extracted from the PubMed abstracts</title>
      <p>The core concept of pubmedKB is that it is an alternative search engine for exploring PubMed abstracts via the extraction of relations mentioned in the literature. Drawing on the data in PubMed Baseline 2022, there are 422 922 unique normalized IDs with relations in pubmedKB, of which about a quarter are single-text mentions, while the rest involve the normalization of several synonymous names by the NEN module. With respect to the semantic relations, there are 1 514 508 OpenIE triplets, 214 870 spaCy triplets, 517 284 R-BERT triplets, and 39 657 odds ratio statistics in pubmedKB. Notably, OpenIE extracts more than 10 times the number of relations that spaCy does. The distribution of the top 50 relational phrases suggests that the two algorithms prefer different sets of relational words (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>; see complete dataset in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Although OpenIE extracts a variety of general words that may express nonrelevant relations, it provides a quality index that indicates to what extent the two entities are written in a well-formed sentence (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In contrast, the relational phrases extracted by spaCy are mostly verb terms that refer to a biomedical action or mechanism. The spaCy results, therefore, are more likely to identify potentially relevant biological relations between entity pairs. Disease type has the most relations with other types of entities in the PubMed abstracts (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Next, we compared the entity pairs in pubmedKB to the corresponding curated PharmGKB knowledge base, which continues to manually curate relevant knowledge concerning the four types of entities. Overall, pubmedKB achieved an averaged coverage rate of 74.91% of the identified associations in the manually curated entity pairs reported by PharmGKB (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). It is notable that more than 90% of disease-disease, gene-disease, and gene-gene pairs curated in the PharmGKB are presented in the pubmedKB with the supporting sentences and corresponding publications.</p>

      <title>Improvement of R-BERT and odds ratio information extraction for variant–disease relations</title>
      <p>Since genetic variant information is becoming increasingly important for precision medicine, pubmedKB uses two classifiers to extract additional information from sentences in which genetic variants and diseases co-occur (V–D pairs).</p>
      <p>To train the R-BERT model, we manually labelled about 1 500 samples (2:1 train–test split) from ClinVar (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) abstracts and achieved an <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>1</sub> score of 84.1%. We then leveraged iterative teacher–student self-learning with nearly 13 000 unlabelled samples to improve the performance to 91.0%. Our implementation is similar to the techniques described by Xie <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In each retraining iteration, a new model is trained on both the gold and the silver data labelled in the previous iteration by the old model. The main difference from the original image-classification study is that we do not noise the student.</p>
      <p>Since the odds ratio and statistical <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value information are two of the preferred methods for estimating the degree of association between genetic variants and their respective diseases (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), we used the pre-trained T5 model to extract odds ratio information from the sentences in which variants and diseases co-occurred. Notably, to fine-tune T5 for odds ratio statistics, we manually labelled around 3 000 abstracts from ClinVar (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and DisGeNET (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) articles and achieved rouge-1, rouge-2, and rouge-L scores of 93.9%, 93.3%, and 94.0%, respectively.</p>

      <title>User interface and system features</title>
      <p>pubmedKB can be accessed via a simple search and interactive graphical interface (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). After the user inputs a plain text query comprising a single biomedical entity, or two entities separated by a comma, in the search bar (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>), pubmedKB normalizes the query to identify an unambiguous BERN ID to use to retrieve semantic triplets from the pubmedKB Neo4j database. pubmedKB returns two main features. First, for each result, it provides a semantic graph showing the relevant entities and the relational evidence associated with the user query (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). To ensure a good user experience when navigating the semantic graph, only the top 50 relevant entities with the most relations are shown. The four entity types are represented by different colours. The user can click a particular entity to see the relation information specific to that entity. pubmedKB also provides node selection (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>) to allow the selection of entities, which are ranked by the number of relations found for them. At the top of the semantic graph, three relation-filtering options enable the user to easily select the linking entities based on specific relations (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). This is particularly useful for detecting specific types of relations (e.g. Cause-associated relations for variant–disease pairs). Second, pubmedKB provides the list of supporting publications, with their associated relational sentences, in the right panel (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). When the user selects specific linking entities, the publication list will be automatically updated to show only the relevant papers for that linking entity. Of note, all search results (not limited to top 50 entities) including the evidence sentences and PMIDs can be obtained through the Download to explore all the relevant information (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). The user can also sort the publications by relevance, publication date, and impact factor (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>). For each publication, pubmedKB provides the citation information details and a PMID link, which redirects the user to PubMed (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>). In addition, pubmedKB displays one or more snippets highlighting the relational entities as supporting evidence (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref>).</p>

    <title>USE CASES</title>
    <p>Below we demonstrate two scenarios of how pubmedKB may be used by scientists.</p>
    <p>First, the user can query a single entity to find related entities and corresponding publications. For example, if they start by searching ‘rs4961’, pubmedKB returns a semantic graph that displays many related entities extracted from the PubMed abstracts (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). The design of this semantic graph enables the user to navigate related entities easily and select the publications they wish to investigate further. The user can narrow down the entity nodes via the node selection function, by typing in a free-text search box or marking checkboxes (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). They can then click a particular entity node to see the detailed relationships with that entity and the corresponding publications (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). Alternatively, the user can choose specific relations by selecting relational options in the top panel of the semantic graph (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>), and select a particular node to see its relation information (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). After selecting a specific related entity, the user can simply click in the blank area to go back to the previous node selection status and easily navigate to another entity of interest.</p>

(<bold>C</bold>) If the ‘ADD1’ entity is clicked, the relevant relationship details and corresponding publications are shown. (<bold>D</bold>) The relation filters at the top of the graph panel provide edge filters for selecting node entities. (<bold>E</bold>) If ‘hypertension’ is selected by clicking the node, the relationship details and corresponding publications are shown.</p>

      <graphic xlink:href="gkac310fig3" position="float"/>

    <p>Alternatively, users can search for two entities, which must be separated by a comma in the search bar, to query for any relationships between them that are represented in the PubMed abstracts. If the relationships are recorded in the pubmedKB database, pubmedKB will return the relationship details as shown in Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C and E.</p>

  <sec sec-type="discussion" id="SEC5">
    <title>DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>The pubmedKB web server is designed to allow swift exploration of the biomedical concepts in the massive collection of publications in PubMed. For example, when ‘rs4588’ is used as a query input, PubMed and LitVar return 187 and 400 publications, respectively, while pubmedKB returns 55. Although pubmedKB returns fewer results, all 55 publications contain at least one sentence with supporting evidence concerning the relations of rs4588 with other entities.</p>
    <p>For relation extraction, other web servers, such as STRING (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), GeneView (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), and LitVar (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), rely on sentence co-occurrence to infer relations between entities, so their results may include many false positives. Indeed, the NER module in pubmedKB does extract sentence co-occurrences of entity pairs. However, because we have applied advanced text-mining techniques to extract specific types of relations, simple sentence co-occurrences are not included in the results output by pubmedKB, ensuring the high quality of the final results.</p>
    <p>There are several limitations to pubmedKB. First, the semantic evidence used for extracting entity information is bound to the performance of the NLP algorithms. As mentioned previously, we have self-annotated a small batch of publications to improve the performance of the R-BERT and T5 models. Second, inconsistent use of biomedical terms and writing styles may result not only in poor document annotation but also in search queries being matched to the wrong existing entities in the pubmedKB database. Third, pubmedKB endeavours to annotate the large volume of PubMed abstracts, but a search query may nevertheless return no results, either because there are no relations in the PubMed literature or because it is not mentioned in the abstract texts.</p>
    <p>In the future, we hope to extend the current PubMed abstracts dataset to include the PubMed Central full-text articles, although this will require improving the search performance in speed and accuracy to deal with the substantial increase in the size of the dataset.</p>
