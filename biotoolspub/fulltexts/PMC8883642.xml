      <p id="Par1">Identifying genomic regions with hypervariable ChIP-seq or ATAC-seq signals across given samples is essential for large-scale epigenetic studies. In particular, the hypervariable regions across tumors from different patients indicate their heterogeneity and can contribute to revealing potential cancer subtypes and the associated epigenetic markers. We present HyperChIP as the first complete statistical tool for the task. HyperChIP uses scaled variances that account for the mean-variance dependence to rank genomic regions, and it increases the statistical power by diminishing the influence of true hypervariable regions on model fitting. A pan-cancer case study illustrates the practical utility of HyperChIP.</p>

    <title>Background</title>
    <p id="Par2">Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) is the premier technology for profiling genome-wide localization of chromatin-binding proteins, including transcription factors and histones with various modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Besides, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) has been widely adopted for the detection of open chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. As a common computational task for learning from ChIP/ATAC-seq data, identifying genomic regions with significant changes of ChIP/ATAC-seq signal intensities across samples is essential to understanding the epigenetic mechanisms that orchestrate the variation of gene expression program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For this task, there are two major analyses suited to distinct application scenarios. The first one is referred to as differential analysis, in which the label of each sample is clearly defined (e.g., healthy or diseased) and differential ChIP/ATAC-seq signals between different labels are identified by comparing the corresponding samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The second analysis does not require prior knowledge regarding the labels of samples and aims at identifying hypervariable ChIP/ATAC-seq signals across samples, which can then be used as features for the classification of the samples. This analysis is of particular importance in classifying samples of different cancer patients and gaining insights into the epigenetic markers of different cancer subtypes/stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Since the second analysis is intrinsically an unsupervised one, it typically requires many more samples to achieve reliable results compared to the first analysis.</p>
    <p id="Par3">In the early years, the practical applicability of hypervariable analysis was seriously limited by the number of ChIP-seq samples available in a study, and researchers were more inclined to apply differential analysis with a proper experimental design. As a result, a large body of mature computational tools has been developed for differential ChIP-seq analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A contrasting example is the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. As an individual scRNA-seq experiment generates transcriptome profiles of a large number of cells and researchers typically have no detailed prior knowledge about the cell identities, hypervariable analysis has been frequently applied to scRNA-seq data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Accordingly, many computational tools for identifying hypervariable genes (HVGs) from scRNA-seq data and using these genes to classify cells have been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par4">In recent years, with the decrease of sequencing costs, there are more and more large-scale studies in which tens or even hundreds of ChIP/ATAC-seq profiles for different human individuals are generated, and hypervariable analysis is becoming increasingly prevalent in the analysis of ChIP/ATAC-seq data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In particular, hypervariable ChIP/ATAC-seq signals across cancer patients could be potential epigenetic markers of different cancer subtypes/stages, and these markers may serve as therapeutic targets and may contribute to the prognosis of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. To our best knowledge, however, there are currently no such computational tools that are specifically developed for hypervariable ChIP/ATAC-seq analysis.</p>
    <p id="Par5">In many studies, researchers designed their own computational pipelines for calling hypervariable ChIP/ATAC-seq signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], but some of these pipelines failed to take some basic data characteristics into account. For example, sequencing count data are inherently associated with a strong dependence of signal variability on the mean signal intensity, making the ChIP/ATAC-seq signal variability of different genomic regions not directly comparable with each other. Specifically, after a logarithmic transformation, small log-counts tend to have larger variances than large log-counts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. While this mean-variability relationship has been properly accounted for in almost all the tools for calling HVGs from scRNA-seq data, several studies called hypervariable ChIP/ATAC-seq signals by ranking genomic regions based on some variability index without considering its dependence on the mean signal intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Other studies alleviated the influence of the mean-variability trend by applying various practical strategies, such as combining the rankings based on the mean intensities and variances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and making a log-transformation with a large offset count to suppress the large variances of small log-counts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These strategies were effective, but their implementation details (e.g., the exact offset count) and performance highly rely on the specific data set, and thus, their general applicability is questionable.</p>
    <p id="Par6">A more fundamental problem is that, instead of coming up with a probabilistic model to assess the statistical significances of observed ChIP/ATAC-seq signal variability, all these studies ranked genomic regions and selected a certain number or proportion of top-ranked ones as hypervariable regions (HVRs), with the specific number or proportion being determined based on practical experience. In these studies, the numbers and proportions ranged from 1000 to 10,000 and from 1 to 25%, respectively. On the one hand, designing a complete statistical model with <italic>p</italic>-value calculation can increase the adaptivity to various data sets and avoid an arbitrary selection of HVRs. On the other hand, using an ordinary model fitting framework will almost certainly lead to conserved <italic>p</italic>-values and low statistical power for identifying HVRs, since it is difficult to strictly avoid the influence of true HVRs on the fitting process. A previous study of ours has suggested that <italic>p</italic>-values derived from an ordinary parameter estimation framework can hardly bear the strength of multiple testing adjustment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par7">In this study, we present HyperChIP, a statistical method for hypervariable ChIP/ATAC-seq analysis that is aimed at addressing the above concerns. In this method, a variability statistic that has been corrected for the mean signal intensity is used as the key statistic, and specific efforts have been made to increase the statistical power for identifying HVRs. For the latter, HyperChIP selects a subset of genomic regions with relatively low signal intensities for parameter estimation and further employs the winsorization technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] to render the estimation procedure robust to true HVRs. Our empirical observations on various data sets suggest that these low-intensity regions contain only a small proportion of HVRs, which can be effectively handled by winsorization. Applying HyperChIP to several real data sets, of which each comprised ChIP/ATAC-seq profiles of tens of cancer patients, we found that the method can identify hundreds to thousands of significant HVRs at common cutoffs of the BH-adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value, which controls the false discovery rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Further exploration revealed that the identified HVRs tended to be associated with the tumor progression stages of patients. We also observed a systematic difference in variability structure between proximal and distal regions. Specifically, the ChIP/ATAC-seq signal variability in distal regions was considerably higher than that in proximal regions, which was consistent with previous studies showing that the activity of enhancer elements is much more variable across individuals and cellular contexts than is the activity of gene promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. We therefore highlight the necessity of separately dealing with proximal and distal regions in a hypervariable ChIP/ATAC-seq analysis, to avoid the suppression of the statistical power for identifying proximal HVRs.</p>
    <p id="Par8">To demonstrate the practical utility of HyperChIP, we additionally applied it to a pan-cancer ATAC-seq data set, which was generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program and consisted of ATAC-seq profiles of tumors from hundreds of patients across 23 cancer types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Based on the identified HVRs, we investigated the similarity structure among the ATAC-seq profiles. While most of them were well clustered by their cancer types, those of various types of squamous cell carcinoma (SC) tended to be mixed up with each other. We further defined super classes of cancer types based on the similarity structure and identified transcription factors (TFs) specific to each class by applying a motif-scanning procedure on the HVRs. Notably, many of the identified TFs were found to be exclusively expressed in the corresponding classes showing a strong association with either tissue specificity, tumorigenesis, or both. For example, <italic>TP63</italic>, a confirmed oncogene in several SC types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], was identified as the most significant TF specific to the SC class.</p>

      <p id="Par10">To facilitate the understanding of how HyperChIP works, we briefly describe the required input data of it. HyperChIP takes a matrix of normalized log<sub>2</sub> read counts as input. The rows and columns of the matrix correspond to a pre-defined list of genomic regions and a set of ChIP-seq samples, respectively. In this study, we separately compiled a list of regions for each data set. Given a data set, we first called peaks for each sample and merged all the resulting peaks. Broad merged peaks were then divided up into consecutive bins, and narrow ones were left as they were. As for normalization, we constructed a pseudo-reference profile by averaging all the samples and invoked the MA normalization procedure implemented in MAnorm2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] to normalize each sample against it (see the “<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section). Note also that, unless otherwise stated, each hypervariable analysis in this study targeting an individual data set has separately handled proximal and distal regions.</p>
      <p id="Par11">Given a matrix of normalized signal intensities, HyperChIP accounts for the associated mean-variability relationship by applying a gamma family regression method to observed mean-variance pairs. Specifically, it employs a local regression procedure to allow for general mean-variance relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. It can be easily seen that all the three data sets are associated with clear mean-variance dependence, and the specific trend depicted by the fitted mean-variance curve (MVC) varies across the data sets (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1). Then, HyperChIP uses the MVC to derive a scaled variance for each genomic region, which is defined as the ratio of the observed variance to the predicted variance obtained from the MVC (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S2). These scaled variances shall be used for ranking regions and selecting HVRs.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Using scaled variances to rank genomic regions. <bold>a</bold> Scatter plots showing the mean-variance trends associated with different data sets.

      <p id="Par12">To benchmark HyperChIP, we considered several other methods for ranking regions. These methods can be classified into two classes. One class uses some variability statistics to rank regions without taking its dependence on the mean signal intensity into account. Such statistics included the observed (unscaled) variance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], median absolute deviation (MAD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and interquartile range (IQR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. We found that all the methods of this class were associated with a tendency to select regions with low signal intensities as HVRs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S3a). The methods of the other class adopt different practical strategies to account for the mean-variability dependence. We included two methods in this class. The first method, referred to as min-rank, is primarily aimed at selecting regions with both high intensities and high variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It first separately uses the observed mean intensities and the observed variances to sort genomic regions into ascending order. Then, it takes the minimum of the two ranks associated with each region and uses these minima to once again rank the regions. When applying min-rank, we found this method clearly tended to select regions with high intensities as HVRs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S3b). The second method follows a computational pipeline used in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It first derives count per million (CPM) values and applies a log<sub>2</sub> transformation with a moderately large offset. The results are then subject to quantile normalization. For this method, we have separately tried 5 and 10 as the offset value (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S3c).</p>
      <p id="Par13">To assess the rankings of genomic regions provided by each method, we calculated true discovery proportions (TDPs) among top-ranked regions. More specifically, we defined, among proximal regions, true HVRs as those regions that were linked with HVGs, which were identified based on the corresponding RNA-seq data (see the “<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S4). We then plotted the TDP against the number of the top-ranked proximal regions for each method. Compared with the methods that do not consider the mean-variability dependence, HyperChIP achieved much higher TDPs for all the three data sets (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Compared with the methods of the other class, HyperChIP performed better or as well as them depending on the specific data set (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d).</p>
      <p id="Par14">A common downstream analysis based on identified HVRs is to use them as features for the classification of samples, with the hope of revealing the substructure of the samples. In the ATAC-seq data set, the 34 NSCLC patients consisted of 26 LUAD and 8 LUSC (lung squamous cell carcinoma) cases, corresponding to two primary subtypes of NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These subtype labels can be considered the gold standard for evaluating the classifications of the patients. Here, based on the top-ranked HVRs derived by different methods, we performed classifications of the patients into two subgroups (see the “<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section) and assessed the consistency between the classifications and the gold standard by using the adjusted Rand index (ARI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This index has an expected value of 0 for random classifications and is bounded above by 1 for a perfect agreement between two classifications. The relative performance of different methods was similar as in the previous comparison based on HVGs: HyperChIP showed an overall performance better than each of the other methods, especially when it was compared with the methods that do not consider the mean-variability dependence (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, b). Furthermore, the classification results from HyperChIP were very stable across a wide range of numbers of used HVRs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Evaluating the classifications of samples that are based on top-ranked HVRs identified by different methods. <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> For each method applied to the ATAC-seq data set, the ARI is plotted against the number of top-ranked HVRs that are used to classify the ATAC-seq samples.

      <p id="Par20">This low-power problem can be alleviated by selecting a subset of genomic regions with a relatively low abundance of HVRs to estimate the parameters, provided that the selection criterion is statistically independent of the test statistic (i.e., the scaled variance) under the null model. Inspired by the independent filtering strategy designed by DESeq2 for reducing the strength of multiple testing adjustment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], HyperChIP uses the observed mean intensity of each region as its selection criterion. To determine the specific criterion, we first examined how top-ranked HVRs were distributed along the range of mean intensities for each of the three data sets. More specifically, we sorted all regions in ascending order (with respect to the mean intensities) and divided them into 10 equally sized groups. We then calculated the proportion of those regions among each group that were ranked in the top 2000 HVRs. It was found that, among proximal regions, top-ranked HVRs tended to be enriched within the groups with moderately large mean intensities, while for distal regions, they tended to be enriched within the groups with the largest mean intensities (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S5a). We also noticed that previous studies had observed many genes with very stable expression strength across cellular contexts. These genes, referred to as lowly variable genes (LVGs), tended to be related to fundamental or so-called constitutive cellular processes, such as translation and translational elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Since the regions in which ChIP-seq signals have extremely low variability across samples could also lead to the underestimation of <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub>, we examined as well the distribution of top-ranked lowly variable regions (LVRs), namely the regions having the smallest scaled variances (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). For both proximal and distal regions, we found that the top-ranked LVRs tended to be enriched within the groups with the largest mean intensities (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S5b). For all the three data sets, the only exception was that the top-ranked proximal LVRs associated with the Pol II ChIP-seq data set were enriched within the center-right groups as well as within the rightmost group, showing a bimodal distribution profile (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S6).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Selecting a subset of genomic regions and using winsorization for parameter estimation. <bold>a</bold> For the H3K27ac ChIP-seq data set, bar plots show the distributions of top-ranked proximal/distal HVRs along the range of mean intensities.

      <p id="Par21">Based on these observations, we set the default behavior of HyperChIP to using the 10% of regions having the smallest mean intensities for parameter estimation. To further account for the presumably small amount of HVRs and LVRs among these low-intensity regions, HyperChIP integrated the winsorization procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] into the original moment matching method to avoid their influence on parameter estimation (see the “<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section). Using the three data sets as examples, we tried different parameter estimation strategies and compared the resulting <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> estimates. With the subset selection and the use of winsorization, a stepwise increase in the estimated <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> was consistently observed across the data sets (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S5c), suggesting an improved statistical power associated with the model fitted by HyperChIP.</p>
      <p id="Par22">To more directly demonstrate the effect of the modifications made by HyperChIP to the original MAnorm2 method, which does not apply a subset selection and winsorization, we compared the empirical distribution of scaled variances with the null distributions inferred by the two methods. We first paid specific attention to the low-intensity regions selected by HyperChIP for parameter estimation, and we observed that, when applying the original method, most of these regions did not even reach the variability magnitude as suggested by the null distribution (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a), indicating this null distribution was too biased towards large values for sensitive identification of HVRs. In comparison, the null distribution inferred by HyperChIP better matched these regions, especially for the regions with relatively small-scaled variances (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). Accompanying this improved fit to the low-intensity regions was a dramatic change of the overall distribution of <italic>p</italic>-values (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c, d). Specifically, the <italic>p</italic>-values resulting from the original method were generally conserved with no enrichment near 0, while the <italic>p</italic>-values derived by HyperChIP showed clear enrichments at both ends of [0, 1], highlighting improved statistical power for identifying LVRs as well as HVRs. With this improvement, we were now able to detect hundreds to thousands of statistically significant HVRs for each of the three data sets (Tables <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>HyperChIP is associated with an improved statistical power for identifying HVRs. <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> For the 10% of genomic regions having the smallest mean intensities, plotting sample quantiles of the scaled variances against theoretical quantiles of the null distribution inferred by <bold>a</bold> the original method or <bold>b</bold> HyperChIP (i.e., the method labeled as “lower 10% + winsorization”). <bold>c</bold>, <bold>d</bold> The overall distributions of (one-tailed) <italic>p</italic>-values resulting from <bold>c</bold> the original method or <bold>d</bold> HyperChIP</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13059_2022_2627_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p>

For comparison, we also randomly selected a set of other proximal peak regions that matched the number of the HVRs. Compared to the genes linked with these randomly selected regions, from which no significant GO terms were enriched when relatively stringent <italic>p</italic>-value cutoffs were applied, the genes linked with the HVRs/LVRs enriched more terms (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a), suggesting they might be associated with coordinated biological functions. Specifically, the genes linked with the LVRs were enriched for GO terms of constitutive cellular processes, including various histone modifications, tRNA modification, and RNA catabolic processes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S1). Consistently, the LVRs showed clearly higher sequence conservation across species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] than both the HVRs and the randomly selected regions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c). Similar results were also observed when we defined significant distal HVRs/LVRs and selected a set of random distal peak regions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Biological interpretation of HVRs and LVRs. <bold>a</bold> For each gene set, the number of significant GO terms is plotted against the <italic>p</italic>-value cutoff used in the GO enrichment analysis.

      <p id="Par24">In contrast, the genes linked with the proximal HVRs were enriched for GO terms related to lung development, cell differentiation, or the identity of lung cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2). For example, surfactant homeostasis, which is a kind of chemical homeostasis important for the lungs, is a characteristic biological process of alveolar cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], a confirmed cell of origin of LUAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Since alveolar cells become more and more poorly differentiated and gradually lose their cell identity as LUAD progresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], these results implied that the epigenetic heterogeneity at the proximal HVRs across the LUAD patients may be connected with their different tumor progression stages. Following this speculation, we examined the correlations of the H3K27ac ChIP-seq signals in different regions with the histopathological labels of the patients that can reflect their tumor progression stages (see the “<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section), and we observed considerably stronger correlations on the proximal HVRs compared to both the proximal LVRs and the random proximal peak regions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>f). Similar results were also observed on the distal regions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>g). We next evaluated the prognostic associations of different regions by separately performing a Cox regression on the H3K27ac ChIP-seq signal in each region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. It was found that the proximal/distal HVRs were more significantly associated with the survival time of the patients than the proximal/distal LVRs and the random proximal/distal peak regions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S7a, b). Moreover, we performed a hierarchical clustering of the patients by using both the proximal and distal HVRs as features (see the “<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section). The patients were classified into two distinct subgroups, and a significant survival difference was observed between them (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S7c, d).</p>
      <p id="Par25">Genetic variation across individuals has been revealed as one of the causes of the associated epigenetic heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. To explore this relationship, we assessed the enrichment of genetic variants within HVRs. Here, we defined significant proximal and distal HVRs for the ATAC-seq data set and mapped them to the somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) identified for the associated NSCLC patients by the original study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. By random simulation, we observed that both the proximal and distal HVRs contained significantly more somatic SNVs than by chance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>h, i). Similarly, the HVRs showed a significant association with somatic copy number variation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S8). We also obtained a list of germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for the patients and found they were enriched within the HVRs as well (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S9). Among these germline SNPs, we next performed a systematic identification of the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) at which different genotypes were associated with significantly differential ATAC-seq signals in the vicinity (see the “<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section). Owing to the large number of statistical tests and the relatively small sample size, only several significant QTLs were identified after multiple testing adjustments, and most of them were located within the HVRs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S10a, b). For example, the most significant QTL was located within a proximal HVR, and its genotype was significantly associated with the ATAC-seq signal at the HVR as well as the expression strength of the downstream gene (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S10c, d). The most significant distal QTL was located within an HVR as well, and its genotype was significantly associated with both the ATAC-seq signal at the HVR and the expression strength of the nearest gene (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S10e, f). In conclusion, these findings indicated that the epigenetic heterogeneity at the HVRs across the patients was linked with their genetic variation.</p>

      <title>Applying HyperChIP to a large pan-cancer ATAC-seq data set</title>
      <p id="Par26">To illustrate the practical utility of HyperChIP, we applied it to a pan-cancer ATAC-seq data set from TCGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], which comprised ATAC-seq samples of tumor tissues of 410 patients across 23 cancer types (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3). Applying HyperChIP to this data set, we identified 5823 proximal HVRs and 2393 distal ones (BH-adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.1). Based on the ATAC-seq signals in these HVRs, we performed a t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] to dissect the similarity structure among the patients (see the “<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section). Naturally, most of the cancer types were well separated from each other in the two-dimensional t-SNE plot (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a). We indeed, however, noticed a few exceptions. For example, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) and kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), which have the same tissue of origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], were very close to each other in the t-SNE plot. Another similar example was glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and brain lower grade glioma (LGG), both of which were brain cancers. Of note, there were two mixtures of cancer types, both of which involved cancer types of different tissue origins (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b, c). Further, we found that the two mixtures largely corresponded to SC and digestive adenocarcinoma (DIAD), respectively. Specifically, the esophageal carcinoma (ESCA) patients in this data set comprised 12 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESSC) and 6 esophageal adenocarcinoma (ESAD) cases, and the distribution of these two subtypes in the t-SNE plot was very consistent with that of the SC and DIAD classes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d), suggesting the HVRs identified by HyperChIP can contribute to revealing the substructures of individual cancer types. Another example regarded the breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) patients, which consisted of 14 basal and 61 non-basal cases. These two subtypes of BRCA corresponded to two patient clusters that were clearly separated from one another (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S11).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Applying HyperChIP to a TCGA pan-cancer ATAC-seq data set. <bold>a</bold> Two-dimensional t-SNE plot of all patients based on their ATAC-seq profiles of tumor tissues.

      <p id="Par27">Next, we focused on the four super classes of cancer types (i.e., kidney carcinoma, brain cancer, SC, and DIAD) and explored the common properties of each class from the perspective of transcriptional regulators. Technically, we obtained 521 binding motifs of 432 different human TFs from the JASPAR database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and quantitatively inferred the activity of the TFs in each ATAC-seq sample (an individual TF could be associated with multiple motif versions). To achieve that, we first identified the instances of each motif in the genome by employing a motif-scanning routine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Then, for each motif, we took the HVRs containing its instances and used the average ATAC-seq signal across these HVRs (in each sample) as an activity score of the corresponding TF (the ATAC-seq signals in different HVRs had been separately scaled beforehand; see the “<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section). Finally, we identified class-specific TFs by comparing the activity scores derived from each motif between the samples belonging to each class and the other samples, with the application of <italic>t</italic>-tests (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S4). Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>e illustrates several representative (top-ranked) motifs for each of the four classes.</p>
      <p id="Par28">We noticed that a number of the identified class-specific TFs have been reported to have tissue-specific activity in the corresponding organs. For example, <italic>HNF4A</italic> is an important TF linked with the regulation of liver-specific gene expression as well as multiple biological processes in the epithelia of the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In our analysis, both HNF4A and HNF4A.1 were identified as top-ranked motifs for the DIAD class (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>f), of which all the three cancer types originated in organs of the gastrointestinal tract (i.e., the esophagus, stomach, and large intestine). Compared to the other cancer types, ATAC-seq samples of the DIAD and kidney carcinoma classes as well as those of the liver-associated cancer types, including liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), showed clearly higher HNF4A activity scores (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>g). Consistently, based on the matched RNA-seq samples, we found <italic>HNF4A</italic> was expressed almost exclusively in these cancer types (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>h). We further accessed the expression strength of <italic>HNF4A</italic> in tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues of a much larger cohort of cancer patients, by using the GEPIA web server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. A consistent tissue specificity of <italic>HNF4A</italic> was observed in this cohort as well, and we found no systematic differential expression of <italic>HNF4A</italic> between the tumor and matched normal tissues (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>i). Another example was <italic>HNF1A</italic>, a TF specifically expressed in organs of endoderm origin, including the kidneys and almost all the digestive organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. In our analysis, <italic>HNF1A</italic> was identified as a top-ranked TF for the kidney carcinoma class, and both of its activity scores and expression strength showed consistent tissue specificity with its biological roles (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S12a-c). Again, we found no systematic differential expression of <italic>HNF1A</italic> between the tumor and matched normal tissues (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S12d).</p>
      <p id="Par29">By contrast, multiple top-ranked TFs identified for the SC class were common oncogenes shared by the involved SC types. For example, <italic>TP63</italic> has been implicated as an oncogene in several SC types, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], LUSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], and ESSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In our analysis, <italic>TP63</italic> was the top 1 TF for the SC class (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>j). Compared to the other cancer types, the cancer types of the SC class exhibited considerably higher activity scores and expression levels of <italic>TP63</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>k, l). We next examined the expression of <italic>TP63</italic> in the larger cohort of cancer patients. Notably, for each SC type, <italic>TP63</italic> showed significantly higher expression in the tumor tissues than in the matched normal tissues, and such upregulation of <italic>TP63</italic> was not observed in any non-SC cancer types (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>m). These results suggested <italic>TP63</italic> could be a “pan-SC” oncogenic TF. Another example was <italic>TP73</italic>, which ranked second for the SC class. Similar to <italic>TP63</italic>, <italic>TP73</italic> showed systematically increased expression in the tumor tissues of the SC types (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S13).</p>
      <p id="Par30">There was also a third type of class-specific TFs, which was associated with strong tissue specificity as well as significantly differential expression between tumor and matched normal tissues. For example, <italic>RFX4</italic> is a TF specifically expressed in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], and it has been recently revealed to be associated with tumor progression in patients with glioblastoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. In our analysis, <italic>RFX4</italic> ranked first for the brain cancer class (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S14a). Among all the cancer types, <italic>RFX4</italic> was exclusively expressed in GBM and LGG, and its expression in them was significantly higher than in the matched normal tissues (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S14b-d). Together, these results indicated the HVRs identified by HyperChIP can contribute to the identification of regulators pertaining to the heterogeneity across samples.</p>

      <title>Applying HyperChIP to non-cancer data sets</title>
      <p id="Par31">Chromatin states vary extensively even across normal humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. To explore the usefulness of hypervariable ChIP/ATAC-seq analysis in this context, we applied HyperChIP to a CTCF ChIP-seq data set comprising samples of 17 lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from different human individuals, including 6 Caucasian individuals (GM10847, GM12878, GM12890, GM12891, GM12892, SNYDER), 7 Yoruban individuals (GM18486, GM18505, GM19099, GM19193, GM19238, GM19239, GM19240), and 4 individuals from the San population (GM2255, GM2588, GM2610, GM2630) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In total, 364 proximal HVRs and 498 distal ones were identified (BH-adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.1). We then performed principal component analysis (PCA) of the CTCF ChIP-seq samples with all peak regions or only the HVRs as features. Interestingly, it was found that only in the latter case were the LCLs well clustered by their populations of origin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a, b). This finding suggested that the hypervariable CTCF binding signals captured by HyperChIP across the LCLs were useful for dissecting the similarity structure among them.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Applying HyperChIP to non-cancer ChIP/ATAC-seq data sets. <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> PCA results for the CTCF ChIP-seq data set, which comprised samples of 17 human LCLs with different populations of origin.

      <p id="Par32">To illustrate the utility of HyperChIP in analyzing ChIP/ATAC-seq samples from time course experiments, we further incorporated a mouse ATAC-seq data set that profiled the chromatin accessibility in preimplantation embryos at different development stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. In detail, this data set contained 2 biological replicates separately for the 2-cell, 4-cell, and 8-cell embryos and the inner cell masses (ICMs) of the blastocysts, as well as 3 biological replicates for mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs; derived from ICMs). Applying HyperChIP, we identified 303 proximal HVRs and 383 distal ones (BH-adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.1). PCA with these HVRs as features revealed that a large proportion (71.6%) of the ATAC-seq signal variability at these regions was accounted for by the first principal component, which showed a strong association with the development timeline (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c). We then accordingly classified the samples into early-stage (2-cell, 4-cell, and 8-cell embryos) and late-stage (ICMs and mESCs) ones, and the same motif analysis as applied to the pan-cancer ATAC-seq data set was repeated to identify stage-specific regulators (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c, d; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S5). Consistent with the findings in the original study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], both <italic>Rarg</italic> and <italic>Nr5a2</italic> were identified as top-ranked TFs associated with the early stage, and their expression showed a clear and consistent difference between the two stages as well (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>e; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S15a). Another example was the <italic>Obox</italic> family, which is a homeobox gene family and has been implicated in early embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. In particular, it has been found that the transcripts of both <italic>Obox2</italic> and <italic>Obox3</italic> are most abundant in the 1-cell embryos with the abundance decreasing in further development until no expression is observed in the morulae (before the blastocysts), and the expression of <italic>Obox6</italic> is concentrated between the 2-cell embryos and the morulae. For the late stage, both <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Klf4</italic> (known regulators of ICMs and mESCs) were identified as top-ranked TFs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>f). Another example was <italic>Gbx2</italic> (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S15b), which is an upstream regulator of <italic>Klf4</italic> and maintains naïve pluripotency of mESCs by inducing the expression of <italic>Klf4</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Notably, many of the top-ranked TFs associated with the early/late stage showed stepwise decreased/increased activity scores along the development timeline, such as <italic>Obox3</italic> and <italic>Klf4</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>d–f). Together, these observations suggest that applying HyperChIP to samples from a time course experiment contributes to revealing regulators pertaining to the dynamics during the biological process.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par33">Hypervariable ChIP/ATAC-seq analysis plays an essential role in large-scale epigenetic studies, considering its importance in dissecting the similarity structure among samples. In the study, we presented HyperChIP as the first complete statistical tool for the computational task. HyperChIP accounts for the mean-variability dependence intrinsic to count data by fitting an MVC, and it increases the statistical power by selecting a subset of genomic regions with a low abundance of HVRs and LVRs and employing winsorization in the parameter estimation procedure.</p>
    <p id="Par34">The specific hypervariable analysis method directly affects the reliability of various downstream analyses, including the interpretation of HVRs as well as the dissection of the similarity structure among samples. For the LUAD H3K27ac ChIP-seq data set, we found that the HVRs identified by HyperChIP were strongly associated with the different tumor progression stages of patients (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>f, g). Here, we applied each of the methods that were used in benchmarking HyperChIP to this analysis (the same number of top-ranked proximal/distal HVRs as identified by HyperChIP was selected for each method). For these methods, the correlations of selected HVRs with tumor progression stage were either roughly as strong as observed from HyperChIP or weaker (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S16). We also applied these methods to the pan-cancer ATAC-seq data set and repeated the t-SNE analysis as presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a. On the one hand, the two-dimensional t-SNE plots generated by different methods were similar to each other (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S17a-g). Based on the HVRs derived by each method (more precisely, the same principal components as used in the t-SNE analysis), we performed a classification of all samples and assessed their agreement with the cancer type labels by calculating the ARI. The ARI values achieved by different methods were close to each other as well (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S17h). On the other hand, HyperChIP showed better performance in revealing fine structures among the samples. For example, the kidney carcinoma class consisted of KIRC and KIRP samples. These samples were very close together in all the t-SNE plots, but only in the t-SNE plot generated by HyperChIP were the two cancer types clearly separated from each other (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S18a-g). Moreover, we performed classifications specifically for the KIRC and KIRP samples (the same features were used as in the previous classifications of all samples) and found that HyperChIP achieved the highest ARI in separating the two cancer types (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S18h). Similar results were also observed between the GBM and LGG types in the brain cancer class as well as between the colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) types in the DIAD class (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figs. S19, S20).</p>
    <p id="Par35">Throughout the entire study, we have strictly followed the criterion of separately handling proximal and distal regions in all hypervariable ChIP/ATAC-seq analyses. In summary, the variability structure associated with proximal regions differs from that of distal regions in many respects, including the underlying mean-variance trend, the distribution of HVRs along the range of mean signal intensities, and the global variability magnitude. Regarding the mean-variance trend, we have seen that the MVCs fitted for each of the data sets in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> are distinct between proximal and distal regions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1). If we do not separate proximal and distal regions when applying HyperChIP, the MVC fitting procedure will have to compromise between the two classes of regions, which will influence not only the overall rankings of all peak regions but also the rankings within each class. Here, we tried applying HyperChIP to the data sets in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> without separately handling proximal and distal regions. It was found that the rankings of proximal/distal regions became worse with respect to the consistency with HVGs and the resulting classifications of samples (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Note S2.1). We also examined the overall rankings of all peak regions, and we still observed that separating proximal and distal regions can bring an improvement in the performance of HyperChIP (in which case the two classes of regions were ranked together based on their respective <italic>p</italic>-values or BH-adjusted <italic>p</italic>-values; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Note S2.2).</p>
    <p id="Par36">Regarding the global variability magnitude, the ChIP/ATAC-seq signal variability in distal regions is typically higher than that in proximal regions. Here, to provide a clear demonstration of this difference, we design a pipeline for comparing the global signal variability (across a given set of ChIP/ATAC-seq samples) between proximal and distal regions. Technically, we achieve it by comparing the variance ratio factors (denoted by <italic>γ</italic>) separately estimated from proximal and distal regions, while controlling for the MVC and the <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> parameter (refer to the HyperChIP model formulated by Eqs. (<xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>) and (<xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="">2</xref>)). In detail, we first process together proximal and distal regions in the normalization and MVC fitting procedures. Then, we set <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> to positive infinity and apply the winsorization framework (see the “<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section) separately to proximal and distal regions to estimate <italic>γ</italic> (note that no selection of low-intensity regions is made). In this way, the <italic>γ</italic> estimate derived from proximal/distal regions represents the scaling factor of the MVC to reach the variance values observed at proximal/distal regions, and we can effectively compare the global signal variability between proximal and distal regions by comparing the corresponding <italic>γ</italic> estimates. Applying this pipeline, we found that the <italic>γ</italic> estimate derived from proximal regions was smaller than that from distal regions for each of the data sets in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a). We further split the pan-cancer ATAC-seq data set into 23 small data sets corresponding to individual cancer types. Again, we observed a systematic increase in signal variability at distal regions compared to proximal regions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>b). Together, these observations indicated the necessity of separately handling proximal and distal regions in hypervariable ChIP/ATAC-seq analysis.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Comparing the global ChIP/ATAC-seq signal variability in proximal genomic regions with that in distal regions. <bold>a</bold> Comparing the <italic>γ</italic> estimate derived from proximal regions with that from distal regions for each of the data sets in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. <bold>b</bold> Comparing <italic>γ</italic> estimates separately derived from proximal and distal regions for the pan-cancer ATAC-seq data set, which have been split into 23 small data sets corresponding to individual cancer types</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13059_2022_2627_Fig8_HTML" id="MO8"/></fig></p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p id="Par37">HyperChIP has been presented as a complete statistical tool for identifying HVRs on ChIP/ATAC-seq samples. It uses local regression to adaptively capture the mean-variance relationship, which leads to better statistics for ranking HVRs compared to other existing ones. Specific efforts have been made to alleviate the influence of HVRs and LVRs on model fitting, which effectively increases the statistical power of HyperChIP. Case studies indicate that the HVRs identified by HyperChIP not only provide a solid basis to uncover the similarity structure among the involved samples, but can also contribute to the identification of regulators pertaining to the similarity structure when coupled with a motif-scanning procedure.</p>

      <title>Data preprocessing</title>
      <p id="Par38">Processing of the mouse ATAC-seq samples, the RNA-seq samples associated with the data sets in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, and all the ChIP-seq samples used in the study started with raw sequencing reads. We first used Trim Galore (v0.4.4) to trim 3′ ends of reads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Resulting RNA-seq and ChIP/ATAC-seq reads were then aligned to the hg19/mm10 reference genome by STAR (v2.5.1b) and Bowtie (v1.2.2), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. To avoid artifacts from PCR amplification, we kept for each sample at most one read or read pair at each genomic location. The remaining reads or read pairs of each RNA-seq sample were then assigned to UCSC annotated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] by htseq-count (v0.6.1p1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. For the NSCLC ATAC-seq samples, read alignments to hg19 (BAM-formatted files) were directly obtained from the corresponding study. Trimming of reads and removal of duplicates had already been done for these BAM files. For the pan-cancer ATAC-seq data set, a count matrix recording the read counts for each sample at a list of genomic regions was downloaded from the TCGA page <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/ATACseq-AWG">https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/ATACseq-AWG</ext-link>.</p>
      <p id="Par39">For the pan-cancer and mouse ATAC-seq data sets, the associated gene expression values, which were respectively CPM and FPKM values derived from RNA-seq data, were directly obtained from the corresponding studies. Accompanying input samples measuring background signals were available for all the ChIP-seq samples and were processed in the same way as were the ChIP-seq samples.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec12">
      <title>Processing read alignments and calling peaks</title>
      <p id="Par40">For paired-end ChIP-seq and input samples, we converted each read pair into a single read whose 5′ end lay upstream of the associated DNA fragment center by 100 bp, with the fragment center inferred as the midpoint between the two 5′ ends of the read pair. For ATAC-seq read alignments, we shifted upstream each individual read by 100 bp. The whole process was for making the 5′ ends of all the resulting reads lie upstream of the presumed protein binding sites by a fixed distance.</p>
      <p id="Par41">Peak calling for each ChIP-seq sample was then performed against the corresponding input sample by using MACS (v1.4.2), with the parameters “--nomodel --shiftsize=100 --keep-dup=all” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. For the NSCLC ATAC-seq samples, peaks were directly obtained from the corresponding study. For the mouse ATAC-seq samples, we used MACS (v1.4.2) with the same parameters, except that no input samples were provided. We also assessed the quality of each data set based on the distributions of peak numbers and fractions of reads in peaks (FRiPs) (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Note S3 for details).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec13">
      <title>Input matrices for normalization</title>
      <p id="Par42">A count matrix and an occupancy matrix have been constructed for each data set. Rows and columns of both matrices corresponded to a list of genomic regions and the related ChIP/ATAC-seq samples, respectively. The count matrix recorded raw read counts. The occupancy matrix used binary variables to indicate whether each region was a peak region in each sample.</p>
      <p id="Par43">For all the data sets but the pan-cancer ATAC-seq one, the count and occupancy matrices were generated by invoking MAnorm2_utils (v1.0.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] with the parameters “--typical-bin-size=X --shiftsize=100 --keep-dup=all --filter=blacklist” (X was set to 2000 and 1000 for the H3K27ac ChIP-seq data set and the other data sets, respectively). The blacklisted regions for hg19/mm10 were obtained from Amemiya et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. For the pan-cancer ATAC-seq data set, the occupancy matrix was determined by considering the regions with &gt; 50 read counts as peak regions.</p>
      <p id="Par44">For the two matrices associated with each data set, we then removed the genomic regions on sex chromosomes to avoid the influence of different biological sexes. We also classified the remaining regions into proximal and distal ones and accordingly split each matrix. Technically, each region with a distance less than 5 kb to any (UCSC annotated) transcription start site was considered proximal, and it was considered distal otherwise (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Note S4 for a detailed discussion of this distance cutoff). Unless otherwise stated, each normalization/hypervariable analysis targeting an individual data set has separately handled proximal and distal regions.</p>

      <title>Applying other methods for ranking HVRs</title>
      <p id="Par57">For the methods that do not consider the mean-variability dependence, the associated variability statistics, including observed variance, MAD, and IQR, were calculated from the same normalized log<sub>2</sub> read counts as used by HyperChIP. For the min-rank method, it was applied to the same normalized data as well. For the method that uses a moderately large offset when applying a log<sub>2</sub> transformation, we followed the computational pipeline presented in the original study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. More specifically, we first derived log<sub>2</sub>-CPM values by using the cpm function of the edgeR package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], with setting log=TRUE and prior.count to a large value (5 or 10 in this study). We then applied quantile normalization to the log<sub>2</sub>-CPM values and calculated the observed variance associated with each region. Finally, these variances were used to rank HVRs.</p>

Technically, we first converted RNA-seq read counts into log<sub>2</sub>-CPM values by using the calcNormFactors and cpm functions of the edgeR package, with log=TRUE for the latter. Then, the standard limma pipeline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] was applied to the log<sub>2</sub>-CPM values, with trend=TRUE for the eBayes function (note that the design matrix contained only an intercept variable). The ratios of sample variances to prior variances were then used as key statistics for identifying HVGs, and we applied a one-sided <italic>p</italic>-value cutoff of 0.05.</p>

      <title>Classification of the NSCLC ATAC-seq samples</title>
      <p id="Par59">Each classification of the samples was performed by using a set of top-ranked proximal/distal HVRs derived by some method as features. For all the methods but the large-offset one, we first separately scaled the normalized log<sub>2</sub> read counts associated with each feature. For the large-offset method, the normalized data bound with it were directly used for the subsequent clustering analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Then, we calculated the Euclidean distance between each pair of samples and performed a hierarchical clustering by using the hclust function of the R software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], with method=“ward.D”. Finally, the resulting hierarchical tree was cut into two branches, and we assessed the agreement of this classification with the subtype labels (LUAD or LUSC) by calculating the ARI, which was achieved by using the adjustedRandIndex function of the mclust package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>].</p>

Enrichments of GO terms were assessed by performing Fisher’s exact tests, with all the proximal H3K27ac peak region-associated genes as background.</p>
      <p id="Par61">For the histopathological labels of the LUAD patients, we first made a classification based on the most prevalent histologic pattern of each patient, which was lepidic, papillary, acinar, or solid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. According to the original study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], we then specified the histopathological labels of the lepidic-prevalent and solid-prevalent patients as low-risk and high-risk, respectively, and the remaining patients were considered median-risk. Finally, we ranked all patients based on their risk levels and quantified the Spearman correlations of H3K27ac ChIP-seq signals in different regions with the risk levels.</p>
      <p id="Par62">We also separately performed a regression of the survival time of the patients on the H3K27ac ChIP-seq signals in each region, by fitting a Cox proportional hazards model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Technically, this was achieved by using the CoxPHFitter function of the lifelines package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>], and we used the (two-sided) <italic>p</italic>-value associated with each model to evaluate the prognostic association of the corresponding region. For the hierarchical clustering of the patients, we followed the same pipeline as used for classifying the NSCLC ATAC-seq samples, except that the proximal and distal HVRs were used together as features. Testing the survival difference between the resulting two subgroups was achieved by using the survdiff function of the survival package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>].</p>

For this analysis, we first noticed that all the SNPs were associated with exactly two different genotypes across the individuals, referred to as reference and alternative genotypes. To increase the statistical power, we filtered out the SNPs whose reference or alternative genotype was associated with less than 5 individuals. Then, for each remaining SNP, we performed a two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test between the ATAC-seq signals (i.e., the normalized log<sub>2</sub> read counts used by HyperChIP) associated with the two genotypes. Finally, the SNPs with a BH-adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value less than 0.1 were considered as significant QTLs.</p>

      <p id="Par69">For the CTCF ChIP-seq data set of human LCLs as well as the ATAC-seq data set of mouse preimplantation embryos and mESCs, PCA was performed based on the same procedure as used for the pan-cancer ATAC-seq data set. For the mouse ATAC-seq data set, the identification of early/late stage-specific regulators was achieved by following the same pipeline as applied to the pan-cancer ATAC-seq data set, except that binding motifs of mouse TFs instead of human ones were used.</p>

(a-c) Scatter plots showing the mean-variance trend (at proximal regions) associated with the H3K27ac ChIP-seq data set as well as the regions that are ranked in the top 1000 HVRs by each method (marked by red points). MAD, median absolute deviation; IQR, interquartile range. <bold>Figure S4.</bold> Identifying HVGs. We have separately identified HVGs for each data set in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, by applying limma-trend to the corresponding RNA-seq data (see Methods in the main text for details). Scatter plots shown here demonstrate the modeling of the mean-variance relationships by limma-trend. Red points in each plot mark the identified HVGs. CPM, count per million; SD, standard deviation. <bold>Figure S5.</bold> Selecting a subset of genomic regions and using Winsorization for parameter estimation. (a) For the ATAC-seq and Pol II ChIP-seq data sets, bar plots showing the distributions of top-ranked proximal/distal HVRs along the range of mean intensities. For each data set, proximal and distal regions have been separately divided into 10 equally-sized groups based on the observed mean signal intensities. (b) Bar plots showing the distributions of top-ranked proximal/distal LVRs along the range of mean intensities. (c) <italic>d</italic>0 estimates resulting from different parameter estimation methods. Inf refers to positive infinity. <bold>Figure S6.</bold> The distributions of top-ranked proximal HVRs and LVRs associated with the Pol II ChIP-seq data set. The top-ranked LVRs form two clusters that are somewhat separated from one another in the mean-variance scatter plot, owing to a gap (indicated by the area circled in green) largely corresponding to the 70th to 90th percentile of mean intensities. As a result, the proportion of the LVRs dips at the corresponding two groups of regions, leading to a bimodal distribution profile as well as a rise in the HVR proportion that is more dramatic compared to the other two data sets. <bold>Figure S7.</bold> Evaluating the prognostic associations of different genomic regions. (a, b) Proximal/distal HVRs are more significantly associated with the survival time of patients than proximal/distal LVRs and randomly selected proximal/distal peak regions. Results shown here are based on the H3K27ac ChIP-seq data set. The <italic>p</italic>-values are derived by separately performing a Cox regression on the H3K27ac level in each region. (c) Dendrogram showing the hierarchical clustering of the patients based on the proximal and distal HVRs. The patients are classified into two sub-groups, labeled C1 and C2. (d) There is a significant survival difference between C1 and C2. <bold>Figure S8.</bold> HVRs have a significant association with somatic copy number variation (CNV). (a, b) Proximal/distal HVRs are more likely to be associated with somatic CNV than randomly selected proximal/distal peak regions. Results shown here are based on the ATAC-seq data set. For this data set, the genomic segments with somatic CNV in at least one patient together occupied almost the whole genome (&gt;95%). We therefore considered a region as associated with somatic CNV only if it overlapped CNV segments in more than 5 patients. 1,000 random simulations were performed separately for proximal and distal peak regions. In each time, we randomly selected the same number of proximal/distal peak regions as that of the proximal/distal HVRs. <bold>Figure S9.</bold> HVRs contain significantly more germline SNPs than by chance. (a) Proximal HVRs identified for the ATAC-seq data set are enriched with germline SNPs. We have performed 1,000 times of random simulation. In each time, a set of proximal peak regions matching the number of the HVRs has been randomly selected. (b) Distal HVRs are enriched with germline SNPs as well. <bold>Figure S10.</bold> Association between QTLs and HVRs. (a, b) Identifying QTLs among the germline SNPs located within ATAC-seq peak regions. Each (BH-adjusted) <italic>p</italic>-value assesses the statistical significance of the association between the genotype of a SNP and the ATAC-seq signal in the peak region containing it. (c) Box plots showing the ATAC-seq signals associated with different genotypes of the most significant QTL, which is located within a proximal HVR. Ref and Alt refer to the reference genotype and the alternative one, respectively. (d) Box plots showing the RNA-seq signals of the downstream gene of the proximal HVR. (e) Box plots showing the ATAC-seq signals associated with different genotypes of the most significant distal QTL, which is also located within an HVR.

We involved the GTEx data because RNA-seq samples for matched normal tissues of GBM and LGG were missing in the TCGA program. <bold>Figure S15.</bold> Examples of stage-specific regulators identified from the mouse ATAC-seq data set. (a, b) Bar plots showing the TF activity scores and expression levels of (a) <italic>Nr5a2</italic> and (b) <italic>Gbx2</italic>, which are top-ranked TFs associated with the early and late stages, respectively.

(a, b) Results shown here are based on the LUAD H3K27ac ChIP-seq data set. For each method, the same number of top-ranked proximal/distal HVRs as identified by HyperChIP are selected. The red dotted line in each plot indicates the median correlation of the HVRs identified by HyperChIP. <bold>Figure S17.</bold> Applying different methods to the pan-cancer ATAC-seq data set. (ag) Two-dimensional t-SNE plots generated by different methods. For each method, the same number of top-ranked proximal/distal HVRs as identified by HyperChIP were used for the downstream PCA and t-SNE analysis (see Methods in the main text). (h) Bar plot showing the ARI values achieved by different methods in classifying all samples. For each method, we performed a hierarchical clustering of all samples based on the same principal components as used in the t-SNE analysis. The samples were then classified into 23 sub-groups based on the resulting hierarchical tree, and the corresponding ARI assessed the agreement of this classification with the cancer type labels. The red dotted line indicates the ARI value achieved by HyperChIP. <bold>Figure S18.</bold> Evaluating the ability of different methods to distinguish between the KIRC and KIRP cancer types.
