    <abstract>
      <p>Thermophilic proteins have important application value in biotechnology and industrial processes. The correct identification of thermophilic proteins provides important information for the application of these proteins in engineering. The identification method of thermophilic proteins based on biochemistry is laborious, time-consuming, and high cost. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a fast and accurate method to identify thermophilic proteins. Considering this urgency, we constructed a reliable benchmark dataset containing 1,368 thermophilic and 1,443 non-thermophilic proteins. A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model based on a multi-feature fusion strategy was proposed to discriminate thermophilic proteins from non-thermophilic proteins. On independent data set, the proposed model could achieve an accuracy of 96.26%, which demonstrates that the model has a good application prospect. In order to use the model conveniently, a user-friendly software package called iThermo was established and can be freely accessed at <ext-link xlink:href="http://lin-group.cn/server/iThermo/index.html" ext-link-type="uri">http://lin-group.cn/server/iThermo/index.html</ext-link>. The high accuracy of the model and the practicability of the developed software package indicate that this study can accelerate the discovery and engineering application of thermally stable proteins.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>In the field of industrial and biotechnology development, researchers usually increase the temperature to shorten the enzymatic reaction time (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2017</xref>). However, the increase in temperature leads to the denaturation of protein, resulting in the loss of protein activity. Maintaining the activity of protein under increasing temperature conditions is a hot topic in the current engineering field. It is well known that temperature is crucial to cellular life. It has been reported that some organisms can live in a high-temperature environment. In general, the organisms that survive at an optimal growth temperature (OGT) below 50°C are regarded as mesophilic organisms, and the organisms that can survive at the OGT of 50°C or above are called thermophilic organisms (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Gromiha and Suresh, 2008</xref>). Thermophiles can produce thermally stable proteins and even effectively resist high temperatures of up to 120°C (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, the study of proteins produced by thermophilic organisms is significant for the development of enzyme engineering (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Huang and Gong, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Alim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Suresh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Zou et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
    <p>There have been many studies on thermophilic proteins. It is found that the thermal stability of proteins is related to amino acid distribution in proteins (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Fukuchi and Nishikawa, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to amino acid distribution, dipeptide composition (DC) contributes effectively to protein thermal stability (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Fang, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Nakariyakul et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, previous studies have reported that the factors affecting the thermal stability of proteins also include hydrophobicity (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Saraboji et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Miyazaki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Gromiha et al., 2013</xref>), hydrogen bonding (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bleicher et al., 2011</xref>), residues and inter-residue contacts (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Gromiha, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Meruelo et al., 2012</xref>), helical polar surfaces (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Jayaraman et al., 2006</xref>), side-chain interactions (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2000</xref>), and salt bridges (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Sadeghi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Ge et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
    <p>Based on these characteristics, some computational models have been developed to predict thermophilic proteins (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Gromiha and Suresh (2008)</xref> developed a neural network-based model. They reported 89 and 91% accuracy using 5-fold cross-validation and independent dataset, respectively. <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Lin and Chen (2011)</xref> built the most reliable benchmark dataset at that time, including 915 thermophilic proteins and 793 non-thermophilic proteins. Using amino acid composition (AAC) and dipeptide composition as inputs of support vector machine (SVM), the accuracy for thermophilic proteins and non-thermophilic proteins was 93.8 and 92.7%, respectively. Then, the genetic algorithm combined with SVM was applied to the prediction problem (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Lv et al., 2020c</xref>). <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Nakariyakul et al. (2012)</xref> established a computational model on the same dataset constructed by <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Lin and Chen (2011)</xref>. Their model achieved an accuracy of 93.3% in jackknife cross-validation. In recent years, combined with AAC, evolutionary information, and acid dissociation constant, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al. (2016)</xref> built a prediction model with an accuracy of 93.5%. <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al. (2017)</xref> proposed a two-steps discrimination method using the same dataset and achieved an accuracy of 94.44% in 5-fold cross-validation. A voting algorithm for thermophilic proteins prediction has achieved an accuracy of 93.03% (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Li J. et al., 2019</xref>). <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al. (2020)</xref> developed a reduced AAC-based model and obtained an accuracy of 98.2%. <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al. (2020)</xref> used the feature dimension reduction technique to identify thermophilic protein and reported an accuracy of 96.02%.</p>
    <p>Although much work has been done to predict thermophilic proteins, the availability of a reliable benchmark dataset, the development of an accurate model based on multi-feature fusion, and the construction of a software package still need to be further improved. Therefore, this study constructed the most reliable benchmark dataset. Subsequently, an accurate model was developed based on this dataset. Based on the model, a software package was established. The following sections will introduce these processes in detail.</p>

    <p>The fundamental framework of the present research work includes the following five steps: (1) benchmark dataset construction, (2) feature extraction, (3) feature selection, (4) feature fusion, (5) model training, and (6) software package establishment. The flow chart of the framework is illustrated in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

      <title>Dataset</title>
      <p>The cornerstone of a robust and reliable model is to generate a reliable and strict benchmark dataset. In previous literature, scholars used 50°C as a cutoff to construct a benchmark dataset. However, this criterion did not seem objective because proteins might be stable even above the OGT of microorganisms. For instance, a protein produced by microorganisms living at 45°C is likely not to denature at 60°C. According to the 50°C cutoff criterion, this protein is included in the negative dataset, but it should be included in the positive dataset as it is still stable above the 50°C. To eradicate this effect as much as possible, we used <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Lin and Chen’s (2011)</xref> strict and objective standard to generate a benchmark dataset. According to <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Lin and Chen’s (2011)</xref> criterion, the proteins in the microorganism with OGT &gt; 60°C and &lt;30°C were regarded as thermophilic and non-thermophilic proteins, respectively. Of course, even after using <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Lin and Chen’s (2011)</xref> criterion, the effect mentioned still exists but not as strongly as when compared to the 50°C cutoff criterion. All protein sequences were extracted from a universal protein resource (UniProt). Subsequently, the following steps were used to ensure the quality of protein data: (I) the proteins which have been manually reviewed remained; (II) proteins containing ambiguous residues were excluded; (III) sequences which are a fragment of other proteins were excluded; (IV) proteins which infer from prediction or homology were excluded; (V) to remove redundancy and homology bias, CD-HIT program (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2010</xref>) was used by setting a cutoff of sequence identity to 30%. As a result, the final benchmark dataset contained 1,443 non-thermophilic and 1,366 thermophilic proteins. Our final dataset contains only a few thousand proteins because the growth temperature of some microorganisms is known (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Li G. et al., 2019</xref>) and UniProt contains few confirmed proteins. We only included experimental data. Moreover, noise and redundancy were removed, which also caused a reduction in the number of proteins. For training model, the dataset was divided into 80:20 ratios; model was trained on 80% dataset and validated on 20% dataset.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="S2.SS2">
      <title>Feature Extraction</title>
      <p>Protein sequences were transformed into numerical vectors to identify thermophilic proteins by machine learning methods (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2021a</xref>,<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). To accomplish this task, we used the iFeature program (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2018</xref>) to generate seven kinds of protein features, namely amino acid composition (AAC), traditional pseudo amino acid composition (tPseAAC), amphiphilic pseudo amino acid composition (aPseAAC), the composition of <italic>k</italic>-spaced amino acid pairs (CKSAAP), dipeptide composition (DC), dipeptide deviation from the expected mean (DDE), and composition, transition, and distribution (CTD). These features will be described in detail in the following sections.</p>

      <title>Feature Selection</title>
      <p>Redundant features and noise affect the prediction performance of the model. In order to get the best prediction performance, it is necessary to remove redundant features and noise using feature selection methods (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Zhang Z. M. et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Dao et al., 2021c</xref>). In this study, the analysis of variance (ANOVA; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2018</xref>) was applied for feature ranking, and a sequential backward selection strategy was used to pick out optimal features. The following section will introduce the method briefly.</p>
      <p>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) can be used to select the best feature subsets based on <italic>F</italic>-value. <italic>F</italic>-value is the ratio of the variance between the sample types and the variance within the samples. A feature’s greater <italic>F</italic>-value implies that the feature can contribute more to discriminating between positive and negative samples.</p>
      <p><italic>F</italic>-value for a feature <italic>m</italic> can be calculated as:</p>

A leaf node is the output of each decision tree. The final output is based on the majority voting system (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Lv et al., 2020a</xref>). If we have attributes Θ of a vector <italic>x</italic> and decision tree based on these attributes is <italic>h</italic>(<italic>x</italic>, Θ), then the random forest can be defined as:</p>

      <title>Performance Evaluation</title>
      <p>For performance evaluation, seven descriptors including AAC, tPseAAC, aPseAAC, DC, DDE, CKSAAP, and CTD were used to create numerical vectors from protein sequences. In order to use these numerical vectors, MLP-based models were trained to evaluate their performances. Results showed that the AUC are 0.9723, 0.9551, 0.9519, 0.8812, 0.9081, 0.9081, and 0.9786 for AAC, tPseAAC, aPseAAC, DC, DDE, CKSAAP, and CTD, respectively (as shown in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In order to remove the redundant features and improve the prediction performance of the model, a feature selection method should be used to pick out the optimal features from each descriptor. In this work, ANOVA was used to rank features for selecting the best feature subsets from the seven types of descriptors. <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> also recorded the performance of each descriptor after feature selection. It showed that AAC, tPseAAC, aPseAAC, DC, DDE, CKSAAP, and CTD produced the best AUC of 0.9735, 0.9580, 0.9610, 0.9143, 0.9165, 0.8349, and 0.9644, respectively. Obviously, the performance of each descriptor increased after the feature selection except the CTD descriptor; therefore, we considered all features of CTD in our study.</p>

      <p>The above results and analysis have demonstrated that each descriptor has useful information to discriminate thermophilic proteins from non-thermophilic proteins. We adopted a feature fusion strategy to include the valuable information of all selected features from each descriptor in model training. In feature fusion, the selected optimal feature subsets of seven descriptors were fused and inputted into the MLP classifier to distinguish thermophilic proteins from non-thermophilic proteins. <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows that the AUC increased to 0.9864, suggesting that feature fusion is very effective and has made an outstanding contribution to improving the model’s prediction performance.</p>

      <title>Comparison to Other Models</title>
      <p>Many models have been proposed for thermophilic protein identification (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Gromiha and Suresh, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Lin and Chen, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Nakariyakul et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Li J. et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2020</xref>). All proposed models were established based on machine learning methods and were evaluated by cross-validation. However, our model was examined on independent data. Moreover, the benchmark dataset used in the present study was rigorous and objective. Moreover, most of these published works did not establish available tools that are not only non-practical but also prevent us from making a fair comparison. The only available web-server for the identification of thermophilic proteins was established by <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Lin and Chen (2011)</xref>. We performed a comparison with the web server using the same validation dataset. Their model (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Lin and Chen, 2011</xref>) displayed 95.30% accuracy, while our model produced an accuracy of 96.26%.</p>

      <title>Feature Analysis</title>
      <p>Our model produces good prediction performance and shows that the characteristics used can effectively characterize thermophilic proteins. Thus, we performed an analysis on features based on their contribution to model performance. In order to find feature contribution, we used permutation feature importance. The contribution of features to the performance of the model is represented in <xref rid="DS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. The following section will analyze the feature of each descriptor briefly.</p>
      <p>The composition and arrangement of amino acids determine the unique function of a protein. At present, the research on thermophilic proteins uses the composition characteristics of amino acids. The current study involves a detailed analysis of AAC. We found that the frequencies of alanine (A), lysine (K), valine (V), isoleucine (I), glutamine (Q), aspartic acid (D), tyrosine (Y), serine (S), glutamic acid (E), and threonine (T) were significantly different between the two classes. It is speculated that these amino acids have crucial information in providing either thermophilicity or non-thermophilicity to proteins. Tyrosine contributed the most to model performance among these amino acids and showed the weight 0.0249 ± 0.0080. Moreover, lysine, glutamic acid, glutamine, and aspartic acid also contributed well to model performance and showed the weights 0.0033 ± 0.0026, 0.0041 ± 0.0017, 0.0036 ± 0.0049, and 0.0162 ± 0.0036, respectively. Glutamate, lysine, tyrosine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid residues were more common in thermophilic proteins than non-thermophilic proteins. Thermophilic proteins contain highly charged amino acids, which contribute to the thermal stability of proteins. Lysine, glutamine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid residues belong to charged amino acids, while tyrosine belongs to polar amino acids. These amino acids participate in forming salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, which provide thermal stability to proteins. These results are consistent with previous studies (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Panja et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
      <p>Valine and isoleucine showed good ability for thermophilic protein identification. In permutation feature importance, valine and isoleucine showed the weights 0.0201 ± 0.0056 and 0.0101 ± 0.0028, respectively. Isoleucine and valine are hydrophobic amino acids. It has been reported that hydrophobicity contributes to the thermal stability of proteins, as during protein folding, hydrophobic amino acids get buried inside the protein to form a hydrophobic core; this hydrophobic core contributes to the thermal stability of proteins (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Baldwin, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Gromiha and Suresh, 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>Amino acid alanine, threonine, and serine indicated an important role in model performance and showed the weights 0.0087 ± 0.0018, 0.0122 ± 0.0045, and 0.0031 ± 0.0039, respectively. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> illustrates the contribution of AAC features to model performance. Non-thermophilic proteins contain more alanine, threonine, and serine residues than thermophilic proteins, consistent with a previous study by <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Cambillau and Claverie (2000)</xref>. Alanine carries less charge, while threonine and serine are neutral amino acids, so these amino acids are rarely involved in forming hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, indicating that the proteins enriched with these amino acids can be prone to thermal denaturation (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Lin and Chen, 2011</xref>).</p>

      <p>Amino acid composition is an excellent descriptor to discriminate thermophilic proteins from non-thermophilic proteins. Previous studies have also confirmed the contribution of AAC to protein classification tasks (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Gromiha and Suresh, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Mahmoudi et al., 2016</xref>). Although AAC plays a good role in protein classification, it also lacks sequence information. The traditional tPseAAC and aPseAAC (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chou, 2001</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) are good options for the lack of sequence information in AAC. <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2011)</xref> and <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. (2016)</xref> also confirmed the critical role of these descriptors in protein classification.</p>
      <p>Both tPseAAC and aPseAAC are used to describe the sequence information of amino acid residues in protein sequence. In tPseAAC, Xc1.K, Xc1.E, Xc1.D, Xc1.Q, Xc1.T, Xc1.A, Xc1.G, and Xc1.S were valuable features with the weights of 0.0045 ± 0.0019, 0.0041 ± 0.0017, 0.0040 ± 0.0029, 0.0036 ± 0.0049, 0.0035 ± 0.0015, 0.0030 ± 0.0029, 0.0026 ± 0.0027, and 0.0018 ± 0.0026, respectively (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). The features Pc1.Q, Pc1.E, Pc1.I, Pc1.T, Pc1.A, Pc1.S, Pc1.G, and Pc1.K in aPseAAC presented important contribution to model performance. They showed the weights 0.0086 ± 0.0030, 0.0081 ± 0.0046, 0.0060 ± 0.0057, 0.0047 ± 0.0030, 0.0047 ± 0.0026, 0.0042 ± 0.0030, 0.0034 ± 0.0023, and 0.0018 ± 0.0014, respectively (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Our in-depth analysis showed that hydrophobic amino acid and polar amino acid based features were more frequent in thermophilic protein, while uncharged and neutral amino acid based features were more frequent in non-thermophilic proteins.</p>
      <p>Dipeptides are also an important feature to distinguish thermophilic proteins from non-thermophilic proteins. Our statistical analysis showed that the occurrence frequencies of KE, LK, EE, EK, AA, LA, KI, IK, KK, and EI have a considerable variance between the two classes of proteins. The ranking of features also confirmed the role of these dipeptides in model performance. Dipeptide KE, LK, EE, EK, AA, LA, KI, IK, KK, and EI showed the weights 0.0113 ± 0.0029, 0.0086 ± 0.0045, 0.0072 ± 0.0019, 0.0070 ± 0.0040, 0.0069 ± 0.0043, 0.0058 ± 0.0010, 0.0043 ± 0.0013, 0.0040 ± 0.0017, 0.0029 ± 0.0026, and 0.0023 ± 0.0017, respectively (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Dipeptide KE, LK, EE, EK, KI, IK, KK, and EI have charged at biological pH, showing a great trend of forming salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, which contributes to the thermal stability of proteins. AA and LA have poor charge capability and were found more in non-thermophilic proteins (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Nakariyakul et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Panja et al., 2020</xref>). Previous studies have also confirmed the role of dipeptide composition in identifying thermophilic proteins (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Gromiha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Lin and Chen, 2011</xref>). MLP model trained on these selected features reveals that these features have good capability to distinguish thermophilic proteins.</p>
      <p>The dipeptide deviation from the expected mean also showed meaningful information for the identification of thermophilic proteins. Features including EE, AA, and KE deviation from expected mean showed good ability to identify thermophilic proteins (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The dipeptide deviation for EE, AA, and KE showed the weights 0.0098 ± 0.0032, 0.0039 ± 0.0028, and 0.0025 ± 0.0012, respectively (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Previous studies have also reported the effective contribution of dipeptide deviating from the expected mean in protein classification tasks (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Saravanan and Gautham, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Ho Thanh Lam et al., 2020</xref>). In addition to these dipeptide-related descriptors, we also considered the composition of <italic>k</italic>-spaced amino acid pairs, representing the paired amino acid frequency separated by any other amino acid. It is a valuable descriptor and has been widely used in previous studies for protein classification (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Jang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Ju and Wang, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Zhang L. et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Zulfiqar et al., 2021b</xref>). In the present study, E<sup>∗∗</sup>K, E<sup>∗∗∗</sup>K, A<sup>∗∗</sup>A, and A<sup>∗</sup>A were found to be containing meaningful information for thermophilic protein identification and showed the weight 0.0077 ± 0.0041, 0.0057 ± 0.0014, 0.0031 ± 0.0034, and 0.0028 ± 0.0015, respectively (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
      <p>Composition, transition, and distribution involves the composition, transition, and distribution of hydrophobic, polar, and neutral residues. Like other descriptors, the hydrophobic and polar residue-based features of CTD were more frequent in thermophilic proteins while neutral residues-based features were more frequent in non-thermophilic proteins. Permutation feature importance of descriptor CTD is represented in <xref rid="DS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>. In previous studies, the CTD has been extensively used for protein classification purposes. <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2011)</xref> and <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Zulfiqar et al. (2021b)</xref> also reported CTD as a valuable descriptor for thermophilic protein identification. In the present study, the CTD showed an excellent capability to identify thermophilic proteins (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). For CTD, all features performed better than the selected features, so we used CTD features without selection. MLP model trained on CTD features performed good results (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

    <p>In addition to proposing a validated model, it is essential to establish a tool to promote the application of the model. To meet this requirement, we established an application software package, iThermo <ext-link xlink:href="http://lin-group.cn/server/iThermo/index.html" ext-link-type="uri">http://lin-group.cn/server/iThermo/index.html</ext-link>. The software package can provide easy access to the model. The software package can be used to make efficient and accurate predictions for thermophilic proteins. It is anticipated that this study will provide a good alternative to laborious, expensive, and time-consuming laboratory practices.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>Thermophilic proteins can withstand the harsh conditions of elevated temperature. Thermophilic proteins have attracted much attention in biotechnology and industrial applications. High temperature leads to protein denaturation, so it is urgent to establish a reliable identification method of thermophilic proteins. The identification of thermophilic proteins based on biochemistry is time-consuming, laborious, and expensive. The computational method-based thermophilic protein identification can provide an attractive choice for rapid, cost-effective, and straightforward identification of thermophilic proteins.</p>
    <p>Considering this urgency, this study constructed a reliable benchmark dataset and used this dataset to train an MLP classifier. The model has good performance on an independent dataset and can accurately identify thermophilic proteins with an accuracy of 96.20%. In order to facilitate access to the model, a software package was also established. The high performance of the model and its availability as flexible packaging can provide a good choice for thermophilic protein study.</p>
