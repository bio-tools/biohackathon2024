        <p id="Par1">Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified genetic susceptible variants for complex diseases. However, the underlying mechanism of such association remains largely unknown. Most disease-associated genetic variants have been shown to reside in noncoding regions, leading to the hypothesis that regulation of gene expression may be the primary biological mechanism. Current methods to characterize gene expression mediating the effect of genetic variant on diseases, often analyzed one gene at a time and ignored the network structure. The impact of genetic variant can propagate to other genes along the links in the network, then to the final disease. There could be multiple pathways from the genetic variant to the final disease, with each having the chain structure since the first node is one specific SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) variant and the end is disease outcome. One key but inadequately addressed question is how to measure the between-node connection strength and rank the effects of such chain-type pathways, which can provide statistical evidence to give the priority of some pathways for potential drug development in a cost-effective manner.</p>

    <title>Background</title>
    <p id="Par17">Over the last decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have achieved remarkable successes in identifying genetic susceptible variants (e.g. SNPs, Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) for a variety of complex traits or diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, the underlying biological pathway mechanism of such association remains largely unknown. Indeed, the genetic variant can act on other molecular traits (e.g. gene expression) and they together weave into one biological network or pathway that contributes to a disease. For instance, the <italic>APOE</italic> gene has been well identified to be associated with Alzheimer’s disease from large scale GWAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], one possible explanation is that the SNP variant in <italic>APOE</italic> can first regulate the <italic>APOE</italic> gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], then act on the production of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, and finally lead to AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par18">Most disease-associated genetic variants from GWAS have been shown to lie in noncoding regions across the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], which provides the clues that regulation of gene expression levels may be the primary biological mechanism through which genetic variants affect complex disease. Certainly, the top GWAS SNP can be also significantly detected due to the linkage disequilibrium with the true causal one, which could be an exonic variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In addition, several expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) studies also illustrate that the expression regulatory information may play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between genetic variants and traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Up until now, there are a few methods to characterize the gene expression that mediates the effect of the genetic variant on complex disease. Huang et al. proposed a model to exploit gene expression to more powerfully test the association between SNPs and diseases by jointly modeling SNPs, gene expressions and diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Recent transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been widely used to integrate the expression regulatory information from eQTL studies with GWAS data to identify gene expression that links the cis-SNPs (SNPs that are within a predefined gene or other well-defined genetic region) and the complex disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Nevertheless, these studies commonly analyzed one gene at a time, while the genetic variant can affect the complex disease through multiple genes and multiple pathways. Park et al. developed the causal multivariate mediation within extended linkage disequilibrium (CaMMEL) method in Bayesian inference framework to select target genes mediating the effect of genetic variants on the complex disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Wei and Li proposed the nonparametric pathways-based regression (NPR) that can consider multiple pathways simultaneously and allow complex interactions among genes within the pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Yao et al. developed a model to quantify the proportion of disease heritability that is specifically mediated in <italic>cis</italic> region by the assayed expression levels of the set of all genes, and of genes in specific functional categories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Indeed, it has been well documented in GWAS that the multiple gene or pathway-based approach can improve power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Although these methods include multiple gene expression in the model, they ignore the complex network structure relationship among genes, which, from the network medicine perspective, is hard to investigate the precise network or molecular pathways involved in complex disease. In fact, one single gene expression can express some mediated effects from the SNP variant to the disease when studying it alone, while this effect could change substantially when studying it within one network or pathway, and vice versa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The focus has been shifted to the identification of pathways.</p>
    <p id="Par58">Often, there could be multiple pathways from the SNP variant to the final disease, with each having the chain structure since the first node is specific SNP variant and the end outcome is the disease. One key but inadequately addressed question is, given such chain pathway, how to measure the connection strength between two nodes and detect whether such pathway is the potential causal one. It is highly desirable to develop statistical methods for ranking the effect of these pathways, providing evidence to give the priority of some pathways for potential drug development and offer drug targets in a cost-effective and timely manner. In the context of systems epidemiology, Ji et al. developed a statistic to test the pathway effect that contributed to a disease with a case-control design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Yuan et al. proposed a novel chi-square statistic to identify whether one chain-type pathway is associated with the final disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, their methods simply use the linear regression to represent the between-node correlation, which is insufficient to capture the complex dependency between the nodes. Furthermore, their methods did not include the outcome variable (complex trait or disease) into the pathway and cannot essentially investigate the pathway mechanism. For example, if there is one potential pathway SNP → gene expression 1 → gene expression 2 → AD, their methods, under linear between-node correlation, can detect SNP → gene expression 1 → gene expression 2 is significantly associated with AD, but failed to determine whether AD is connected to gene expression 1 or gene expression 2. Given that the goal is to rank and quantify the effect of the pathways from the genetic variant to the complex disease, it is intuitively to put such a question into the framework of graph theory once the suitable quantity is found to measure the connection strength between two nodes in the pathway. At present study, we first introduced the maximal correlation coefficient (MCC) to represent the between-node connection, and then integrate MCC with the commonly used K shortest paths algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] in graph theory to rank and identify the potential pathways from genetic variant to disease. We further defined the pathway importance score (PIS) to quantify the importance of each pathway. We termed this method as “MCC-SP”. Various simulations, with different sample sizes and network structures, are conducted to illustrate MCC is better to measure the between-node correlation than other quantities including Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, distance correlation, mutual information, and maximal information coefficient. MCC-SP, as an integration method, has always better and robust performance in identifying the causal pathway from genetic variant to the disease. From the Religious Orders Study and the Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP), we further applied MCC-SP to identify the potential causal pathway from <italic>APOE</italic> genotype to AD through gene expression enriched in Alzheimer’s disease pathway.</p>

      <title>Simulation</title>
      <p id="Par19">Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the simulation results when all the between-node correlations are linear. When the sample size is relatively large (e.g. 300, 500), all methods except MI-SP and MIC-SP have comparable performance as the Pearson-SP, which is the gold standard in such case under both all-right and range-right criteria. When the sample size reduced to 100, the superiority of Pearson -SP is more obvious, though the power of all methods decreases. Figures <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> show the results of all six integration-methods under sample size 500 and 4 different nonlinear correlation patterns being arcuate, cosine, quadratic and mixed pattern. Under the arcuate nonlinear pattern, the MCC-SP performs better than any other method under both criteria regardless of the proportion of nonlinear components (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Note that under the all-right criteria, the other methods are unable to identify the top 4 pathways at all. Under cosine nonlinear relationship, both MCC-SP and DC-SP have comparably better performance than that of the other methods (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b), even when the proportion of nonlinear component reached 60% (Figure S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). However, MCC-SP has the best performance under the all-right criteria when the nonlinear proportion is 30% (Figure S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Similar phenomenon can be found under the sine relationship (Figure S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Under the mixed nonlinear relationship, MCC-SP performs best under both criteria (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c) and have comparable better performance with DC-SP than that of other methods (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). Under the quadratic relationship, MCC-SP still have the best performance than any other methods (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d and Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). The results are consistent under the exponential relationship or the reciprocal relationship (Figure S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>), or when comparing MCC-SP with the nonparametric pathways-based regression (NPR) model (Figure S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>).

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par22">Most disease-associated genetic variants lie in the noncoding regions of the genome and gene expression levels can bridge the gap between genetic variant and disease. Often, there are multiple pathways from the genetic variant to the final disease, we have developed a powerful integration method, MCC-SP, to rank and identify these multiple potential pathways. Various simulations under different sample size and different between-node correlation pattern have shown that the proposed method has better performance than other competing methods. ROSMAP data analysis illustrates that the method can partially detect the mechanism from <italic>APOE</italic> genotype to AD through gene expression enriched in AD pathway. The term “integration” here can be interpreted that we have integrated the suitable between-node correlation with the K shortest paths algorithm in graph theory. MCC-SP is essentially network-based and has different model assumptions from traditional TWAS. Statistically, it will lose efficiency if we know the network structure while ignore it during the inference. In this sense, MCC-SP provided an alternative and complement from TWAS to dissect the pathway mediating the genetic variant and the complex disease. MCC-SP are not only limited to gene expression but can be extended to other molecular phenotypes (e.g. proteomics). Note that the relationship among genes may be a mixture of many possible so called “correlations” rather than endorsed to one of the six suggested functions only. Currently, it is hard to extend MCC-SP to summary-level data. For summary level data, one key step is to calculate the correlation matrix among the genes and the traits. If the correlation is linear, we can implement this using some well-known methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, as we show here, various nonlinear relationships exist and it is hard to calculate the complex non-linear correlation matrix using summary-level data.</p>
    <p id="Par23">ROSMAP data analysis has found that <italic>APOE</italic> genotype is significant associate with AD (<italic>OR</italic> = 2.8849, <italic>P</italic> = &lt; 0.0001), it is reasonable to utilize gene expression enriched in AD disease pathway to rank and identify the potential pathway from <italic>APOE</italic> to AD. We chose the overlapped genes between the ROSMAP data and those located on the AD disease pathway into the analysis. The top 2 pathways have comparable and much higher pathway important scores (PIS) than other pathways, which indicates that these two pathways may play important roles in AD development. The most important pathway identified is <italic>APOE</italic> genotype →<italic>APOE</italic> gene expression→<italic>GRIN2A</italic> → <italic>CAPN2</italic> → <italic>MAPT</italic>→AD. The <italic>APOE</italic> genotype can regulate its gene expression, in the central nervous system (CNS), <italic>LDLR</italic> family is intimately involved in neuronal signal transduction, modulation of ligand-gated ion channels, and regulating neurite outgrowth, synapse formation and neuronal migration. <italic>ApoE</italic> binds to the highly conserved low-density lipoprotein receptor <italic>(LDLR</italic>) family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] including <italic>LRP1</italic> and <italic>ApoER2</italic>, while <italic>ApoER2</italic> was reported to bind <italic>NMDAR</italic> (<italic>GRIN2A</italic> belongs to this family) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The <italic>NMDAR</italic> is a cation channel highly permeable to calcium and plays critical roles in governing normal and pathologic functions in neurons. Calcium entry through <italic>NMDAR</italic> can lead to the activation of the Ca2 + −dependent protease, calpain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Gene <italic>MAPT</italic> belongs to the family of <italic>Tau</italic> and <italic>CAPN2</italic> belongs to the family of <italic>Calpain. Calpain</italic>-mediated tau cleavage can play an important role under neurodegenerative conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. It has been shown that calpain activation results in the generation of several N-terminal tau fragments, which can be detected in mitochondria present in synaptosomal fractions obtained from AD brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In addition, overexpression of <italic>NMDAR2B</italic> in an inflammatory model of Alzheimer’s disease, which can be modulated by <italic>NOS</italic> (<italic>NOS1</italic> belongs to this family) inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Further independent sample validation and experimental study can be conducted to validate these findings.</p>
    <p id="Par24">One limitation of our method is that we assume the network or pathway structure is assumed to be known (e.g. AD pathway in our ROSMAP data analysis). Little attention has been paid on the network structure learning problem, which means determining every between-node link with highest degree of data matching, and often one joint distribution of variables can reflect more than one network structure. Actually, most biologists and clinical researchers usually have some prior on the interplay between the biological components and can depict more or less the specific network or pathway for the corresponding biological process. Meanwhile, numerous databases (e.g. KEGG) can be further borrowed to establish the network structure. Even so, MCC-SP is unable to deal with the loop network. Another limitation is that there is lack of test for the significance of the pinpointed pathway, for example, the proposed method is unable to test whether the order of identified pathways is significant or not. Some nonparametric techniques (e.g. permutation and bootstrap) may be further developed to solve such problems. In practice, once we have obtained the rank of the pathways, one key question is which pathway should be selected for further experimental verification. Here we have provided the PIS to quantify the importance of each pathway, we use <italic>q</italic><sub>50</sub> as the threshold to indicate that those pathways with effect greater than the median value, will have the PIS greater than one. Regardless of the threshold, PIS is essentially the product of the “correlation” along the specific pathway. Indeed, even for two pathways with similar PIS, MCC-SP still give the different ranks. For example, in our real data analysis, the PIS for <italic>Path</italic><sub>3</sub> and <italic>Path</italic><sub>4</sub> are quite close (8.87 vs 8.84). This indicates that these two pathways may have equivalent effect and importance but with different ranks. In practice, we recommend choosing those pathways having comparable PIS with the top one for further experimental verification in a cost-effective manner.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p id="Par25">We proposed an integration method called MCC-SP, identifying the causal pathway effect within a network from genetic variant to the disease. MCC-SP is effective and powerful at identifying the specific pathways contributing that cause disease, and can rank these potential pathways, so it can provide new insights into underlying mechanisms and can provide a more comprehensive approach to studying the effects of specific pathways on disease.</p>

Following previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], if one or both genotypes are ε4, it is assigned to be 1, otherwise it is set to be 0. The gray matter of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of the subject was used to extract RNA from the ROS and MAP cohorts. Agilent Bioanalyzer performs a quality assessment of samples quantified by Nanodrop. The strand-specific dUTP method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] with poly-A selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] was used in the Genomics platform of Broad Institutes for the preparation of RNA-Seq libraries. The quality of the RNA-Seq sample (Bioanalyzer RNA Integrity (RIN) score &gt; 5) and the number threshold (5 μg) requirements were required. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq. Before applying RSEM to estimate the expression levels of all transcripts, the non-gapped aligner Bowtie was used to compare the reads to the transcriptome reference. The result of the data RNA-Seq pipeline is the FPKM value. The quantile normalization method will first be applied to FPKM and subsequently used to eliminate potential batch effect using “<italic>combat</italic>” package.</p>
      <p id="Par52">The study used 364 samples (236 females and 128 males) from ROSMAP, with 163 from MAP and 201 from ROS. The age of death was between 67 and 90 years. Among these samples, 192 samples had AD and 172 were normal controls. We first performed a simple logistic regression between <italic>APOE</italic> genotype and AD (β = 1.0595, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). It is necessary to explore the pathway mechanism behind this association. We mapped all gene expression from ROSMAP to the KEGG Alzheimer’s disease pathway to determine the candidate gene expression. The <italic>APOE</italic> genotype were linked to the three genes <italic>(RTN3</italic>, <italic>ADAM10</italic> and <italic>AOPE</italic>), which located on the left of the Alzheimer’s disease pathway. Then, the other downstream genes are connected following the Alzheimer’s disease pathway structure, and finally connected to AD. There is a total of 24 genes and 26 nodes in the network. The starting node of the whole network is the <italic>APOE</italic> genotype and the terminating node is AD (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).
<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>The whole network from APOE genotype to AD constructed from KEGG-based Alzheimer’s disease pathway. The hypothesis is that the APOE genetic variant can affect AD through the gene expression on Alzheimer’s disease pathway. Multiple pathways with chain structure can be formulated with the staring node APOE genotype and the end node AD. The gene and directions are highlighted with a green frame and a black arrow</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12863_2020_899_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p>
