        <title>Background</title>
        <p id="Par1">Compared with disease biomarkers in blood and urine, biomarkers in saliva have distinct advantages in clinical tests, as they can be conveniently examined through noninvasive sample collection. Therefore, identifying human saliva-secretory proteins and further detecting protein biomarkers in saliva have significant value in clinical medicine. There are only a few methods for predicting saliva-secretory proteins based on conventional machine learning algorithms, and all are highly dependent on annotated protein features. Unlike conventional machine learning algorithms, deep learning algorithms can automatically learn feature representations from input data and thus hold promise for predicting saliva-secretory proteins.</p>

        <title>Results</title>
        <p id="Par2">We present a novel end-to-end deep learning model based on multilane capsule network (CapsNet) with differently sized convolution kernels to identify saliva-secretory proteins only from sequence information. The proposed model CapsNet-SSP outperforms existing methods based on conventional machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, the model performs better than other state-of-the-art deep learning architectures mostly used to analyze biological sequences. In addition, we further validate the effectiveness of CapsNet-SSP by comparison with human saliva-secretory proteins from existing studies and known salivary protein biomarkers of cancer.</p>

      <sec>
        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p id="Par3">The main contributions of this study are as follows: (1) an end-to-end model based on CapsNet is proposed to identify saliva-secretory proteins from the sequence information; (2) the proposed model achieves better performance and outperforms existing models; and (3) the saliva-secretory proteins predicted by our model are statistically significant compared with existing cancer biomarkers in saliva. In addition, a web server of CapsNet-SSP is developed for saliva-secretory protein identification, and it can be accessed at the following URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.csbg-jlu.info/CapsNet-SSP/">http://www.csbg-jlu.info/CapsNet-SSP/</ext-link>. We believe that our model and web server will be useful for biomedical researchers who are interested in finding salivary protein biomarkers, especially when they have identified candidate proteins for analyzing diseased tissues near or distal to salivary glands using transcriptome or proteomics.</p>

  <sec id="Sec1">
    <title>Background</title>
    <p id="Par25">Saliva comes mainly from three pairs of salivary glands (parotid, submandibular and sublingual) and numerous minor salivary glands spread throughout the oral cavity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Similar to other human body fluids, saliva is rich in biomolecules that are secreted by the salivary glands or that leak from nearby tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, biomolecules are released into the blood circulation system by various organs throughout the body and then secreted into saliva [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Thus, the biomolecules in saliva can reflect the health of specific organs, including organs near the salivary glands and distal organs. Previous studies have shown that certain biomolecules may appear in saliva when the patients have oral cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma (HNSCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par26">Accurately measuring and evaluating biomarkers as indicators for differentiating normal and disease samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] is important for detecting diseases, making prognoses, and studying disease occurrence mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. At present, biomarker detection from body fluids such as blood, urine and saliva is an effective method for diagnosing diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Zhang et al. recently proposed a series of prediction methods for secretory proteins and them in plasma, which play a great role in the diagnosis of early cancer and other diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. With the rapid development of <italic>omics</italic> technology, researchers have acquired vast amounts of disease-related data. Therefore, it is desirable to use bioinformatics methods to identify highly sensitive and specific biomarkers from big data. Because there are many signals for various physiological and pathophysiological conditions in blood, most studies on body fluid biomarkers focus on blood biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, saliva is a better source of biomarkers because it is relatively simple in composition and can be easily and noninvasively collected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par27">Many studies have identified biomarkers of various diseases in saliva based on proteomics experiments by performing comparative proteomic analyses of saliva samples from patients with specific diseases and control groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, comparing and quantifying proteome data from saliva samples is challenging due to the large number of sparsely occurring proteins in the saliva, have large dynamic ranges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Due to the limitations of proteomic experimental techniques, the discovery of saliva biomarkers faces many difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Developing a method of accurately predicting human saliva-secretory proteins could solve these problems to some extent. However, few studies have focused on establishing a computational model for predicting human saliva-secretory proteins. The existing studies are based on conventional machine learning methods in which features are selected from feature sets and then classifiers are constructed from training sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore, the results of these methods are largely dependent on the selected features. Compared with conventional machine learning techniques, deep learning methods can automatically learn complex feature representations from raw data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par28">In this study, we propose an end-to-end prediction model based on a deep learning framework that consists mainly of a multilane Capsule Network with differently sized convolution kernels. Our model can accurately identify human saliva-secretory proteins based on only sequence information. A flowchart of our model is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Saliva-secretory protein identification is formulated as a binary classification problem in which each protein is classified as either a saliva-secretory protein or not. The first step involves converting the input protein sequences into evolutionary profile matrices using the Position-specific Iterative Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (PSI-BLAST). To address imbalance issues in the dataset during the training process, the bagging ensemble learning method is applied to the training set. Then, the evolutionary profile matrices of the training set are input into the proposed model to train the model parameters. The proposed model achieves high accuracies using 10-fold cross-validation on the training set and an independent test set (0.905 on training set; 0.888 on independent test set), thus outperforming existing methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] based on traditional machine learning algorithms. By comparing human saliva-secretory proteins detected experimentally by other studies with the results of our model, we find that our model can achieve a true positive rate of 89%. By comparing known salivary protein biomarkers of cancer with the results of our model, we find that our model can achieve an average true positive rate of 88%. A web server is developed for predicting saliva-secretory proteins, which can be accessed at the following URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.csbg-jlu.info/CapsNet-SSP/">http://www.csbg-jlu.info/CapsNet-SSP/</ext-link>. We believe that our predictive model and web server are useful for biomedical researchers interested in finding protein biomarkers in saliva, especially when they have candidate proteins for analyzing diseased tissues near or distal to salivary glands using transcriptome or proteome data. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) a deep-learning-based end-to-end prediction model for identifying saliva-secretory proteins solely from sequence information is proposed; (2) the proposed model performs well and outperforms existing methods; and (3) saliva-secretory protein identification is statistically significant for existing cancer biomarkers in saliva.

In machine learning, the MCC is used as a measure of the quality of binary classifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and has a value between − 1 and + 1, where + 1 represents perfect classification, 0 represents random classification and − 1 signifies total disagreement between prediction and observation. Since accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F-score and MCC are threshold-dependent, a threshold needs to be selected for calculating the specific value. In evaluating binary classifications, MCC produces more informative and truthful scores than accuracy and F-score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Therefore, in this article, the threshold is set where the MCC reaches the maximum value. The ROC curve is a graphical plot that illustrates the classification ability of a binary classifier by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) with various discrimination thresholds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. When using normalized units, the AUC can be between 0 and 1 and represents the probability that a classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative instance. In brief, a larger AUC value indicates better performance. The precision-recall curve is a plot of precision and recall with various discrimination thresholds.</p>

      <title>Evaluating the performance of CapsNet-SSP</title>
      <p id="Par30">To evaluate the performance of CapsNet-SSP, we first generate balanced datasets using bagging ensemble learning. In each iteration of bagging ensemble learning, 350 saliva-secretory proteins and 350 non-saliva-secretory proteins are used to evaluate the performance of the model using 10-fold cross-validation. The performance distribution of the bagging iterations ranges from 0.859 to 0.906 for identifying saliva-secretory proteins and from 0.909 to 0.947 for identifying non-saliva-secretory proteins, which is generally desirable. The average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F-score, MCC and AUC values for 10 iterations of the bagging ensemble learning approach are 0.905, 0.880, 0.929, 0.924, 0.902, 0.810 and 0.930, respectively. To evaluate the performance of CapsNet-SSP against methods based on conventional machine learning, we test all the models on the same dataset.

      <p id="Par31">In addition, to evaluate the performance of the proposed model on the test set, we train the proposed model using bagging ensemble learning over 10 iterations.

      <title>Ranking known cancer biomarkers in saliva</title>
      <p id="Par39">To further confirm the effect of the proposed model on disease marker detection, we also rank the existing cancer biomarkers in saliva. We collect existing biomarkers in saliva from head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma (HNSCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], lung cancer (LC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and breast cancer (BC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par40">Disease biomarkers play an important role in disease detection and the investigation of the mechanisms of disease occurrence and development. In particular, protein biomarkers in biological fluids have the potential to be measured and evaluated as indicators for differentiating normal and disease samples. In recent years, as the level of proteomic analysis has increased, a variety of clinical disease biomarkers have been discovered in body fluids. However, most of these biomarkers are found in blood, and few are detected in saliva. Saliva, as a source for detecting disease biomarkers, has obvious advantages over blood in terms of sample collection and clinical diagnosis.</p>
    <p id="Par41">Many studies have identified biomarkers for various diseases in saliva by comparative proteomic analysis of saliva samples from patients with specific diseases and controls. Comparing and quantifying proteomic data from saliva samples is a challenging task because saliva contains a large number of sparsely occurring proteins with large dynamic ranges that span several orders of magnitude. Consequently, due to the limitations of proteomic experimental techniques, the discovery of salivary biomarkers faces many problems. Thus, developing a method for accurately predicting human saliva-secretory proteins can solve these problems to some extent. However, few studies have focused on establishing computational models for predicting human saliva-secretory proteins, and all of these studies are based on conventional machine learning techniques, in which features are selected from feature sets and classifiers are constructed from training sets.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p id="Par42">In this study, we proposed an end-to-end model based on a deep learning framework that can accurately identify human saliva-secretory proteins solely from the sequence information of amino acids. The model consists mainly of a multilane Capsule Network with differently sized convolution kernels. The first step in constructing the model is to convert the input protein sequences into evolutionary profile matrices using PSI-BLAST. In addition, to address unbalanced dataset issues during training, the bagging ensemble learning method is applied to the training set. Then, the profile matrices of the training set are input into the proposed model to train the model parameters. Finally, the trained model is used to predict saliva-secretory proteins from the test set, and its performance is verified to be better than those of existing methods. Meanwhile, our model can satisfactorily detect the salivary protein biomarkers of cancer. The main contributions of this paper are the proposal of a deep-learning-based end-to-end prediction model that can accurately identify saliva-secretory proteins using only protein sequence information and achieving results that are statistically significant for existing cancer biomarkers in saliva.</p>

    <title>Methods</title>
    <sec id="Sec12">
      <title>Data collection</title>
      <p id="Par43">Several proteins that can be detected in saliva have been either curated in existing databases or reported in the literature. Therefore, we first collect proteins detectable in saliva from the Sys-BodyFluid database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], which contains human body fluid proteins from previous proteome studies. The database includes 2161 proteins in saliva detected experimentally in eight salivary proteome studies. We also gather proteins in saliva from other salivary proteome studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], resulting in 331 and 1166 additional proteins in saliva. Then, we filter these proteins using the data of experimentally validated secretory proteins from the secreted protein database (SPD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], the mammalian protein subcellular localization database (LOCATE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], and the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In addition, to avoid learning bias due to protein redundancies, we remove the proteins that have a mutual sequence similarity above 30% using the CD-HIT tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Finally, 450 proteins remain as the positive data (saliva-secretory proteins), of which 350 proteins are used as a positive training set while 100 proteins are used as the positive test set.</p>
      <p id="Par44">Because no proteins have been clearly reported as non-saliva-secretory proteins, generating the negative data is challenging. In this study, we use a method similar to that proposed by Cui et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], which chooses proteins from the Pfam families that do not contain proteins in the positive data. To reduce the influences of protein families that contain only a small number of proteins, we choose the proteins from families with at least ten proteins. For each family, three members are selected to construct the negative data. We also remove proteins from the negative data that have a mutual sequence similarity above 30% using the CD-HIT tool. As a result, 1850 proteins are selected as the negative data, of which 1750 are used as the negative training set, and the remaining 100 proteins are used as the negative test set.</p>

    <sec id="Sec13">
      <title>Input sequence encoding</title>
      <p id="Par45">A simple and widely used encoding method for protein sequences is one-of-K encoding (one-hot encoding), which consists of a matrix with <italic>N</italic> rows and <italic>K</italic> columns, where <italic>K</italic> is usually the number of amino acid types and <italic>N</italic> is the length of the input protein sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In one matrix, each column corresponds to a type of amino acid, and each row indicates the location in a protein sequence, which is a <italic>K</italic>-dimensional vector with a value of 1 at the index corresponding to the amino acid and a value of 0 at all other positions. However, one-of-K encoding does not consider the evolutionary relationships among proteins. Therefore, in this study, the protein sequences are encoded to evolutionary profiles obtained by searching for the sequence in the ‘Uniref50’ database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] using PSI-BLAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Specifically, the profile of each protein, which is generated using PROFILpro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], is actually a normalized position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] based on the amino acid frequencies at every position of a multiple alignment.</p>
      <p id="Par46">In practice, the sequence lengths of different proteins are different. To reduce the training time, the maximum protein length is set to 1000, and for proteins with lengths less than 1000, the end of the matrix is padded with zeros. When a protein is longer than 1000, 500 amino acids from the beginning (N-terminus) and 500 amino acids from the end (C-terminus) of the protein are selected to avoid the loss of the sorting signals on the N-terminus and C-terminus. According to this rule, only 16.32% of human saliva-secretory proteins are truncated. Because most information on saliva-secretory proteins is stored at the beginning (N-terminus) and the end (C-terminus) of the sequence, this selection will retain the most information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>

      <title>Architecture design</title>
      <p id="Par47">The architecture of the proposed model based on a deep learning framework is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, and the architecture is summarized as follows. The input of the model is a 1000 × 20 normalized PSSM for each protein, which is used as input of the multilane Capsule Network (CapsNet). In this study, the multilane CapsNet contains eight lanes with differently sized 1D convolution kernels, and each CapsNet lane contains a convolutional layer (Conv), a convolutional capsule layer (PrimaryCaps) and a HiddenCaps layer.
<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Architecture of the proposed model</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12859_2020_3579_Fig6_HTML" id="MO6"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par48">The first convolutional layer (Conv) in each lane is designed to increase the representation power of the model. Each of them contains 10 1D convolution kernels of designated size with a stride of 1 and a ReLU activation function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The kernel sizes of the eight lanes are set to 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 21, 27 and 33, respectively. The first convolutional layer in each lane, which also uses the dropout technique with a dropout rate of 0.5 to prevent overfitting and to optimize model generalizability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p>
      <p id="Par49">The PrimaryCaps layer is a convolutional capsule layer proposed by Sabour et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. In this study, the PrimaryCaps layer in each lane is a 1D convolutional capsule layer with 8 channels of convolutional capsules. Each capsule consists of 16 convolutional units, each of which is the result of a size-1 1D convolution kernel with a stride of 9. In total, the PrimaryCaps layer in each lane contains [1000 × 8] capsule outputs (each output is a 16D vector), and each capsule in the [1000 × 1] grid shares its weight with others. Because the capsule length represents the probability of entity presentation, the convolutional units in the capsule layers require different activation functions than those used in convolutional neural networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. The squashing activation function used in the PrimaryCaps layer scales the capsule lengths to [0, 1] as follows:

      <p id="Par50">The HiddenCaps layer in each lane consists of eight 16D capsules that map the input proteins to different states.

      <title>Model training</title>
      <p id="Par51">During model training, all the deep learning models are trained using identical training strategies. The parameters of these deep learning models are optimized using the Adam stochastic optimization method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] with the following parameters: a learning rate of 0.001, a decay rate for the first-moment estimate of 0.9, and an exponential decay rate for the second-moment estimate of 0.999. The applied loss function is cross-entropy loss between the true and predicted distributions of saliva-secretory proteins and non-saliva-secretory proteins. Both the proposed and compared models are executed on a workstation equipped with an Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS operating system, an Intel Core i7-7800X CPU, 128 GB of RAM, and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU. All the deep learning models are implemented using Keras 2.2.4 and TensorFlow 1.13.1.</p>
      <p id="Par52">The dropout, early stopping and regularization strategies are used to prevent overfitting of the complex deep-learning model. The dropout strategy adds multiple dropout layers in the prediction model. During training, samples are taken from different sparse networks of index numbers. During testing, an unthinned network is used with a smaller weight to easily approximate the average of all the thinning network predictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Another strategy used to reduce overfitting is to stop early during training. Specifically, when the validation data loss is not reduced within some preset number of epochs, the training procedure is halted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. The third strategy for preventing overfitting is to use regularization in the deep learning model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. The optimization function contains two items: a loss term, which is used to measure the degree to which the model fits the data, and a regularization term, which is used to measure the model complexity and prevent overfitting. In this study, L2 regularization is adopted to prevent overfitting of the deep learning model.</p>
