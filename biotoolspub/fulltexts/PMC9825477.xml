      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>tRNA molecules contain dense, abundant modifications that affect tRNA structure, stability, mRNA decoding and tsRNA formation. tRNA modifications and related enzymes are responsive to environmental cues and are associated with a range of physiological and pathological processes. However, there is a lack of resources that can be used to mine and analyse these dynamically changing tRNA modifications. In this study, we established tModBase (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.tmodbase.com/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.tmodbase.com/</ext-link>) for deciphering the landscape of tRNA modification profiles from epitranscriptome data. We analysed 103 datasets generated with second- and third-generation sequencing technologies and illustrated the misincorporation and termination signals of tRNA modification sites in ten species. We thus systematically demonstrate the modification profiles across different tissues/cell lines and summarize the characteristics of tRNA-associated human diseases. By integrating transcriptome data from 32 cancers, we developed novel tools for analysing the relationships between tRNA modifications and RNA modification enzymes, the expression of 1442 tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs), and 654 DNA variations. Our database will provide new insights into the features of tRNA modifications and the biological pathways in which they participate.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Transfer RNA (tRNA) is a key molecule in the process of decoding genetic information. tRNA molecules contain dense, abundant chemical modifications and may represent a record of the ancient RNA world (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1–5</xref>). Approximately 400 unique tRNA molecules can potentially be produced in human cells (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). On average, each tRNA carries 13 modification sites (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Moreover, recent studies have shown that tRNA modifications are highly dynamic and show a wide range of responses to cellular metabolite levels and environmental stresses (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9–16</xref>). Furthermore, these changes in tRNA modifications affect tRNA structure, codon recognition, and tRNA-derived small RNA (tsRNA) formation (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17–24</xref>). A growing number of studies have found that alterations in tRNA modifications can cause serious diseases, referred to as RNA modopathies (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). These studies have led a new chapter in tRNA modification research, and future work will surely reveal the mechanisms of dynamic tRNA modifications.</p>
    <p>There are several databases that collect tRNAs or modifications thereof. GtRNAdb (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) is the most comprehensive tRNA database, but it mainly collects the sequences and structures of tRNAs. Similarly, the T-psi-C database (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) focuses on the presentation of tRNA sequences and 3D structures. The Modomics database (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) provides comprehensive information concerning the chemical structures of modified ribonucleosides and their biosynthetic pathways. However, this database mainly includes early published results for individual tRNAs and lacks large-scale tRNA epitranscriptome data. RMBase is a database developed by our team based on high-throughput sequencing data to analyse RNA modifications (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). However, it collects data from genome-wide RNA modification detection techniques, mainly including m6A modifications on mRNAs. These databases are either relatively old or do not specifically focus on tRNA modifications, making it difficult to reveal the full landscape of the tRNA epitranscriptome.</p>
    <p>Several epitranscriptomic technologies have been developed in recent years, which use special library construction strategies and identify tRNA modifications according to reverse transcription (RT) stop and misincorporation signatures (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30–33</xref>). The most recent third-generation single-molecule sequencing strategy allows the direct detection of modifications on RNA molecules (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34–38</xref>). However, current research on tRNA modopathies still faces many difficulties. First, each tRNA sequencing technology identifies tRNA modifications according to a different strategy. For example, QuantM-tRNA-Seq identifies modification sites based on the stop signal of tRNA fragments. mim-tRNA-seq (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) uses the RT misincorporation signature to identify tRNA modifications, while ARM-Seq (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) and DM-tRNA-seq (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) require the comparison of data obtained before and after AlkB treatment to demethylate common modifications in tRNAs. RBS-seq (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), developed based on bisulphite sequencing (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42–45</xref>), utilizes chemical treatment to specifically identify m1A, Ψ and m5C. AQRNA-seq uses exonucleases to remove excess adapters to measure tRNA abundance and modification changes (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The most recent development of Nanopore tRNA sequencing technology (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) allows the direct sequencing of tRNA molecules without reverse transcription steps, but it also produces a large number of miscalls. The differences in these sequencing technologies result in data including modification sites exhibiting completely different characteristics, making it difficult to compare data with each other. Second, the sequences of different tRNA isotypes are very similar, meaning that standard mapping strategies cannot precisely annotate the type of modifications at each site of each tRNA molecule. This can make it very difficult to identify the dynamic changes in these modifications at later stages. Finally, tRNA modifications are influenced by structural changes in tRNAs and differences in the levels of modification enzymes, and they determine the recognition of codons and the processing of tsRNAs (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18–23</xref>). Current tRNA databases cannot store and display these complex factors simultaneously, thus limiting the subsequent resolution of their mechanisms and functions.</p>
    <p>In summary, the detection of tRNA modifications requires specialized library construction strategies and bioinformatic analysis methods to ensure accuracy and high resolution. Based on the above research needs and problems, this study developed tModBase, a specialized resource for deciphering the landscape of tRNA modification profiles from epitranscriptome data.</p>

MG1655), the mature tRNA sequences from GtRNAdb (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) were adapted, and identical sequences were merged at the isodecoder level. We used BLASTN to best match the dot-bracket structure and canonical structure from tRNAdb for each sequence in the tRNA reference library. For species with mitochondrial tRNA, we obtained mitochondrial tRNA reference sequences, dot-bracket structures and canonical structures from mitotRNAdb (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>) or tRNAdb (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). The above steps are performed using the Python script.</p>
      <p>The raw sequencing data were obtained from SRA files obtained with various sequencing technologies in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) database. The RNA-seq transcriptome profiling data of normal tumour samples from 32 cancer types were obtained from the TCGA database, and FPKM values were calculated using counts to represent the gene expression levels of the modification enzyme. RPM values were calculated to represent the expression levels of tRNA molecules. In addition, human (hg38) SNP data were obtained from the dbSNP database (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>).</p>

      <title>Dynamic interaction of tRNA modification positions and corresponding modification enzymes</title>
      <p>A graph of the interaction between tRNA structure and modification is available on the tModBase home page (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Users can intuitively check the modification type of each site in the consensus sequence of human cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs. For example, in human cytoplasmic tRNAs, position 34 is the site with the most abundant modification types, including a total of 20 modification types (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). Additionally, this site corresponds to the wobble position of the mRNA codon, which affects the accuracy of codon recognition and the fidelity of translation. It can also be seen from the figure that whether the tRNA is cytoplasmic or mitochondrial, the most commonly affected modification site is pseudouridine (Ψ), and the bases with this modification are mainly distributed in the anticodon arm structure of the tRNA clover (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>).</p>

      <p>Different types of tRNA modifications are mediated by a variety of RNA modification enzymes (RNA modification proteins, RMPs). tModBase maps the modification types at each site to the corresponding modification enzymes and divides the modification enzymes into writers and erasers. For example, tRNA position 34 may be affected by 15 different writer enzymes (NSUN2, NSUN3, ADAT2, ADAT3, CTU1, CTU2, ELP3, MTO1, QTRT1, WDR6, PUS1, FTSJ1, ALKBH8, GTPBP3 and TRMU) and one eraser enzyme (ALKBH1) (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). Users can easily search for modification enzymes based on the modification of interest and may search for the type and site of tRNA modification affected by a specific enzyme. In addition to the interactive diagram on the home page, users can access and filter more detailed information through three pages: tRNA, Modification, and Enzyme.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the currently known tRNA modification sites in humans and mice are well annotated in tModBase. However, we found that these annotated tRNAs represented only a small fraction of the total tRNA isotypes (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). For example, the human genome contains a total of 432 tRNA loci, encoding 283 different tRNA isotypes, only 54 of which have well-annotated modification sites, accounting for 19% of all isotypes. Thus, the question arises of which sites on the remaining more than 80% of tRNA molecules are likely to contain annotations? We next mine through epitranscriptomic data.</p>

      <title>Mining tRNA modification signals from epitranscriptomic data</title>
      <p>In recent years, a series of tRNA epitranscriptome sequencing technologies have been developed to obtain high-throughput tRNA modification signals. We collected and analysed 103 high-throughput sequencing datasets based on 11 library construction strategies for tRNA quantification and the identification of modification types from species including <italic toggle="yes">Homo sapiens</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Mus musculus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Oryza sativa</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Medicago truncatula</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Solanum tuberosum</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Mycobacterium tuberculosis variant bovis BCG</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). We developed corresponding analysis workflows for different library construction strategies (see Methods), and finally obtained the distribution of the modification signals (misincorporation or termination) in each tRNA molecule (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). tModBase shows the overlapping relationships between the sites of different modification signals and the known modification sites in the molecule in detail. For example, according to the annotation, there is an m1A modification at the 9th site of mt-tRNA-His-GTG. Using mim-tRNA-seq technology (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), it can be observed that this site shows a strong A to T mismatch signal, which is determined by the properties of TGIRT RTase (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60–62</xref>).</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</title>
    <p>Unlike mRNA modifications, modifications on tRNA molecules are abundant and densely distributed. Traditional biochemical methods can identify the types of modifications present on tRNA molecules but cannot perform large-scale batch detection, let alone distinguish multiple tRNA isotypes. In recent years, a series of high-resolution experimental detection methods and bioinformatics analysis procedures focused on tRNA modifications and quantification have been developed. This study integrates and analyses currently reported tRNA epitranscriptome sequencing datasets and demonstrates the misincorporation and termination signals generated by these sequencing technologies in detail (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Additional tRNA molecules likely to contain modifications were identified. Based on the identified misincorporation signals, users can design experiments to further discover new tRNA-modifying molecules and even rare types of modifications. To avoid the problem of false-positives caused by the use of a single dataset, tModBase provides the Mod2Compare tool to compare the differences in the identification signals of the two datasets. It is recommended that researchers use the result obtained from the intersection of multiple datasets as a more credible modification signal for validation.</p>

    </fig>
    <p>Many modifications can cause misincorporation or termination in the RT process, causing the site to generate a detectable signal suggesting that the site is a possible modification site. However, relying on such a signal alone may produce a large number of false-positives, as unmodified bases may also cause misincorporation or termination during the RT process. This is one of the issues that tModBase is trying to address, that is, to provide cross-validation results for multiple datasets to increase accuracy. In fact, there may be multiple reasons for misincorporation or termination, including the library construction method, experimental technique, base type, modification type, tRNA structure, RT enzyme characteristics, or sequencing errors involved. To reflect this information comprehensively, we built a summary table on the position page that shows how many datasets contained a signal at a site, the base type at the site, whether previous studies reported the presence of modifications at the site, the reverse transcriptase used for sequencing, etc. Users can determine the confidence of a modification site based on these features. In the future, researchers can train machine learning models to make more accurate predictions of tRNA modification sites based on the above information provided by tModBase as features.</p>
    <p>In addition, many modification types can lead to incomplete reverse transcription of tRNA and, thus, the lose of this part of the signal, which is also a very important issue. Fortunately, the tRNA sequencing technology collected in tModBase has been designed to address this issue during the library construction process. The basic idea includes three key points: (i) A 3′ adapter is ligated to tRNA 3′ ends. The adapter-ligated tRNA pools are used as templates for primer-dependent cDNA synthesis by TGIRT. (ii) The cDNA is circularized with CircLigase to provide a template for library construction by PCR. (iii) The previously ligated adapter is cleaved using a restriction endonuclease, thus linearizing the circularized RNA again while ensuring that both ends of the target are successfully ligated with the adapter sequences. Hence, the truncated cDNA resulting from the RT stop can also be detected in these libraries. We have summarized a table of the datasets used in tmodBase, describing the library construction strategy for the sequencing data and the reverse transcriptase (RTase) that is used. In the future, researchers can train machine learning models to make more accurate predictions of tRNA modification sites based on the above information provided by tModBase as features.</p>
    <p>Using tModBase, researchers can intuitively observe the signal preferences at known modification sites and correlate them with the corresponding modification enzyme signatures. For example, TGIRT, a reverse transcriptase, can cause an RT misincorporation signal of A to T or G at m1A (determined by the structural properties of the enzyme itself) (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). By summarizing the properties of different reverse transcriptases, researchers can further apply them for the identification of tRNA modification types.</p>
    <p>tRNA modifications change dynamically under different conditions, and earlier studies have detected the tRNA modification changes during cellular changes under stress conditions (imposed by temperature, chemical reagent treatment, etc.) using LC–MS/MS techniques (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S3</xref>) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9–11</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref>,<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). Recent studies using HTS techniques have identified specific tRNA modifications in human and mouse cells that are significantly altered under pathogenic infection (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>) and during T cell activation (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). This evidence implies that dynamic changes in tRNA modifications may be a general response of cells to stress conditions; however, the modifications that can be detected by LC–MS/MS methods cannot clarify the specific tRNA isotypes, and the data obtained from HTS are currently far from sufficient. tModBase will be updated continuously to collect and demonstrate the dynamic changes in tRNA modifications. In the future, we will continue to collect more dynamic modification data generated by HTS and LC–MS/MS methods and add them to tModBase. In addition, we provide a user-submitted data function that allows researchers to upload these data into tModBase if relevant work is published, and we believe that having such a dedicated resource will help advance the field.</p>
    <p>The identification and quantification of tRNA modifications are ultimately aimed at deciphering their mechanisms and functions, but research in this area is just emerging (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). In addition to collecting published reports, tModBase also provides tools such as Enzyme and Mod2tsRNA to correlate tRNA modification with changes in modification enzyme and tsRNA. In the future, researchers can integrate and analyse multiple factors to establish a regulatory network of tRNA modifications, RNA modification enzymes, and tsRNA levels to understand the molecular mechanisms that affect cell function and fate.</p>
    <p>Compared with other tRNA and RNA modification databases focused mainly on tRNA sequences or modifications of other RNA molecules, tModBase has some distinct, important advantages (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The advances in tModBase are as follows: (i) tModBase records 27 types of modifications, including m7G, t6A, Ψ and m1A, at each site in human and mouse tRNA molecules. (ii) We collected 103 datasets from 11 types of high-throughput tRNA sequencing technologies (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) and customized the data according to the applied library construction strategies. The signal of each sequencing technology and its dynamics under different conditions are demonstrated. In addition, tModBase provides tools for cross-sectional comparison between different sequencing results. (iii) tModBase matches the modification at each tRNA site to the expression of the enzyme that mediates that modification and shows the dynamics of these modification enzymes in 32 types of cancers. (iv) tModBase shows the overlap of tRNA modification sites with DNA variations, including SNVs, insertions, and deletions. Users can explore the variation sites corresponding to the modification sites in any tRNA and the associated diseases. (v) tModBase demonstrates the relationship between tRNA modification sites and the production positions of tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs). We provide the Mod2tsRNA tool to analyse the expression levels of tsRNA near tRNA modification sites, which helped to reveal the relationships between tRNA modifications and tsRNA production mechanisms. In addition, tModBase demonstrates the relationships between known tRNA modification sites and tsRNA processing from the published literature. (vi) tModBase includes four types of human diseases caused by aberrant tRNA modifications, including mitochondrial diseases, neurological disorders, cancers, and diabetes, and their associated tRNA molecules, modification types, and modification enzymes. (vii) The analysis results and display charts of all high-throughput sequencing data in tModBase are available for download so that users can conduct in-depth analysis and research based on tModBase.</p>
