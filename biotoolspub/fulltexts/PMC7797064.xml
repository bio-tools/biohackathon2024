      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>DNA strand asymmetries can have a major effect on several biological functions, including replication, transcription and transcription factor binding. As such, DNA strand asymmetries and mutational strand bias can provide information about biological function. However, a versatile tool to explore this does not exist. Here, we present Asymmetron, a user-friendly computational tool that performs statistical analysis and visualizations for the evaluation of strand asymmetries. Asymmetron takes as input DNA features provided with strand annotation and outputs strand asymmetries for consecutive occurrences of a single DNA feature or between pairs of features. We illustrate the use of Asymmetron by identifying transcriptional and replicative strand asymmetries of germline structural variant breakpoints. We also show that the orientation of the binding sites of 45% of human transcription factors analyzed have a significant DNA strand bias in transcribed regions, that is also corroborated in ChIP-seq analyses, and is likely associated with transcription. In summary, we provide a novel tool to assess DNA strand asymmetries and show how it can be used to derive new insights across a variety of biological disciplines.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Even though the DNA double helix is a symmetric structure, many biological processes such as replication, transcription and transcription factor binding are directional. The directionality of these processes results in the inhomogeneous distribution of genomic sequences relative to the two complementary DNA strands. Reflecting directionality biases, strong compositional strand asymmetries have been observed across the entire tree of life, ranging all the way from viral to eukaryotic genomes. This bias has been ascribed to replication origins and transcription initiation sites in all these organisms (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1–6</xref>). In double-stranded DNA viruses, a GC-skew, which measures the asymmetry in the distribution of Gs and Cs in the two strands, has been observed between the leading and lagging strands (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In prokaryotic genomes, genes are more frequently observed in the leading orientation, a phenomenon that is more pronounced for essential genes (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). This asymmetry is in accordance with evidence suggesting that genes in the lagging strand accumulate an excess of mutations relative to those in the leading orientation (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In mammals, the testis expresses the highest number of genes relative to any other tissue. This mechanism safeguards the germline DNA integrity through reduced mutations at the transcribed strand as a result of transcription-coupled repair and in turn leads to reduced population diversity at those sequences (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>
    <p>DNA mutations can be oriented relative to transcription and replication, using as reference the template/non-template and leading/lagging strands, respectively. If the reference nucleotide or motif at the site of the mutation is found more frequently in one strand relative to the other, following correction for background strand preferences, it indicates a mutational strand asymmetry. This mutational strand imbalance can have a major impact on disease, development and evolution. For example, the transcription-coupled repair pathway preferentially repairs DNA damage at the template strand, as it can otherwise impede the RNA polymerase progression (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In lung cancer, tobacco-related carcinogens form bulky adducts at guanines and their preferential repair at the template strand of expressed genes results in mutational imbalance of G&gt;T substitutions (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) is a cytidine deaminase involved in antiviral defense. However, off-target APOBEC-associated mutagenesis in the human genome is often observed in cancer cells and more frequently targets cytosines on the lagging replicative strand (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Transcriptional and replicative strand asymmetries have also been characterized in relationship with gene expression levels and replication timing, providing further mechanistic insights (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref>).</p>
    <p>Sequences that are non-palindromic can be oriented relative to one another. A pair of motifs can be on the same or opposite strands and if they are on opposite strands they can be in convergent (facing each other) or divergent (facing away from each other) orientations. Examples include many transcription factor binding sites. One of the most notable is the CCCTC-binding factor (<italic>CTCF</italic>), the motif orientation of which dictates chromatin looping and three dimensional genome topology (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Another noteworthy example is the Ying-Yang 1 (<italic>YY1</italic>) transcription factor, whose motif orientation in the <italic>c-Fos</italic> promoter reverses the expression of the downstream gene, therefore acting either as an activator or a repressor depending on the genomic orientation of its motif relative to the transcriptional direction (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In transcription factor heterodimers, the orientation of the individual motifs can also influence binding and expression levels (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Other cases of strand asymmetries include endogenous repetitive elements with preferences in their orientation relative to each other and relative to transcriptional and replicative direction, which could influence their jumping activity (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) or the relative orientation of genes and proximal long non-coding RNAs that can regulate the expression of each other. In particular, there is evidence that antisense transcripts can form self-regulatory circuits with the target gene (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p>
    <p>Characterization of strand asymmetries can thus allow for the identification of novel DNA elements, improve our understanding regarding their interactions with one another, and advance our knowledge of the underlying processes in mutagenesis and evolution. To date, there is no versatile tool to perform analysis of strand asymmetries across biological problems. Here, we introduce Asymmetron, a novel, multi-purpose computational toolkit that systematically characterizes strand asymmetry patterns in nucleotide sequences. Asymmetron is composed of four functions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), the first being ‘<italic>consecutive_patterns.py</italic>’ which finds strand patterns within consecutive occurrences of a single genomic element, ‘<italic>contained_asymmetries.py</italic>’ is used for pairs of genomic elements in which one is contained within the other, and ‘<italic>pairwise_asymmetries.py</italic>’ which finds asymmetries between the pairs of proximal genomic elements. The fourth function, ‘<italic>orientation.py’</italic> assigns strand asymmetries from one genomic element to another and can be used to orient features of interest such as Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) peaks or mutations relative to strand-assigned genomic sequences of interest. Using Asymmetron we show that germline structural variant breakpoints can be oriented relative to transposable elements and find transcriptional and replicative strand asymmetries in them, suggesting transposable element activity in the germline. We also provide evidence that the orientation of many transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) is highly biased across promoters and in transcribed regions and validate our findings by analyzing the orientation of TFBSs within ChIP-seq peaks.</p>

        <p>Graphical depiction of Asymmetron functionalities. The Asymmetron toolkit is composed of four functions that enable the estimation of strand asymmetries within and between BED file datasets. The consecutive_patterns.py function enables the identification of patterns within consecutive occurrences of a feature. The contained_asymmetries.py function calculates the strand asymmetries of a feature of interest (motifs) contained within another feature (regions). The pairwise_asymmetries.py function estimates the orientation bias between two features that are in proximity to each other. The orientation.py function orients an un-annotated feature relative to another overlapping feature that has strand annotation; it is integrated within all three other functions and can also run independently.</p>

    <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
    <p>Asymmetron enables versatile genomic investigations of strand asymmetry patterns across different biological problems. It is a Python-based toolkit and its core BED-formatted file comparison functions use the package Pybedtools (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Asymmetron provides support for three types of analyses: (i) consecutive strand asymmetry estimation in a single file with strand annotation; (ii) strand asymmetry estimation of strand-assigned motifs within strand-assigned regions; (iii) strand asymmetry estimation between two strand-assigned motifs in proximity or overlapping each other. A fourth function performs the strand assignment of an unassigned feature based on another overlapping feature, thereby enabling the strand asymmetry analysis of the first (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p>

Because of the directionality of the two strands, we read <italic>B<sub>n</sub></italic> from right to left, e.g. if <italic>B<sub>n</sub></italic> = AG<bold>GCT</bold>, we will say that <italic>B<sub>n</sub></italic> contains the motif TCG. Here, we use ‘motif’ to refer to a short sequence from the same alphabet that is of particular interest.</p>
    <p>Analyses are often performed on genomic data, to extract all locations of a specific motif. In Asymmetron, we use these locations to estimate strand asymmetries through several types of analyses. We use these methods to evaluate strand asymmetries of non-palindromic sequences. To represent the locations of the motif in the genome, it is enough to save the chromosome, the index where the motif starts, the index where the motif ends as well as which strand the motif is found at. A common format used to store this information is a BED file, which, <italic>inter alia</italic>, saves the above mentioned information. In this format, the strand is represented with a + or − sign for <italic>A</italic><italic>n</italic> or <italic>B<sub>n</sub></italic> respectively, which we will also use here. The information of a BED file relevant for our analyses can be represented as a set of vectors <italic>S</italic>, where in each vector chromosome is represented as <italic>c</italic>, start coordinate is represented as <italic>s</italic>, end coordinate as <italic>e</italic> sand sign as <italic>r</italic>.</p>
    <p>The commands used to perform the analyses and the files can be found on the GitHub page (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Ahituv-lab/Asymmetron">https://github.com/Ahituv-lab/Asymmetron</ext-link>).

      <title>Consecutive strand asymmetry estimation for single motifs</title>
      <p>Nearby recurrences of a motif in the genome can have biological significance. To examine the patterns emerging from recurring motifs, we developed this function which allows the observation of consecutive occurrences of a motif. It analyzes whether there is an asymmetry in the number of times the motif appears in one strand versus the other (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).</p>

      <p>The human genome built hg38 was used throughout this work. Gene annotation from GENCODE was used (v33); the file was derived from (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gencodegenes.org/">https://www.gencodegenes.org/</ext-link>) and filtered to include only protein-coding genes (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).

Repli-seq data for the BG02ES cell line were obtained from the ENCODE project (Release 2) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.encodeproject.org/">https://www.encodeproject.org/</ext-link>) (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and lifted over to hg38; leading and lagging orientation of the replication machinery across the human genome was inferred as described in (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Genes were divided into ten equal-sized bins, with an upstream and a downstream 1kB bin added for each gene, resulting in twelve bins. Pearson correlations between transcriptional strand asymmetry of transposable elements and bin number was performed excluding the upstream and downstream 1kB bins. Position frequency matrices (PMWs) of transcription factors were derived from JASPAR (release 2020) for the non-redundant CORE collection (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jaspar.genereg.net/download/CORE/JASPAR2020_CORE_vertebrates_non-redundant_pfms_meme.zip">http://jaspar.genereg.net/download/CORE/JASPAR2020_CORE_vertebrates_non-redundant_pfms_meme.zip</ext-link>) and motif scanning was performed with FIMO using as background model the nucleotide frequencies across the human genome and requiring a minimum <italic>P</italic>-value &lt;10<sup>−6</sup> (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).

    <title>RESULTS</title>
    <p>To illustrate the use of Asymmetron, we carried out analyses, which resulted in novel biological insights: (i) by orienting germline structural variant breakpoints relative to transposable elements we identify transcriptional and replicative strand asymmetries; (ii) we provide evidence that the orientation of a large portion of TFBSs is biased relative to the transcription direction, across the human transcriptome; (iii) we show that closely-spaced homotypic CTCF binding sites are more likely to be in the same orientation; (iv) in addition, we show how to use Asymmetron to detect motif strand asymmetries by using a previously characterized motif bias between the TATA-box and the initiator element.</p>

      <title>Transposable element orientations reveal structural variant asymmetries</title>
      <p>Although strand asymmetries for nucleotide substitutions, insertions and deletions (indels) have been previously characterized using the trinucleotide context of substitutions or the repetitive patterns at the site of indels (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) a strand asymmetry analysis has not been performed for structural variants. Here, we investigated transcriptional and replicative strand asymmetries of three transposable elements, Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs), Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINEs) and Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs). We also oriented population structural variant breakpoints from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) for the likelihood to occur at a particular orientation at each of these repetitive elements.</p>
      <p>We first analyzed the transcriptional strand asymmetry of each of these types of repetitive elements across genic regions using Asymmetron:</p>

          </p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>The strand asymmetry was measured as the ratio of non-template to total occurrences. A ratio above 0.5 reflects a preference of the transposable element for the non-template strand, while a ratio below 0.5 reflects a bias towards the template strand orientation. We found a preference for LINEs, SINEs and LTRs to be at the template strand (ratios 0.392, 0.471, 0.316, respectively, binomial test, Bonferroni corrected <italic>P</italic>-values &lt; 0.001) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32–34</xref>). We also subdivided SINEs into Alu repeats and Mammalian-wide interspersed repeats (MIRs), finding strong transcriptional strand asymmetries only in Alu repeats (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Similarly, we divided LINE retrotransposons in L1 and L2 and found significant transcriptional strand asymmetries in both, which were more pronounced for L1 repeats (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).</p>

      <p>We investigated the transcriptional strand asymmetry of transposable elements as a function of their position in the gene. To perform this, we separated each gene into ten equal-sized bins and added a 1 kB upstream window bin and a 1 kB downstream window bin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). For LINEs and SINEs we found a more pronounced template strand asymmetry bias in regions closer to the TSS, which decreased as a function of distance from it, whereas for LTRs, we could not observe a statistically significant correlation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). We also observed a positive correlation with relative position in the gene and transcriptional strand asymmetry for Alu and L1 repeats, whereas MIR repeats did not display a statistically significant correlation and L2 elements displayed a negative correlation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). These results suggest that transposable elements are preferentially located relative to orientation and position in genic regions.</p>
      <p>Next, we investigated the frequency of structural variants at each of these elements at the template and non-template strand orientations. To perform this analysis, we oriented structural variants relative to endogenous elements:</p>
      <list list-type="simple">

          </p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>After correcting for the background asymmetries of their orientation preferences within transcribed regions, we observed that for LINEs and SINEs there was a significant association between their orientation and the probability of harboring a structural variant breakpoint, with a preference for the template strand (Adjusted transcriptional strand asymmetry ratios of 0.916 and 0.936; binomial test, Bonferroni corrected, <italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.001), while for LTRs we could not find a preference (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). When we subdivided LINE and SINE repeat elements, we found that the structural variant breakpoint transcriptional strand asymmetries were found for L1 and Alu repeat elements (binomial test, Bonferroni corrected, <italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.001), but not for L2 or MIR elements (<italic>P</italic>-value &gt; 0.05) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p>

          </p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>Next, we investigated if the directionality of the replication fork was associated with the orientation of LINEs, SINEs and LTRs and if their orientation also influences the likelihood of observing structural variant breakpoints within those elements. We used Repli-seq data from BG02ES (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), a human embryonic stem cell (ESC) line, to infer the directionality of the replication-fork genome-wide. Similarly to the transcriptional strand asymmetry ratio, the replicative strand asymmetry ratio reflected the occurrences of the transposable elements in the leading orientation over their total occurrences. We found that LINEs and SINEs were more likely to be found in the leading strand orientation (Strand asymmetry: LINEs: 0.524, SINEs: 0.520, binomial test, Bonferroni corrected <italic>P</italic>-values &lt; 0.001), whereas LTRs did not display a significant orientation bias (<italic>P</italic>-value &gt; 0.05) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). For SINEs, we found replicative strand asymmetries at Alu repeats but not at MIR repeats (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). We also separated LINEs into L1 and L2 repeats and found replicative strand asymmetries only for L1 repeats (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).</p>

          </p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>We investigated if the replicative orientation of these endogenous elements was associated with the likelihood of observing germline structural variants. To perform this, we used the structural variant breakpoints that were oriented relative to the repetitive elements and studied their replicative strand asymmetry:</p>

          </p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>We corrected for the background asymmetry in the orientation of each transposable element and investigated if structural variant breakpoints were more likely to be found at a specific orientation. We found that for both LINEs and SINEs there was a significant strand asymmetry with a higher frequency of structural variant breakpoints at the leading orientation (<italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.001), whereas for LTRs no bias was detected (<italic>P</italic>-value &gt; 0.05), (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). We performed the same analysis for LINE and SINE repeat elements and found that the structural variant breakpoint replicative strand asymmetry was found for L1 and Alu elements, but not for L2 or MIR elements (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), similar to our results regarding the transcriptional strand asymmetries.</p>
      <list list-type="simple">

          </p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>We also separated Alu repeats in the three subfamilies (AluJ, AluY and AluS) and L1 repeats in primate-specific (L1P) and mammalian-wide (L1M) and found consistent transcriptional and replicative strand asymmetries in all of them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). However, we only found breakpoint strand asymmetries in AluY and AluS repeats for Alu subfamilies and L1P for L1 subfamilies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>), consistent with previous work indicating that only members of AluY, AluS and L1P subfamilies remain active in the human genome (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). However, we currently cannot rule out the contribution of other mechanisms such as nonallelic homologous recombination contributing to the observed differences at younger repeats and future experimental work is required to provide additional evidence for this.</p>
      <p>Finally, we investigated if the transcriptional and replicative strand asymmetries of transposable elements were dependent on each other or if they were independent contributors. When we controlled for transcription direction and performed the replicative strand asymmetry analysis, the results remained largely unaltered, as was the case when controlling replicative orientation and performing the transcriptional strand asymmetry analysis. These results provide additional evidence that endogenous repeat elements have orientation preferences determined by both replication and transcription.</p>

      <title>Strand asymmetries of TFBSs at promoters and across transcribed regions</title>
      <p>Many regulatory elements are found within transcribed regions. Nevertheless, it remains unknown if the transcription process influences the transcription factor DNA strand regulatory grammar within transcribed regions. Here, we generated a transcriptome-wide map of human TFBSs with FIMO (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) using the JASPAR vertebrate non-redundant list of transcription factors (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). We filtered out transcription factor Position Weight Matrices (PWMs) for which there were no matches meeting the <italic>P</italic>-value threshold, resulting in 551 PWMs, representing a diverse set of transcription factors. We oriented each TFBS occurrence with respect to the transcription direction as template or non-template. As a null hypothesis, we assumed that TFBSs are equally likely to occur at both orientations.</p>
      <p>First, we investigated if the TFBS orientation biases could be identified across transcribed regions (transcription start to transcription end). We found that out of 551 TF PWMs, 248 (45%) displayed significant transcriptional strand asymmetries (binomial tests with <italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.05, Bonferroni corrected) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). To account for the influence of the nucleotide composition in TFBS transcriptional strand asymmetries, we shuffled the order of the rows of each PWM 100 times, from which we estimated the average expected transcriptional strand asymmetries. After correcting for nucleotide composition biases, we found 150 (27%) of transcription factors showed significant transcriptional strand asymmetries, with 73% being shared with our earlier model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1a</xref>). These results indicate that the orientation of TFBSs is not random across transcribed regions.</p>

      <p>We also compared the strand asymmetry bias of each TFBS in the promoter upstream region (−1000 bp to Transcription Start Site (TSS)) and the promoter downstream region (TSS to 1000 bp). We found that on average TFBSs displayed stronger strand asymmetry patterns in the downstream promoter regions; with median absolute orientation biases of 7.14% versus 11.25% in the upstream and downstream promoter regions (Mann−Whitney <italic>U</italic>, <italic>P</italic>-value = 3.1e−9), (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). However, the stronger strand asymmetry patterns for the downstream promoter region relative to the upstream promoter regions were explained by the nucleotide composition restrictions of the first (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1b</xref>). These results are in accordance with the notion that the transcription process imposes restrictions in the orientation preference of TFBSs.</p>

      <p>To provide additional evidence that the observed TFBS strand asymmetries relative to the transcription direction reflect differences in the likelihood of transcription factor binding, we performed an extended analysis using the UniBind dataset. This dataset encompasses ChIP-seq experiments of 231 transcription regulators studied across 315 diverse cell lines and conditions (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). For each ChIP-seq peak in each experiment, the TFBS with the highest binding score and closest proximity to the peak summit for the corresponding transcription factor is selected, generating genome-wide high confidence TFBS maps. Using this dataset, we compared the strand asymmetry of TFBSs upstream and downstream of the TSS.</p>
      <p>We measured the orientation preference of each transcription factor across cell lines and conditions at transcribed regions and found that transcription factors displayed significant orientation preference relative to the transcription direction in ∼20% of ChIP-seq experiments (binomial test with Bonferroni correction, <italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.05). We focused our analysis on the five cell lines with the most experiments available, K562, MCF7, HEPG2, GM12878 and A549. We found that certain transcription factors consistently displayed orientation preference across multiple experiments and across different cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Some of the most pronounced asymmetries included those of RUNX1, SOX2, FOXA1, FOXA2, ZNF384, HNF4A, HNF4G, EGR1, ESRRA, NFYA, NFYB, NFIC, USF1, USF2, E2F4 and KLF4. When we compared ChIP-seq experiments across cell lines for these transcription factors, we found consistency in both the orientation preference and the statistical significance (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">D</xref>).</p>
      <p>We also subdivided the analysis in the promoter upstream region (−1000 bp to TSS) and the promoter downstream region (TSS to 1000 bp). Although we were underpowered, we found that in the promoter upstream region CTCF and CTCFL TFBSs consistently displayed a preference for the non-template strand. In particular, out of 202 ChIP-seq experiments analyzed, 194 of them showed statistically significant orientation preference of the CTCF motif for the non-template strand after multiple testing correction in the promoter upstream region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). In the promoter downstream region, YY1 displayed a preference for the non-template strand with a statistically significant strand asymmetry in 18 out of 19 experiments analyzed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>). For CTCF, we investigated if the observed transcriptional strand asymmetry was influenced by its motif positioning across the gene. We found across ChIP-seq experiments that the bound CTCF motif orientations were influenced by the position in the gene, with a negative correlation relative to bin number from TSS to Transcription End Site (TES) (Pearson correlation, <italic>r</italic> = −0.96, <italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.001) and a non-template strand asymmetry in promoter upstream and transcription termination downstream regions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>). These results confirm our previous findings which showed that transcription factors are not strand agnostic and that orientation relative to the TSS could determine function.</p>

      <p>To showcase how Asymmetron can be used to study the orientation preference of consecutive occurrences of a motif we performed a case study on the CTCF motif. We investigated the orientation bias of high confidence homotypic CTCF motif occurrences across the human genome.

We focused our analysis at regions around the TSS (-1,000bp to +1,000bp). We found that both the orientation and the pairwise distance of the two motifs was highly biased (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4H</xref>) and consistent with the literature (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). In particular, there was a significant bias relative to their orientation with preference for the opposite strand (<italic>P</italic>-value &lt; e−11), which was pronounced at a pairwise distance of 30–50 bp and which disappeared for shorter or longer distances (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4H</xref>).</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>Asymmetron is a multi-purpose toolkit that enables the exploration of strand asymmetries in diverse biological problems. We applied Asymmetron to four different biological problems showing that: (i) germline structural variants are more likely to overlap LINE and SINE transposable elements with particular orientations relative to transcription and replication direction, (ii) 45% of transcription factors show highly biased TFBS orientation preferences relative to transcriptional direction across human genic regions, (iii) orientation bias in homotypic occurrences of nearby CTCF motifs towards the same strand and (iv) motif orientation bias for TATA-box and INR motifs found at the core promoter.</p>
    <p>The observed background asymmetries in the orientation of LINE and SINE transposable elements could have been influenced by the contribution of polyadenylation signals within them through selection pressure, as previously suggested (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In addition, dynamic changes in replication directionality during evolution could explain the weaker strand asymmetry biases observed, relative to transcriptional strand asymmetry biases, especially for inactive transposable elements (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The identification of biases in population structural variant breakpoints relative to LINE and SINE transposable elements suggests activity of these elements in the germline, which has been influenced by their orientation relative to the direction of replication and transcription. MIR and L2 repeats have lost the ability to retrotranspose (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), whereas a small subset of L1 and Alu repeats remain active today (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). The observed strand asymmetries at L1 and Alu repeats are consistent with this notion and with previous work, finding a preference of L1 repeat integration towards the leading orientation (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). The absence of structural variant strand asymmetries at LTRs is also consistent with the notion that these elements are inactive. Additional work is required to understand if the observed asymmetries of structural variants at transposable elements are aggravated in cancer and other disorders and if they are associated with disease development.</p>
    <p>We have shown that the orientation preference of multiple TFBSs around promoters and at transcribed regions cannot be explained by the nucleotide composition differences in the template and non-template strands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Therefore, it could be the result of transcription factor preferential affinity for the motif at the forward or reverse-complement orientations and interaction or interference with RNA polymerase progression. A strand preference could also indicate roles of certain transcription factors at the RNA level, examples being SOX2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>) and YY1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>), which are known to bind both DNA and RNA to regulate gene expression (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Our results suggest that TFBS orientation in transcribed regions is non-random and influences gene regulatory grammar. However, it remains unknown how the orientation of transcription factors between closely spaced TFBSs influences steric hindrance and competition for binding (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Experimental designs that systematically evaluate how the orientation of TFBSs within <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory modules influence regulatory element activity could further increase our understanding. The conglomeration of transcription factors in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory modules could be influenced by the orientation and pairwise distance of TFBSs and high-throughput reporter assay experiments (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) could provide valuable insights in this direction.</p>
    <p>Asymmetron enables the study of asymmetric biological processes. Investigation of transcriptional and replicative strand asymmetries across biological organisms reflects the number of replication forks and their orientation, the gene density and the diverse mechanisms safeguarding genome integrity (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1–4</xref>). Strand asymmetry analysis could increase our understanding of mutational processes across different disorders and evolution (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In cancer, the orientation of structural variant breakpoints could reveal unknown mutational mechanisms. In gene regulation, investigation of orientation preferences between transcription factors and their location relative to transcriptional direction could enable better modelling of gene expression. In summary, we have shown that Asymmetron can pose as a useful tool to annotate and detect DNA strand asymmetries and associate them with specific biological functions.</p>
