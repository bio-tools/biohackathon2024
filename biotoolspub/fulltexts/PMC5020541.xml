        <title>Background</title>
        <p>Single-cell RNA sequencing is fast becoming one the standard method for gene expression measurement, providing unique insights into cellular processes. A number of methods, based on general dimensionality reduction techniques, have been suggested to help infer and visualise the underlying structure of cell populations from single-cell expression levels, yet their models generally lack proper biological grounding and struggle at identifying complex differentiation paths.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Results</title>
        <p>Here we introduce cellTree: an R/Bioconductor package that uses a novel statistical approach, based on document analysis techniques, to produce tree structures outlining the hierarchical relationship between single-cell samples, while identifying latent groups of genes that can provide biological insights.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>With cellTree, we provide experimentalists with an easy-to-use tool, based on statistically and biologically-sound algorithms, to efficiently explore and visualise single-cell RNA data. The cellTree package is publicly available in the online Bionconductor repository at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/cellTree/">http://bioconductor.org/packages/cellTree/</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>Background</title>
    <p>Single-cell RNA sequencing, one of the most significant advances in recent genomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], is fast becoming the norm in whole-transcriptome expression profiling, providing unique insights into the exact state of individual cells throughout biological processes, such as cell differentiation or tumorigenesis. In opposition to traditional batch sequencing, single-cell expression measurements are not affected by cell heterogeneity within the sample and give an exact snapshot of gene activity at a specific time. The very low noise level and virtual absence of sample variance opens the door to more exact statistical modelling of gene regulatory activity and might be the key to successful regulatory network inference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
    <p>To fulfil these promises, many challenges specific to single-cell expression data analysis must first be solved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], such as the difficulty to infer the true hierarchy (or chronological order) of individual cells sampled in the same conditions (temporal or spatial). For instance, due to the destructive nature of RNA-seq measurements, time-series analysis is approximated by repeated sampling at intervals, introducing new confounding factors tied to the biological specificities of each cell sampled, as well as the risk of “pollution” by unrelated cell lines and difficulties in identifying multiple sub-differentiation branches. Analysing the similarities between cells’ expression profiles seems the key to inferring the true structure of the cell population but is made especially complex by the very high dimensionality of gene expression measurements.</p>
    <p>When cell populations can be assumed to belong to a temporal continuum, the standard approach is to assign each cell a biological “pseudotime” along which they can be ordered. In the absence of known subsets of marker genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], the vast majority of existing methods for pseudotime estimation crucially rely on classical dimension-reduction techniques to produce an embedding where pairwise cell distances can be more easily computed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] or Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
    <p>Such dimension-reduction methods can be applied with no knowledge of the underlying structure of the data. But this versatility comes at the cost of clarity in the embedding: it is difficult, often impossible, to find a plausible biological representation of the lower-dimensional components obtained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, the aggressive pre-treatment thresholding commonly required (reducing the initial input to a few hundred high-variance genes) runs the risk of over-simplifying the model by discarding low-variance genes that may play a role in some aspects of the process studied. In the case of methods like ICA (used by Monocle), the assumption of statistical independence between components is highly questionable: due to the heavy overlap between regulatory pathways, gene expression levels would presumably show correlation between different stages of a cell process. While these approaches can typically give good results on straightforward cell differentiation along a single path (where a main component representing time is sufficient to separate and order the cells), they show their limits when multiple lineages are mixed together. Not only can they fail to recognise the heterogeneity of differentiating subtypes, but they also cannot easily assign any biological interpretation to the model used.</p>
    <p>By contrast, our proposed method uses a Bayesian model better adapted to known models of gene regulation, and can produce an embedding that uses a larger number of input features without such stringent thresholding step:</p>
    <p>When considering a number of single-cell expression measurements taken over time (e.g during cell differentiation) or space (e.g. across tissues), we expect specific metabolic pathways, and the genes that compose them, to be activated according to the current biological state of the cell sampled. We can therefore hypothesise the existence of groups of genes, and their respective regulatory subnetworks, that broadly characterise each of the steps in the cellular process studied. Because of the nature of regulatory networks, such groups could potentially involve hundreds or even thousands of genes (albeit at differing levels of importance), with a lot of potential overlap between groups.</p>
    <p>To identify and utilise this group structure, our suggested method adapts a new statistical approach, borrowed from natural language processing, known as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]). LDA assumes the existence of a number of underlying “topics” that contribute, as a mixture, to explain each cell’s transcriptional activity. By comparing the different per-cell topic histograms, we can evaluate their similarity and infer complex hierarchical structures. By looking at the topics themselves, we can obtain useful biological insights on the gene sets characterising the different stages of that hierarchy (see <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Implementation</xref>).</p>
    <p>Much like other methods, an important step in our approach is the construction of a visual representation of the cell population based on this lower-dimensional model. To better help this visualisation, we introduced “backbone trees”: a new type of tree structure specifically designed to easily visualise cells along complex differentiation paths (see <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Implementation</xref>). In contrast with existing methods, however, we are able to analyse the latent groups of genes, called “topics” in the LDA model, that are used to model the cell population. An overview of these topics can directly be obtained as a list of genes ranked by their probability in each per-topic distribution, making it easy to verify if certain genes are particularly attached to a stage. For a more in-depth analysis, we use gene ontology (GO) terms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]: statistical testing allows us to select gene ontology terms that are enriched for a topic. Looking at these terms, as a list or as a subgraph of the overall GO graph, gives a quick overview of the cellular components, biological processes and molecular functions associated with each topic and provide a helpful narrative for the results obtained.</p>

      <title>Using latent Dirichlet allocation</title>
      <p>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a Bayesian mixture model, initially developed for the analysis of text documents, that allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups. In text analysis, the model assumes that each document is a mixture of topics (represented as a probability distribution with a Dirichlet prior) and each word is the result of one of the document’s topic.</p>
      <p>In the context of single-cell data analysis, documents become cells and discretised gene expression levels replace word frequencies. The fitted LDA model for our data is therefore composed of a set of topic distributions for each cell, and per-topic gene distributions. Per-cell topic histograms can then be used as a low-dimensional embedding to evaluate cell similarity and infer hierarchical relationship, while analysis of the topics themselves can provide useful biological insights on the sets of genes driving the different stages of the process studied.</p>
      <p>Given <italic>M</italic> cells, <italic>V</italic> expressed genes and a choice of <italic>K</italic> topics, the model is therefore made up of two sets of Dirichlet distributions: <disp-formula id="Equa"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <p>where <bold><italic>α</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>β</italic></bold> are vectors of length <italic>K</italic> and <italic>V</italic> representing the prior weights of per-cell topics and per-topic genes, respectively. The use of smaller values of <bold><italic>α</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>β</italic></bold> makes it possible to control the sparsity of the model (i.e. the number of topics per cell and number of genes per topic).</p>
      <p>The parameters to the posterior distributions that make the LDA model are learnt from the data (a matrix of gene expression levels for each cell) using approximate inference techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Initially solved with variational inference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], this problem is now more efficiently tackled using Gibbs Sampling (including the LDA implementation used by cellTree): a type of Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm that converges iteratively toward a stationary distribution that satisfyingly approximates the target joint distribution. In the particular case of LDA, the implementation of Gibbs Sampling makes use of some of the features of the model to greatly reduce the size of the joint distribution that must be evaluated, in a method called <italic>Collapsed</italic> Gibbs Sampling.</p>
      <p>For an in-depth explanation of the mathematics behind the general LDA model, we recommend consulting David Blei’s original paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] along with more recent work on LDA inference methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
      <p>Among the many advantages of LDA as a dimension reduction method, its ability to handle very large-dimensional data and control model sparsity (through the priors of the Dirichlet distributions) make it easy to handle unknown data with relatively little pre-treatment. Generally, it is sufficient to log-transform expression values and removes genes with low standard-deviation, without more advanced method of gene set selection (these pre-treatments are done automatically by the default cellTree pipeline).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec4">
      <title>Choosing number of topics</title>
      <p>The main parameter to the LDA fitting procedure is the desired number of topics: <italic>K</italic> (best values for other hyper-parameters, such as <bold><italic>α</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>β</italic></bold> are automatically picked by the different fitting methods). As often with such statistical methods, a large number of topics (and therefore a more complex statistical model) can lead to overfitting, and it is therefore preferable to use the smallest possible number that provides a good explanation of the data. It must be noted, however, that while very large number of topics (leading to a very dense statistical model) would likely adversely affect performances, the population structure inferred by cellTree is relatively resistant to small variations in the number of topics used.</p>
      <p>Because of the loose significance of the concept of ‘topics’ in the context of gene expression in a cell, it is difficult to reliably pick an exact number, based on biological knowledge alone. The standard method is to use cross-validation and likelihood maximisation, however the computation time for such an approach can be prohibitive on large data sets. A more time-efficient approach was suggested by Matthew Taddy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], that uses model selection through joint Maximum-a-Posteriori (MAP) estimation and iteratively fits models of increasing complexity (using the previous fit’s residuals as a basis for the next one) to exhaustively look at a large range of topic numbers in a relatively small amount of time.</p>
      <p>It is nonetheless possible to evaluate the sparsity of a fitted model associated to a chosen number of topics, by examining the gene ontology terms enriched for each topic (see <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Implementation</xref>): a lot of redundancy between enriched sets is a good indicator that the model could be made sparser.</p>

      <title>Extracting hierarchical structures</title>
      <p>Extracting a hierarchical structure of the cell population from the lower-dimensional model follows the same general idea as other methods that rely on PCA or ICA for dimensionality reduction: by first computing a matrix of pairwise distance.

      <p>This distance matrix obtained can be used with methods such as hierarchical clustering, or with various tree-building algorithms, to identify the underlying tree structure of the cells.</p>
      <p>In the general case, the cell population is measured in batches of samples obtained in similar conditions (e.g. at specific time-points) that spread along a continuum between the different stages. One natural way to visualise such a structure is using a minimum spanning tree (MST).</p>
      <p>Although many efficient algorithms exist to produce a minimum spanning tree from a distance metric, rooting such a tree is non-trivial and different choices for the root node can lead to very different structures. In some cases, sample labels can be used to identify the group of cells where the root should logically be (e.g. time 0 in a timeseries experiment). In that case, cellTree can use this information to pick the most central cell in the initial group using one of two main approaches: <list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>By first identifying the longest shortest path in the MST (a path whose length is the diameter of the tree) and picking the correct end, based on knowledge of the starting group. This approach would be particularly indicated if the dataset is known to represent a linear continuum of cells (with no branching).</p></list-item><list-item><p>In cases where branching in the cell population is expected, it may be preferable to pick one of the starting group cells, based on the structure of the group, i.e. pick the cell that is most central (in terms of average squared chi-square distances) to the rest of the group.</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>If no ordering of the groups can be inferred from experimental labelling of the samples, cellTree first attempts to identify the starting group with the lowest average intra-group distance, based on the biological assumption that intra-group variance would increase as the experiment progresses. Not only is this variance hypothesis confirmed in labelled datasets such as Trapnell et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], but also in studies of embryonic cells presented here, where cellTree correctly identified initial stages of development with no further biological input past gene expression and cell grouping (see <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">Results</xref>).</p>
      <p>However, the MST approach relies to some extent on the assumption that cell distances are uniformly distributed, whereas in fact, we can expect cells inside a batch to have much lower variance than across batches.</p>
      <p>The “ideal” structure of a series of cell observations in a differentiation experiment would look like a single path connecting all cells or, in the case of subtype differentiation, a tree with a very small number of branches (one terminal for each differentiated sub-type). Because the samples are in fact physically different, rather than the evolution of a single cell, we must expect small variations around such a theorised continuum. Our suggested approach is to identify cells that are most representative (at the gene expression level) of the biological continuum: a “backbone”, such that all remaining cells in the experiments are similar enough to a representative in that backbone.

      <p>Such an optimal backbone tree aims to give a clear hierarchical representation of the cells relationship: the objective function puts pressure on finding a (small) group of prominent cells (the backbone) that are good representatives of the major stages in the cell’s biological process (over time or space), while redundant cells that closely resemble a chosen representative are ignored.</p>
      <p>Finding an optimal solution to this problem is unfortunately NP-Complete (shown, for example, by reduction to the Vertex Cover problem or rectilinear Steiner tree problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]), but we propose a fast heuristic relying on the MST that produces a close approximation (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for algorithm in pseudocode).</p>

      <title>Analysing topics with gene ontology terms enrichment</title>
      <p>Because of their Bayesian mixture nature, ‘topics’ obtained through LDA fitting do not always match clear and coherent groupings (biological or otherwise), subject to the sparsity of the model and complexity of the input data. In particular, less sparse models (with higher number of topics) may lead to better cell distance computation, but be harder to interpret.</p>
      <p>In most cases, however, enrichment analysis of per-topic gene distribution can help characterise a given topic and its role in the cell’s process, and even provide potential biological insight, by outlining the general processes most active in specific sections of the cell tree.</p>
      <p>Topic analysis is conducted using Gene Ontologies: testing for terms that are significantly enriched within a topic. First, cellTree orders genes for each topic by their per-topic probability, then applies a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compute a p-value for each of the GO terms associated with the ordering, using the <italic>weight</italic> algorithm presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] to account for graph relationship between terms. Bonferonni-corrected significant p-values can then be used a tool for identifying the biological meaning of each topic.</p>
      <p>Because of the statistical nature of LDA models, a fair amount of overlap exists between the genes assigned to each topic (in particular for genes at the lower end of the probability distribution). In order to identify the biological specificity of each topic, it is therefore helpful to study GO terms that are either unique to a given topic or appear in a minority of topics (cellTree presents both exhaustive and topic-specific lists of GO term for each topic).</p>

    <title>Results</title>
    <p>A major obstacle in obtaining quantitative comparison metrics for single-cell ordering methods, is the difficult to establish a gold standard for cell ordering annotation: the large number of misattributed cells in standard time-series experiments is one of the driving factor behind the need for such tools in the first place. To address this issue, we used a set of single-cell measurement taken during the embryonic development of <italic>Mus musculus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]: the ability to assess development stages visually in such instance provides some level of guarantee on chronological labelling.</p>
    <p>In order to further evaluate the performance of cellTree and demonstrate its ability to infer biologically-motivated dynamic models of cell populations out of gene expression data, we applied it to a wide range of publicly available single-cell RNA-seq datasets, showing our results alongside existing tools when possible.</p>
    <p>Although all results are presented here using visual backbone tree plots, a more detailed tabular format, with full lists of ordered cells for each branch, is available as Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>.</p>
    <sec id="Sec8">
      <title>Comparison to other methods</title>
      <p>For comparison, we selected two of the most prominent tools currently publicly available to treat high-dimensional single-cell data, each representative of a different dimension-reduction approach: Monocle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], which uses ICA, and TSCAN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], which relies on PCA.</p>
      <p>Other single-cell data analysis tools which focus exclusively on low-dimensional mass cytometry data (such as Wanderlust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]) fell outside the scope of our method and were not considered. The Sincell package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], which presents a general framework to treat single-cell data, but mainly relies on ICA or PCA for dimension reduction, was also excluded from this comparison.</p>
      <p>To provide a baseline comparison, we ran a naive approach using a Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) algorithm to compute a cell ordering that approximatively minimises the total euclidean distances between each vector of gene expressions. Once a tour has been found, the starting group, provided as a parameter, is used to shift the tour as needed, and the ordering is reversed if necessary, much in the same way that Monocle and TSCAN function (cellTree does not require such manual input and tries to infer them from the data itself).</p>
      <p>Results were measured in terms of accuracy over all pairwise combination of cells between the candidate ordering and perfect ordering and are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. From a data set of 90 cells with 20,214 gene levels each, all methods start with a coarse thresholding (removing genes with low levels of expression), resulting in a smaller effective number of genes for use by the statistical model (“Input size after thresholding”). For the TSP-based approach, results were averaged over 100 iterations.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of single-cell gene expression ordering tools, using mouse embryo data</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Tool</th><th align="left">Naive</th><th align="left">Monocle</th><th align="left">TSCAN</th><th align="left">cellTree</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Method</td><td align="left">TSP</td><td align="left">ICA</td><td align="left">PCA</td><td align="left">LDA</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Input size after thresholding</td><td align="left">20,214</td><td align="left">10,452</td><td align="left">225</td><td align="left">12,903</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Accuracy in %</td><td align="left">90.6</td><td align="left">94.8</td><td align="left">95.3</td><td align="left">96.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">CPU time in seconds</td><td align="left">0.015</td><td align="left">5308.6</td><td align="left">0.08</td><td align="left">18.5</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
      <p>As can be seen, not only does cellTree outperform all other methods on this task, but it is many orders of magnitude faster than Monocle, which requires upward of an hour to proceed with its dimension-reduction step: this step could be greatly sped-up by providing a set of known marker genes, but it is assumed here that an experimentalist might not have such knowledge about the data. It is also worth noticing that, while TSCAN performs data-reduction much faster, it starts with a much-reduced input of 225 genes (obtained by thresholding the initial set), before proceeding with PCA. This drastic thresholding may result in a loss of information, especially in genes that are only active in a small subset of the cells.</p>
      <p>Although matters of visualisation techniques are essentially subjective and difficult to evaluate quantatively, we surmise that our suggested visualisation as a backbone tree provides the clearest overview of the cell hierarchy.</p>
      <p>Importantly, as illustrated in the next sections, cellTree’s superior accuracy is not obtained at the expense of model legibility: unlike other methods, cellTree’s models can be readily analysed to produce useful biological insights about the process studied.</p>

      <p>The results obtained are qualitatively similar to that of Monocle (see comparison in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), although it could be argued that the visualisation as backbone tree used by cellTree is easier to interpret than the type of MST used by Monocle. In stark contrast to other methods, however, not only does cellTree not require any pre-existing knowledge about the cell population (such as the number of expected branches or the position of the tree root), it can in fact attach biological information to the different parts of the cell tree through analysis of the gene expression data.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Myoblast MST.

      <p>As can be observed on the version of the tree annotated with topic distributions, undifferentiated cells are dominated by topic 1. A look at GO terms uniquely enriched for that topic (see Tables <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), reveals a large number of terms indicative of highly mitotic conditions, such as cell division (BP:GO:0051301), mitotic nuclear division (BP:GO:0007067), transcription-coupled excision repair (BP:GO:0006283) and GTPase mediated signal transduction (BP:GO:0007264). Within the first 24 h (topic 2), there is a shift of the myocyte differentiation to more transcriptional processes (CC:GO:005665). At 48 h (topic 4), the myocytes undergo intracellular protein transport (BP:GO:006886). At the 72 h time-point (topic 3) the myocytes undergo protein translational processes, while developing structural component of Z-disks (CC:GO:0030018) and stress fibers (CC:GO:001725) allowing filament sliding (BP:GO:0030049) and MAPKK activity (BP:GO:0000186) for cellular fusion in high-mitogenic conditions. Furthermore, although not unique to one topic (see extended table of significantly enriched GO terms in Additional files <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>), Wnt signalling pathway (BP:GO:0090263), which regulates crucial aspects of cell fate determination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], appears significantly enriched for topic 3 (<italic>p</italic> = 5.8e-10) and 5 (<italic>p</italic> = 2.5e-11).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>List of biological process go terms significantly

      <p>The branch of non-differentiating cells is dominated by topic 5, which shows strong enrichment for cellular protein metabolic process (BP:GO:0044267) and 7-me mRNA capping (BP:GO:0006370), but also viral transcriptional regulation (BP:GO:0050434), which may suggest a virus coevolution in the myocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This non-differentiated set shows expression of the actin-related Arp2/3 protein complex (CC:GO:0005885), suggesting the potential to further mature to either skeletal or cardiac myocyte. It also regulates the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane junction with proteins such as STIM [EMBL:ENSMUSG00000027498], to control signalling and metabolic processes for the proper regulation of calcium within the striated muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
      <p>Significantly enriched GO terms for all topics can be conveniently visualised as a subgraph of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) for Cellular Component GO terms (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Cellular Component GO Terms for Myoblasts.

      <p>Without the need for further manual analysis or expert input, cellTree was able to infer and label major stages of the myoblast differentiation process, along with the biological specificities of the set of undifferentiated cells, in line with existing biological knowledge on myoblast differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec10">
      <title>Study of embryonic development</title>
      <p>In order to highlight the robustness of our approach on highly heterogeneous cell population, we analysed two data sets following embryonic cells at different stages of differentiation: a study profiling lncRNAs of human-induced embryonic stem cells (hESC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and a study of autosomal monoallelic genes from oocyte to blastocytes in <italic>Mus musculus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We show that cellTree facilitates the identification of physiologically meaningful subpopulations that clearly define the continuum along the process of differentiation.</p>
      <p>Both datasets were analysed with four topics, privileging a sparse model with clearly delineated topics, over a more complex model with more topics, which may better explain the cells relationship but present more functional overlap between topics (note that because the two models were fitted and analysed independently, there is no correspondence between topic numbers in either model).</p>
      <p>In both cases, we observe that the differentiation continuum was overall consistent with general biological knowledge and published analysis of the data: the trees (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) show a sequential ordering of cellular stages by their progress through embryonic cell development in a linear fashion (a full tabular list of the cells ordered by cellTree can be found in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Embryonic cell differentiation. Backbone trees obtained by cellTree for hESC (<bold>a</bold> and <bold>b</bold>) and mouse embryo cell differentiation (<bold>c</bold> and <bold>d</bold>). Both trees are shown annotated with cell type (<bold>a</bold> and <bold>c</bold>) and topic distributions (<bold>b</bold> and <bold>d</bold>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12859_2016_1175_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p>
      <p>For the hESC data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], the authors noted that stage-specific lncRNA expression patterns emphasise the critical role it plays in development. In other words, maternal-inherited lncRNA dominates early stages, before decreasing as the embryo develops, which suggests the critical role hESC-specific lncRNAs play in pluripotency maintenance till the morulae stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In agreement with this analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], our model shows oocytes and zygotes clustered together in the same development stage (dominated by topic 3), while X2, X4, and X8 cells are clustered under topic 4.</p>
      <p>By looking at the GO analysis for the different topics using terms for Biological Processes (BP, see Tables <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> and <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref> for extended table), Cellular Components (CC, see Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> and

      <p>Oocytes progress into stages of differentiated cell types in a process that requires cellular components to regulate gene expression patterns appropriately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. GO terms for topic 3, indeed show mitosis (BP:GO:0000281) as its dominating biological process.</p>
      <p>Looking directly at the top genes in the distribution for topic 3 (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>) also highlights oocytes’ unique ability to remodel the chromatin to closely coordinate the cellular and chromosomal events of oogenesis: ACTB [EMBL:ENSG00000075624], PTMA [EMBL:ENSG00000187514], RPS8 [EMBL:ENSG00000142937], RPL19 [EMBL:ENSG00000108298], RPS7 [EMBL:ENSG00000171863], SPL41 [EMBL:ENST00000552314] and RPL23 [EMBL:ENSG00000125691] are all involved in several transcription regulatory factors that are regulators of ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis.</p>
      <p>As development progresses to the morulae stage (topic 4), we see a strong enrichment for nuclear ribonucleoproteins (CC:GO:0005732) such as the MLL1 complex (CC:GO:0071339) which activate spliceosomes (CC:GO:0005689) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
      <p>In agreement with the published analysis, cellTree properly segregates the blastocyst 1 trophectoderm layer (TE, in the late blastocyst branch) from the inner cell mass (ICM, in the hESC passage branch), emphasising the critical differentiation stage of the morulae 1 embryo.</p>
      <p>Looking at the topic distributions around the point of separation between TE and ICM, we see the contribution of topic 1: initiating self-renewal and pluripotency in blastocysts 1 by developing the endogenous extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Due to the intensive restructuring, the critical demand that drives mitochondrial activity is met by ATP synthases (GO:0045263). FBXO5 [EMBL:ENSG00000112029], DIDO1 [EMBL:ENSG00000101191], PSRC1 [EMBL:ENSG00000134222], PPP2R3C [EMBL:ENSG00000092020] are responsible for the nucleosome structure of the chromosomal spindles (GO:0005819) to remodel the nucleosome. STAU1 transports and localizes mRNA to different subcellular compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], while RPL28 [EMBL:ENSMODG00000000275] is required for the regulation of transcription within the cell body (CC:GO:0044297) to regulate stem cell pluripotency and neoplastic progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p>
      <p>In agreement with the published analysis, passage 0 hESC cells are closest to the blastocysts, emphasising the gene expression landscape of hESC derivation, defined by the different stages of blastocyte 3 epiblasts (EPI) within the outgrowth of hESCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], highlighting the continuum of hESC development in contrast to simple hierarchical clustering. Although passage 0 and 10 of hESC outgrowth are in the same branch of the tree, as could be expected since only 4.6 % (861/18383) of the genes show differential expression between the two outgrowth passages, cellTree correctly identifies the two groups where the initial publication was unable to obtain that level of clustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>
      <p>The initial publication’s authors report the possibility of misclassification within the inner mass portion (ICM) of the blastocysts, which can result in some late blastocyte stage cells labeled as TE cells, which accounts for the lack of uniformity within these groups in the structure inferred by cellTree. The similarity between the ICM lineages of PE and EPI, as indicated by blastocytes 2 and 3 respectively, can be observed within the tree structure. Throughout the development process, MTRNR2L2, GAPDH, MTRNR2L9, and PTMA are all neuroprotective proteins that stabilise the cell during its reconstructive development.</p>
      <p>The trees obtained for mouse embryonic cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] present very similar topic enrichment:</p>
      <p>The maternal-zygotic transition dominates at the 2-cell stage (topic 3), indicated by the initiation of the mitotic processes (BP:GO:0006355) that leads to the gradual of maternal DNA. Cell cycle processes (BP:GO:0007049) include ubiquitinone-specific proteases (MF:GO:0004843) and the mediator complex (CC:GO:0016592) and inhibit apoptotic processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] for the maternal-zygotic transition.</p>
      <p>In the mid and late 2-cell stage (topic 2), the decline of high-mitogen conditions is coupled with an increase in ribosome biogenesis (BP:GO:0042254) which mitigates snoRNA assembly (MF:GO:0030515), and transcriptional regulation of spliceosomes (CC:GO:0005689) and proteosomes (CC:GO:0005838).</p>
      <p>Finally, topic 1 is mainly associated with the translation processes (BP:GO:0006412) and transport processes (BP:GO:0015986) of the blastocytes, while the maturity of fibroblast and liver cell controls (BXC) is clearly visible in topic 4’s association to metabolic and catabolic processes, such as xenobiotic metabolic process (BP:GO:0006805) and glutathione metabolic process (BP:GO:0006749), DNA methylation patterns (MF:GO:000839) and receptor ligand binding (MF:GO:0020037).</p>
      <p>As we can see from this GO analysis of the gene models used, the sequential developmental process of the cells is perfectly aligned with the topics found by cellTree, and regions that are susceptible to perturbation during embryo differentiation are highlighted by the topic distributions.</p>
      <p>Although focussing on terms uniquely enriched for each topic is generally sufficient to link each of the model’s topic to a clearly delineated type of cellular or molecular activity, especially when the general subtype of cell is already known, it is also possible to look at a more comprehensive list of enriched terms that allow overlap between topics to gain new biological insights (see table of rare, but non-unique, significantly enriched GO terms for hESC in Additional files <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). There too, a good overview of each topic’s role in the differentiation can be obtained by looking at GO subgraphs (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Enriched GO terms subgraph for hESC.

      <p>Although cellTree is typically best suited to handle cell differentiation data over time, we also show that it can reveal interesting insights about latent subtypes in heterogeneous cell populations.</p>
      <p>Deciphering the cellular taxonomy of brain cells is still a work in progress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Neuronal diversity is supported by functional complexity, as overlapping characteristics of interneuron subtypes would otherwise be difficult to explain, such as is the case with interneuron diversity within the rostrocaudal axis in <italic>Mus musculus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>
      <p>We applied cellTree to single-cell RNA-seq measurements of mouse cortical cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] to see if it could help deciphering cells subtypes based on genomic profiles alone.</p>
      <p>The resulting backbone tree (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and Additional files <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref> for full ranking of cells) overall shows a structure in line with known subtype labels in the dataset and enriched GO terms (see Tables <xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="table">9</xref>, <xref rid="Tab10" ref-type="table">10</xref> and <xref rid="Tab11" ref-type="table">11</xref>) deliver biologically-coherent explanations for each topic.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Mouse cortical cell subtypes.

      <p>The combined effect of topic 2’s decrease and topic 3’s increase matches the biological activity expected in a progression from interneurons to pyramidal cells: as interneurons differentiate into pyramidal neurons, they move away from synaptic vesicle exocytosis (BP:GO:0016079) to a more calcium-based and electrical signalling through ATP hydrolysis (BP:GO:0015991) and calmodulin regulation of neurites’ tips by syntaxin-1 (MF:GO:0017075), which binds to the plasma membranes. This is aligned with studies showing that interneurons and pyramidal cells are both derived from progenitor neocortical cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p>
      <p>The increasing importance of topic 1 in the left branch corresponds to the appearance of more prominent structural features in myelinated neuronal cell types, turning protuberances from the triangular shaped soma of the pyramidal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] into the branching protrusions of the oligodendrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]: the excessive myelin glycoprotein present in oligodendrocytes membranes is reflected by the significant protein folding (BP:GO:0006457) activity.</p>
      <p>The other branch comprised mostly of non-myelinated glial cells, such as microglia and astrocytes, is dominated by topic 4. Defining functional features of topic 4, such as oxidation reduction processes (BP:GO:0055114) and transport (BP:GO:0006810) in the blood vasculature appropriately outline the structural closeness of epidermal mural cells and microglia [29,30], along with more specific roles such as the participation in metal ion homeostasis (BP:GO:0046916) of endothelial mural cells and negative regulation of angiogenesis (BP:GO:0016525) usually observed in epithelial mural cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p>
      <p>Astrocytes are clustered by cellTree at the end of the differentiation spectrum in the non-myelinated branch, in line with the similarities in vasculature linkage functionality between these neuronal subtypes. Topic 6 accurately marks the stimulated proliferation at the astrocyte stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] with the poly(A) RNA binding process (BP:GO:0044822).</p>
      <p>Through gene expression values alone, cellTree not only automatically identified myelination as one of the major differentiating characteristic within glial cells: splitting oligodendrocytes and non-myelinated glial cells into two separate branches, it also identified many of the major structural and functional features linking different cortical cell subtypes.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>With cellTree, we introduced an entirely novel approach to single-cell gene expression analysis that not only can infer complex underlying hierarchical structures in cell populations from expression data alone, but also provide biological backing for the model it creates. The representation of cells as statistical mixture of topics allows for the capture of subtle evolving characteristics between cells along a continuum, and deals well with heterogeneous populations.</p>
    <p>Although rooted in a strong Bayesian statistical framework, the package is designed to be useable by experimentalists with only minimal bioinformatics skills and absolutely no knowledge in machine learning. Using data meta-analysis, the package can provide reasonable default values for most of the parameters used by the model inference, visualisation and analysis algorithms, making it possible for an unfamiliar user of the software to quickly evaluate a new dataset in a few simple lines of R code. Finally, in addition to letting users manipulate the results as standard R objects, all graph visualisation, ranking tables and result summaries can be rendered to file in PDF or LATE Xformat, for easy reuse in scientific communication.</p>
    <p>As with most machine learning models, model complexity is a crucial aspect of the LDA techniques used by cellTree: while denser models (using more topics and a “flater” per-topic distribution over the genes) may yield a better distance matrix between cells (and lead to a more accurate hierarchical structure inference), they are also harder to interpret and subject to the risk of overfitting. A balance must therefore be found with models that produce biologically-useful results, yet remain sparse enough to avoid overfitting and maximise clarity.</p>
    <p>In addition to the likelihood-based model selection method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] currently used by cellTree, we are hoping to offer improved approches for automatic model selection, based on recent advances in topic modelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] in our next release. Similarly, we are planning to take advantage of recent improvements to the field, to offer a more comprehensive semantic analysis of topics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p>
    <p>We also plan to refine the GO enrichment method used by cellTree by taking advantage of techniques for better multiple-hypotheses testing correction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and replacing the current rank-based test on the per-topic gene list by statistical testing of the probability distribution itself.</p>
    <p>The next step in our development roadmap is the addition of a number of standard methods for both dimensionality-reduction (such as PCA and ICA) and population structure inference, in addition to the topic-based methods already implemented, in order to offer experimentalists an integrated interface to quickly run and compare different analysis pipelines on their single-cell gene expression dataset.</p>
