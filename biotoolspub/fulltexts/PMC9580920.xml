    <abstract>
      <p>The 3D architectures of RNAs are essential for understanding their cellular functions. While an accurate scoring function based on the statistics of known RNA structures is a key component for successful RNA structure prediction or evaluation, there are few tools or web servers that can be directly used to make comprehensive statistical analysis for RNA 3D structures. In this work, we developed RNAStat, an integrated tool for making statistics on RNA 3D structures. For given RNA structures, RNAStat automatically calculates RNA structural properties such as size and shape, and shows their distributions. Based on the RNA structure annotation from DSSR, RNAStat provides statistical information of RNA secondary structure motifs including canonical/non-canonical base pairs, stems, and various loops. In particular, the geometry of base-pairing/stacking can be calculated in RNAStat by constructing a local coordinate system for each base. In addition, RNAStat also supplies the distribution of distance between any atoms to the users to help build distance-based RNA statistical potentials. To test the usability of the tool, we established a non-redundant RNA 3D structure dataset, and based on the dataset, we made a comprehensive statistical analysis on RNA structures, which could have the guiding significance for RNA structure modeling. The python code of RNAStat, the dataset used in this work, and corresponding statistical data files are freely available at GitHub (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/RNA-folding-lab/RNAStat" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/RNA-folding-lab/RNAStat</ext-link>).</p>

    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>RNA molecules play important roles in various biological processes, ranging from carrying genetic information, participating in protein synthesis, catalyzing biochemical reactions, and regulating gene expressions, to acting as a structural molecule in cellular organelles (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Doherty and Doudna, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Dethoff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Cech and Steitz, 2014</xref>). Generally, to perform functions, RNAs need to form special tertiary structures, which typically can be determined by experimental methods such as cryo-electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Fernandez-Leiro and Scheres, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Rose et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Westhof and Leontis, 2021</xref>). However, the structures deposited in Protein Data Bank (PDB) are still limited, since it is expensive and time-consuming to experimentally derive high-resolution RNA 3D structures (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Rose et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Westhof and Leontis, 2021</xref>). This situation has led to a great demand in structural biology to envisage the RNA structures using prediction methods (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Hajdin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Shi Y.-Z. et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Miao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Schlick and Pyle, 2017</xref>).</p>
    <p>In the last decade, there are some computational models have been developed for predicting RNA 3D structures, among which the knowledge-based fragment assembly methods (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Gan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Das and Baker, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Parisien and Major, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Das et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Flores et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cao and Chen, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Rother et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Popenda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Jian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>) and the physics-based coarse-grained (CG) models have gained more attention (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Jonikas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Flores and Altman, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Pasquali and Derreumaux, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Flores et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Denesyuk and Thirumalai, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Xia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Shi YZ. et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Šulc et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Krokhotin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Boniecki et al., 2016</xref>). For example, the FARNA/FARFAR can assemble trinucleotide fragments into 3D structures corresponding to an RNA sequence with the use of the Monte Carlo algorithm and a knowledge-based energy function, and the parameters of energy function were determined from the statistical analysis of known RNA 3D structures (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Das and Baker, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Das et al., 2010</xref>). The SimRNA with a CG representation, which employs a statistical potential derived from PDB structures, and can fold RNAs using only sequence information (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Boniecki et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, we have also provided a new CG model to predict 3D structures and stability of an RNA in ion solutions from sequence alone (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Shi Y.-Z. et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2019</xref>). Although the potential energy of our model is mainly physics-based, the potentials, especially bonded potentials, were also parameterized by the statistical analysis on the available 3D structures of RNAs in PDB (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Shi YZ. et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the existing knowledge-based methods usually produce an ensemble of candidate structures, which should be further evaluated to recognize the best candidates as close to native structures as possible (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Huang and Zou, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Miao and Westhof, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Magnus et al., 2020</xref>). To address this issue, several statistical potentials have been developed to evaluate RNA 3D structures (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bernauer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Capriotti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Masso, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), such as RASP (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Capriotti et al., 2011</xref>), RNA KB potentials (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bernauer et al., 2011</xref>), 3dRNAscore (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), and DFIRE (<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Generally, these potentials are proportional to the frequencies of occurrence of atom pairs, angles, or dihedral angles in PDB structures based on Boltzmann or Bayesian formulations (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Huang and Zou, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2019</xref>). For example, Capriotti et al. have built the RASP by calculating the density distribution of distance between any two atoms in all the known RNA structures (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Capriotti et al., 2011</xref>). The 3dRNAscore introduced by Wang et al. uses seven typical RNA dihedral angles as well as distance-dependent geometrical descriptions for atom pairs to construct the statistical potentials (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to structure evaluation, very recently, Xiong et al. have proposed a fully knowledge-based function (BRiQ) based on statistics of orientation distribution of one base around another base from the PDB structures for improving RNA model refinement (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Xiong et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
    <p>Obviously, all these advances on RNA structure modeling indicate that to gather various statistics of RNA 3D structures is generally essential to predict RNA tertiary structures. However, there are few tools or web servers that can be used to make comprehensive statistical analysis for RNA 3D structures (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Andronescu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cock et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Baulin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Danaee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Magnus et al., 2020</xref>). Recently, Baulin et al. have proposed a database URSDB (the Universe of RNA structures database) to store information (e.g., annotations of main structural elements) obtained all RNA-containing PDBs (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Baulin et al., 2016</xref>). Although the URSDB can allow the user to get statistics on structural motifs (base pairs, stems, and loops) based on the information provided by the software of DSSR (dissecting the spatial structure of RNA) (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Lu, 2020</xref>), these statistics on RNA secondary structure motifs could be far from enough to help RNA 3D structure modeling (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Miao and Westhof, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2019</xref>). Fortunately, several works have provided statistics of RNA structures from different aspects. For example, both the RNA 3D Motif Atlas and bpRNA can provide a statistical summary of the hairpin and internal loop motifs (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Parlea et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Danaee et al., 2018</xref>). The RNA STRAND can also provide information on structural features such as types and sizes for stems and loops (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Andronescu et al., 2008</xref>). To build scoring function for RNA structure prediction, Bottaro et al. as well as Das and Baker have developed methods to calculate the geometrical properties of RNA base-pairing and base-stacking (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bottaro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Das and Baker, 2007</xref>). Despite all this progress, with the rapidly increasing number of RNA structures deposited in PDB (<xref rid="s10" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure S1</xref> in the Supplementary Material) (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Rose et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Westhof and Leontis, 2021</xref>), an available tool to convenient access comprehensive statistical information of RNA 3D structures is still necessary.</p>
    <p>Here, we present a novel tool, named as RNAStat, special for the statistical analysis of RNA 3D structures. It can be used to calculate structural information of RNA 3D structure(s) at different levels: global 3D structural level, secondary structure level, and atomic level. We first introduced the function and principle of the RNAStat. Afterward, based on a non-redundant RNA structure dataset established by us, we utilized the RNAStat to perform statistical analysis for RNA 3D structures, and provided various statistical data of RNA structural properties (e.g., size/shape, geometry of base-pairing/stacking, secondary structure motifs, and atom-atom distance). Throughout the article, we also discussed the potential value of these statistics on RNA 3D structure prediction and evaluation.</p>

      <title>2.3 Secondary Structure Motifs</title>
      <p>To obtain the secondary structure motifs for an RNA PDB structure, the RNAStat can directly call the DSSR through the corresponding python command (e.g., x3dna-dssr.exe--json “+ ”-o = file); The DSSR is an integrated and automated command-line tool for analysis and annotation of RNA tertiary structures, and it can characterize nucleotides, base pairs, pseudoknots, loops, stems, and coaxially stacked helices (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Lu, 2020</xref>); see an example in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. Based on the information extracted from DSSR, for an RNA structure set, the RNAStat can further provide the statistics of secondary structural elements, including base-pairs, stems, and various loops. In this work, we considered all C-G, A-U and G-U pairs to be canonical base pairs, and all other base pairs to be non-canonical ones, and the definitions of the secondary structural motifs can be found everywhere (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Leontis and Westhof, 2001</xref>) and the simple illustration of them are also shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>.</p>

      <title>2.4 Geometry of Base-Pairing and Base-Stacking</title>
      <p>Since base-pairing and base-stacking are critical interactions that stabilize RNA 3D structures (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Butcher and Pyle, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bottaro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), the RNAStat can calculate the geometry between two bases in base-pairing/stacking. First, the whole nucleobase (i.e., A, U, G, and C) is treated as a single rigid group, and a coordinate system is set up on each base, with the origin (O) at the geometric center of all the heavy atoms. Similar to the local referential of a nucleotide introduced by <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Gendron et al. (2001</xref>), for pyrimidines (or purines), the two unit vectors, <inline-formula id="inf38"><mml:math id="m42" overflow="scroll"><mml:mi>u</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> between coordinates of atom N1 and C8 (C4 in purines), and <inline-formula id="inf39"><mml:math id="m43" overflow="scroll"><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> between coordinates of atom N1 and N3, can be built, and the unit vector <inline-formula id="inf40"><mml:math id="m44" overflow="scroll"><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is oriented along the cross product <inline-formula id="inf41"><mml:math id="m45" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. The unit vector <inline-formula id="inf42"><mml:math id="m46" overflow="scroll"><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is built between coordinates of the origin (O) and atom N1, and the unit vector <inline-formula id="inf43"><mml:math id="m47" overflow="scroll"><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is given by <inline-formula id="inf44"><mml:math id="m48" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>; see <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>.

      <p>To test the RNAStat, we established a non-redundant dataset based on the RNA 3D Hub set (Release nrlist_3.157_4.0 Å), in which the sequence identity between any two chains in the set is less than 95% (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Leontis and Zirbel, 2012</xref>). Firstly, we collected 1,245 representative RNAs of all the different clusters with a resolution &lt;4.0 Å from RNA 3D Hub list, which can be downloaded from <ext-link xlink:href="http://rna.bgsu.edu/rna3dhub/nrlist" ext-link-type="uri">http://rna.bgsu.edu/rna3dhub/nrlist</ext-link>. Then, we deleted the structure of non-RNA strands in the dataset. Afterwards, we removed the RNA structures with sequence identity ˃ 80% using the BLASTN program (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Camacho et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, through the prior operation steps, 748 RNA structures were retained and their 3D structure files were downloaded from the PDB. The final RNA structure dataset used in this work can be found in the Supplementary Material as well as at GitHub (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/RNA-folding-lab/RNAStat" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/RNA-folding-lab/RNAStat</ext-link>), including PDB IDs, and PDB CIF files.</p>

      <title>3.1 Overview of the RNAStat</title>
      <p>In this work, we present the RNAStat, an integrated tool for making comprehensive statistics on RNA 3D structures. As shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, the RNAStat can be used to do statistical analysis for RNA 3D structures at different levels, such as global 3D structure level, secondary structure level, and atom level. The code of the RNAStat in python can be found at GitHub through <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/RNA-folding-lab/RNAStat" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/RNA-folding-lab/RNAStat</ext-link>. In the following, we will give a brief introduction of the usage method of the tool.</p>
      <p>The input to RNAStat is the coordinate file(s) of RNA 3D structure(s) in CIF format. Based on the needs of users, the input can be a single PDB file of an RNA structure or the PDB files for a given RNA structure set. For each PDB file, the RNAStat can calculate the size and shape of the RNA through <xref rid="e1" ref-type="disp-formula">Eqs 1</xref>–<xref rid="e4" ref-type="disp-formula">4</xref> (in section of Materials and Methods), and call the DSSR to obtain its secondary structure motifs, e.g., the information of base-pairs, stems and various loops; see <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. In the RNAStat, the distance between any heavy atom pair can also be calculated by <xref rid="e5" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 5</xref>, and the atom pair types can be specified by the user or default to all kinds of atom types, where 85 heavy atom types in four nucleotides (A, U, G, and C) are considered (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2019</xref>); see <xref rid="s10" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S2</xref> in the Supplementary Material. In addition, based on the information of base-pairing and the coordinates of atoms in two paired bases, the geometrical properties of base-pairing and base-stacking can also be calculated.</p>
      <p>More importantly, for RNA structure set, the RNAstat can provide statistical information for all the above structural properties as well as the frequency distribution of various base pairs, which could be directly used to build statistical potentials for RNA structure evaluation or refinement (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Miao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Xiong et al., 2021</xref>). The details of the methods for the calculations and statistical analysis can be found in section of Materials and Methods.</p>

      <title>3.2 Test on the RNA Structure Set</title>
      <p>To show the applicability of the RNAStat tool, we established a non-redundant RNA 3D structure dataset (see Materials and Methods), and took it as an example for RNA 3D structure analysis and statistic. Simultaneously, based on the RNA structure set, we also provided various statistical results of RNA structures, and which could contribute to building RNA statistical potentials or energy function of RNA CG models.</p>

Although this is in accordance with the result from Hyeon et al. (i.e., <inline-formula id="inf55"><mml:math id="m61" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>5.5</mml:mn><mml:msup><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Hyeon et al., 2006</xref>), the parameters are slightly different. The reasons may be that the RNA structures in our non-redundant dataset are more diverse, and each <inline-formula id="inf56"><mml:math id="m62" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is calculated based on the entire RNA structure no matter how many chains in the RNA, instead of based on each RNA chain. As shown in <xref rid="s10" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure S3</xref> in the Supplementary Material, the length of most RNAs in dataset is in the range of (10, 100). The corresponding regression equation for these short RNAs is <inline-formula id="inf57"><mml:math id="m63" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>5.1</mml:mn><mml:msup><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0.37</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that the length-dependence of structure size is relatively weak for long RNAs due to the more compact conformations. In addition, since RNA is a polyelectrolyte, its size also depends on the ion concentration (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Woodson, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Tan and Chen, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2015</xref>), which is one of the reasons why the <inline-formula id="inf58"><mml:math id="m64" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mo>'</mml:mo></mml:msubsup><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> of RNAs with same length have a significant difference.</p>
        <p><xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> depicts the distribution of asphericity parameter ∆ of RNA structures in the dataset, where ∆ spans over the whole range from 0 to 0.8, and ∼60% has ∆&lt;0.2, suggesting that RNAs are mostly spherical in nature (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Hyeon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). The distribution of the shape parameter S for RNA structures is displayed in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>. The plot exhibits that almost all RNAs have S &gt; 0, and the distribution has a significant peak around S = 0, implying that RNAs do not deviate much from the spherical symmetry. Our statistics on ∆ and S are very close to the results from RNA complexes reported in Ref. (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Hyeon et al., 2006</xref>), while are with the different from those of single-chain RNAs.</p>

        <title>3.2.2 Statistics on RNA Secondary Motifs</title>
        <p>Since RNA structure formation is generally hierarchical (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Brion and Westhof, 1997</xref>), the information of RNA secondary structures could be the key to evaluate or predict RNA tertiary structures. The DSSR software can be called by the RNAStat to analyze all the RNA tertiary structures in the dataset; see <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. Based on the results from DSSR, various statistics on RNA secondary motifs can be showed.</p>
        <p>As shown in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>; <xref rid="s10" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Tables S3–S5</xref> in the Supplementary Material, the guanine nucleotide (i.e., G) and the base pairs of G-C/C-G are the most common in the RNA dataset, e.g., the probability of occurrence of G (∼34%) is apparently higher than that of the other bases. Using the dataset of RNA structures, we found that the number of base pairs <inline-formula id="inf59"><mml:math id="m65" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> grows linearly with the sequence length L with the slope as ∼0.48 (i.e., <inline-formula id="inf60"><mml:math id="m66" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.48</mml:mn><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), and the number of non-canonical base pair <inline-formula id="inf61"><mml:math id="m67" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> also increases significantly with L: <inline-formula id="inf62"><mml:math id="m68" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.21</mml:mn><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>; see <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, suggesting that interaction of non-canonical base-pairing is rather important in 3D structure modeling for RNAs, especially for large RNAs (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Das et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

        <p><xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> shows the probability of the occurrence of base pairs including canonical and non-canonical base pairs; seen also in <xref rid="s9" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S4</xref> in the Supplementary Material, and due to the proportional relation between base-pairing strength and their relative probability, this statistic of base pairs can be directly used to parameterize the base-pairing energy function for RNA models. For example, based on the relative probability between G-C/C-G (∼40%) and A-U/U-A (∼20%), we have set that the energy of G-C is twice the strength of the A-U in our CG model (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Shi Y.-Z. et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2019</xref>), and the common non-canonical base pairs (e.g., A-G, A-A, and G-G) will be further taken into account. In addition, base-pair stacking make a significant contribution to the stability of an RNA structure (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Schlick and Pyle, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Miao and Westhof, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Brion and Westhof, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Laing and Schlick, 2009</xref>), and the stacking interaction parameters can also be obtained from the statistical frequency of base-pair stack (<xref rid="s9" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S5</xref> in the Supplementary Material), which could improve the predictions of RNA secondary (or 3D) structures and their thermodynamic stability (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Dima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Gardner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Sloma and Mathews, 2017</xref>).</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the distribution of length of RNA secondary structure motifs (e.g., stem and loops) could be helpful in the evaluation of structures predicted by <italic>ab initio</italic> models (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Brion and Westhof, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Danaee et al., 2018</xref>). <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> displays the distribution of the length of stem, which is defined by the number of continuous canonical base pairs (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). Although the distribution of stem length for the RNAs in dataset is very broad, there is a prominent peak around ∼2 bp and the length of stem greater than 10 bp occur much less frequently; see <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, suggesting that stems are constantly interrupted by loops (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>) (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Danaee et al., 2018</xref>). For hairpin loops shown in <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, we found that hairpin loops are most likely to have a length of 4 nt, i.e., tetraloops, which have been proved to be extremely stable by thermodynamic experiments (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Butcher and Pyle, 2011</xref>), and the heptaloops (i.e., hairpin loops of length 7 nt) are the second most frequent, in line with the results from bpRNA, and RNA 3D Motif Atlas (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Danaee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Parlea et al., 2016</xref>). On the contrary, the distribution of the bulge loop length only has one very significant peak at 1 nt, and almost all the bulge loops are with length less than 5 nt; seen in <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>. The reasons could be that one stem interrupted by short bulge loops (e.g., 1 nt) is generally as stable as continuous helix with same sequence due to the coaxial-stacking interaction between two stems (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Butcher and Pyle, 2011</xref>), while the stability of RNAs is reduced with the increase of the length of bulge loop (<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6E,F</xref>, the distributions of internal/junction loop lengths are more complex, with more than one broad peak. For example, there are about four visible peaks observed for internal loop at 2, 4, 6, and 9 nt, respectively. Since the bases in two sides (5′ and 3′) of an internal loop often pairing together in non-canonical way, the internal loops often tend to be symmetric in order to keep a more stable structure (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Laing and Schlick, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Butcher and Pyle, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Gardner et al., 2011</xref>). However, we only calculated the length of the entire loop without distinguishing 5′ and 3’ loop sequences, for simplicity in the present version of the RNAStat. More detailed statistics of internal/multi-loops should be taken into account in the future to help improve their energy parameters calculation.</p>

        <title>3.2.4 Distributions of the Distance Between Atoms</title>
        <p>In view of the fact that most of the knowledge-based statistical potentials for RNA structure evaluation are based on the distances between atoms (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bernauer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Capriotti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Huang and Zou, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2019</xref>). The RNAStat can also be used to calculate the distance between any two non-bonded heavy atoms located at different nucleotides in RNA. For example, the distribution of distance between two atoms with type of P is shown in <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>. In addition to a very broad peak at ∼70 Å, there are three noteworthy peaks at ∼5.7 Å, ∼11.2 Å, and ∼18.4 Å, respectively. The first two peaks are corresponding to the distances of two P atoms in the nearest neighbor nucleotides and next-nearest neighbor nucleotides, respectively, and the third peak represents distance between two P atoms in paired nucleotides; see <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7B,C</xref>.

    <title>4 Conclusion</title>
    <p>In summary, RNAStat is an integrated computational tool to perform comprehensive statistical analysis for the RNA 3D structures given by the users. The tool cannot only automatically calculate RNA global structural properties such as size and shape, but also analyze atom-atom distance distributions at atomic level. Furthermore, the tool can provide statistics of RNA secondary structure elements (e.g., canonical/non-canonical base pairs, stems and various loops) and geometric properties of base-pairing and base-stacking. In this work, we have established and utilized a non-redundant RNA 3D structure dataset to test the usability of the tool, and the statistical data could be directly used to build statistical potentials or energy functions for RNA 3D structure evaluation and prediction.</p>
    <p>Still and all, further improvements need to be made on the tool to perform more detailed statistical analysis and to make it easier to use. For example, most of the available RNA statistical potentials generally adopt a distance-dependent scheme, however for proteins, the orientation-dependent statistical potentials, which consider the many-body interactions by statistically describing both distance and relative orientation between interacting atom groups, and have been proved to have better performance than the traditional distance-dependent potentials (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Masso, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, in the further development of RNAStat, the distribution of orientation (e.g., angle and torsion angle) between atoms as well as the joint probability at the given relative distance and orientation of observing two atoms should be taken into account. In addition, although the RNAStat is free-installation and convenient to use through command lines, it is still required the python installation or corresponding environment configuration. Thus, a user-friendly webserver could be further built after the deepened improvement for the tool. Very recent studies have shown that RNA scoring functions derived from deep learning of RNA 3D structures performed well in identification of accurate structural models (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Kurgan and Zhou, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Townshend et al., 2021</xref>), which suggests that more potential structural features of RNAs should be further mined with the aid of deep neural networks.</p>
