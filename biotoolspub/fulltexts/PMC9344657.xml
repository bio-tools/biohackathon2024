Thus, deriving health indicators based on microbiome diversity measures is essential. While microbiome data generated using high-throughput 16S rRNA marker gene surveys are appealing for this purpose, 16S surveys also generate a plethora of spurious microbial taxa.</p>

        <p id="Par2">When this artificial inflation in the observed number of taxa is ignored, we find that changes in the abundance of detected taxa confound current methods for inferring differences in richness. Experimental evidence, theory-guided exploratory data analyses, and existing literature support the conclusion that most sub-genus discoveries are spurious artifacts of clustering 16S sequencing reads. We proceed to model a 16S survey’s systematic patterns of sub-genus taxa generation as a function of genus abundance to derive a robust control for false taxa accumulation.

    <title>Background</title>
    <p id="Par5">Clinically relevant health outcomes are often accompanied by changes in the diversity of associated microbial communities. For instance, decreased gut microbiome diversity accompanies childhood diarrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and enteric infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and has been shown to predict the onset of infant type I diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Distinct intra-tumoral microbial diversity levels are associated with cancer sub-types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Thus, inferring disease associated changes in microbiome diversity metrics is useful for characterizing disease pathology and progression.</p>
    <p id="Par6">Among the various diversity measures, <italic>richness</italic> quantifies the number of taxonomic groups in a community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Changes in species richness of biological communities have informed key environmental management practices that are relevant to public health and well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Of the technologies available for characterizing microbial communities, 16S rRNA (ribosomal RNA) gene surveys are widely adopted for their high throughput and low cost. As a broad screening tool, they largely avoid the need for laborious culturing of microbes. This makes them especially attractive for deriving health metrics based on the microbiome.</p>
    <p id="Par7">In this work, we focus on inferring changes in richness of microbial communities between sample groups (i.e., differential richness) with 16S survey data.</p>
    <p id="Par8">To infer differential richness, one first estimates richness for the specific communities of interest in each survey sample. The estimated values are then compared between sample groups with either fixed or mixed effects models, or with non-parametric statistical tests, possibly adjusting for sampling effort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. There are two types of sample-level estimates of richness. <italic>Observed</italic> richness refers to the number of taxa observed in a sample. <italic>Asymptotic</italic> richness is obtained by adding an estimate of the number of unobserved taxa to the number of observed taxa. Approaches to estimate asymptotic richness vary, but often assume that relatively uncommon taxa are the most informative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Both types of richness estimates enable valid comparisons among <italic>macro</italic>-ecological communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par9">However, direct application of the aforementioned richness estimates and comparisons to 16S microbiome data would ignore the plethora of uncommon and spurious taxa that inflate observed richness estimates in 16S survey data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. When this artificial inflation in observed richness is ignored, we find that differential abundance of detected taxa confounds current methods for differential richness inference. The problem is severe when between-sample richness comparisons are made at lower taxonomic levels, e.g., genus. Thus, direct application of classical methods to microbiome differential richness inference is unreliable.</p>
    <p id="Par10">Attempts to overcome sequencing noise have been made. Chiu and Chao [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], noting that singleton taxa are highly susceptible to sequencing noise, establish an improved estimator for counting singleton taxa by relying on more abundant taxa (also see Willis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]). However, the estimator is often numerically undefined at lower levels of the taxonomy, and still takes most of the observed richness at face value.</p>
    <p id="Par11">Our results indicate that the observed frequencies of spurious taxa are determined by the output abundances of input sequences and thus need not be restricted to singleton frequencies alone. We therefore aimed to develop a flexible differential richness inference procedure for 16S microbiome surveys—one that would not only allow investigators to seek sample-wide richness changes across experimental groups (as is commonly done in modern metagenomics) but also within genera or taxa collections of any particular interest, while accounting for false taxa accumulations.</p>
    <p id="Par12">The paper is divided into several sections. The “Most sub-genus taxa in 16S surveys are likely technical artifacts” section, based on our own experiments and exploratory data analyses guided by theory, presents multiple lines of evidence supporting the view that most sub-genus taxa currently identified in 16S surveys are spurious. This allows us to exploit within-genus taxa accumulation data to derive a robust control for false taxa accumulations (the “<xref rid="Sec24" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section). The “Spurious taxa confound differential richness inference” section illustrates the confounded differential richness inferences arising from current methods, when detected taxa exhibit a net non-zero relative abundance fold change between sample-groups. The “Prokounter enables flexible differential richness inference” section applies the proposed procedure (<italic>Prokounter</italic>) to a variety of datasets and illustrates the value that differential richness inferences at lower taxonomic levels add to clinical and public health-related microbiome data analyses. For example, application of <italic>Prokounter</italic> to a gut microbiome survey of a traveling individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] identifies the invading genera with increased richness in member taxa, during and after an enteric infection.</p>

      <p id="Par13">16S surveys reconstruct target microbial populations by clustering sequencing reads. Spurious microbial taxa occur when the clustering procedure’s error model fails to capture the entirety of sequence variation induced by the technical steps in 16S sequencing. These steps include, but are not limited to, PCR amplification of 16S material and sequencing (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Within-genus false taxa accumulation structure. <bold>A</bold> Sequences in input samples are subjected to various technical steps during 16S sequencing (gray shade). The output reads from 16S sequencing are clustered for sequence similarity using a methodology of choice. Of the number of taxa (clusters) thus reconstructed, some are true, i.e., equal in sequence to those in the input sample, the rest are spurious i.e., false (red). <bold>B</bold> For every genus, the accumulation is determined as a function of its recovered abundances. Notation: <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub><sup>0</sup> the respective true number of taxa associated (true richness), <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub>the genus recovered abundance, <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>(·) the abundance dependent technical component driving false taxa accumulations within-genus</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13059_2022_2722_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par14">To identify the major parameters underlying false taxa accumulations, we mathematically model the nucleotide substitution errors introduced by a chain of PCR amplification and sequencing processes allowing for back mutations (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]). Under reasonable assumptions, we find that the rate of falsely classifying an error variant of a source sequence (type I error) using a priori fixed sequence similarity thresholds strongly increases with the source sequence’s recovered (i.e., output) abundance. The average recovered abundance is multiplicative in the source sequence’s apparent input abundance and the total sampling depth (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Thus, false sequence clustering decisions, and hence the resulting false clusters, increasingly accumulate with the true source sequence’s recovered abundance and not necessarily sample depth. We therefore identify a mechanism through which spurious clusters of sequences are increasingly identified as microbial taxa, regardless of the underlying biological reality.</p>
      <p id="Par15">Given the empirical observation that 16S genetic segments are mostly limited in resolution to prokaryotic genera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], we explored within-genus taxa accumulations (i.e., the number of detected sub-genus taxa as a function of recovered genus abundances), in several publicly available 16S surveys. In general, we expect genera to vary in their true richness and the relative abundances of member taxa. This must accordingly induce biological variation in the genus-specific taxa accumulation patterns. However, this expectation did not broadly hold in the several microbiome surveys analyzed here. Within-genus taxa accumulation patterns were highly concordant for several genera within study (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, Additional File <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S1-S3). Relative to the number of detected genera, which ranged from 60 to 400 across studies, a clustering analysis indicates that within-genus taxa accumulation data supports only 2–8 distinct accumulation patterns in each study (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S1). Multiple dominant genera can be clustered to the same accumulation pattern. In addition, relative to study specific covariates, a robust trend estimate of the within-genus taxa accumulation data explains the bulk of the variation in genus-specific and sample-wide taxa accumulations (Tables <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) in each study. Similar qualitative conclusions follow when genus recovered abundance is used as a predictor, instead of an estimated trend (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Tables S2-S3). Finally, these qualitative and quantitative attributes of the accumulation patterns were obtained regardless of the 16S clustering approach used (Tables <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). These results indicate a strong within-study regularity in observed taxa accumulations across genera and sample groups—as if most genera have similar taxa richness and evenness—suggesting a likely technical origin.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Concordant taxa accumulations across genera, confounded differential richness inference, and the Prokounter strategy. <bold>A</bold> Sample-wide taxa accumulations are visualized with respect to sample depth (left). Within-genus taxa accumulations are visualized with respect to the total recovered genus abundances for two gener a, i.e., the sum of the abundances of all taxa within the genus. <bold>B</bold> Differential richness log-fold changes (LFC, <italic>y</italic>-axis) track differential relative abundance fold changes (LFC, <italic>x</italic>-axis) in the waste-water treatment survey. <bold>C</bold> Prokounter exploits within-genus accumulation data to model false taxa accumulation rates.

        <title>Single colony experiment</title>
        <p id="Par16">To further verify these conclusions, we conducted a 16S sequencing experiment on a target <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> population. The experimental sample was by itself overnight derived from a single <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> colony (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In a series of experimental samples, we varied both the input abundance of Pseudomonas cells and the PCR amplification cycles. Our mathematical model (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), which tracked the probability distribution of cell division induced nucleotide substitutions over generations, indicates that under no selection pressure, we can expect one biological 16S genotype in our input. An upper bound on the number of our input taxa is given by the number of 16S genes generally found within the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> genus (~ 4), times two for taxa clusters corresponding to forward and reverse complement strands. What we found was a rather different representation, rich with low abundant and poorly replicating taxa: the total numbers of observed <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> taxa were 1050 and 300 for clustering methods based on sequence similarity with respective thresholds of 99% and 97% and 90 for a probabilistic clustering method (Dada2). The bulk of the newly identified <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> taxa preferentially contributed to the low frequency regime of the taxa abundance histogram (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S4), suggesting that they are likely clusters of rare, erroneous 16S sequencing reads generated during amplification and sequencing. Notably, taxa within-Pseudomonas, despite having a noisy occurrence with respect to amplification cycles and input cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A), accumulated along the Pseudomonas genus recovered abundance axis in a clear, robust fashion (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). As expected, the stricter the sequence similarity threshold, the stronger the rate of taxa accumulations along the recovered abundance axis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). Furthermore, taxa accumulations from several detected genera followed quantitatively similar patterns (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C, Tables <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). From prior experiments in our laboratory and from control samples, we know <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> lab contaminants have very weak relative abundances. Restricting the above analysis to only those Pseudomonas taxa that track input cells does not change the aforementioned conclusions qualitatively (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S5).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>False microbial discoveries accumulate along the recovered abundance axis in the Pseudomonas dilution study. <bold>A</bold> For each taxa clustering method, the observed variation in within-genus Pseudomonas taxa accumulations are driven by experimental and technical parameters.

        <p id="Par18">Because true taxa are expected to replicate across study samples, we explored sub-genus taxa occurrence rates (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S19). In all studies, we find that over 50% of sub-genus taxa in over 50% of the detected genera did not replicate in more than 10% of the samples. Mock experimental communities are expected to represent a greater degree of homogeneity than real world communities as the latter may contain rare variants. Restricting analysis to experimental communities with single- and multiple- mock genera, we find that in eight out of nine datasets, over 50% of sub-genus taxa in over 50% of the mock genera replicated in less than 50% of the samples (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S19). These results indicate poor within-study replicability of most sub-genus taxa.</p>
        <p id="Par19">Finally, because we expect true taxa richness and evenness to vary along the taxonomic tree, we explored taxa accumulations for the various taxonomic levels (i.e., family, order, class and phylum) in each study. Remarkably, the total number of observed taxa at any level of the taxonomic tree was strongly predicted by recovered abundance alone and was not dependent on the taxonomic level considered (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, S<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">20</xref>). These results indicate a strong regularity in taxa accumulations across taxonomic levels, suggesting that spurious taxa accumulations overwhelm observed richness statistics.</p>

      <title>Spurious taxa confound differential richness inference</title>
      <p id="Par21">That observed spurious sub-genus taxa increasingly accumulate with genus recovered abundances leaves us with two expectations.</p>
      <p id="Par22">First, without appropriate corrections, inferring differences in a genus’ number of associated taxa (i.e., genus-wise differential richness) are highly likely to be confounded by the genus’s respective difference in the recovered abundances (differential abundance). We observe that estimated genus-wise richness values from asymptotic estimators grew systematically with the genus-specific recovered abundances (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S6). In addition to observed richness, estimates of unobserved richness can exhibit similar behavior (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S7). This in turn induces an artifactual positive correlation between the resulting genus-wise differential richness fold changes and the genus-wise differential abundance fold changes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B, Additional File <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S8).</p>
      <p id="Par23">Second, inferring differential richness between sample-groups (i.e., sample-wide differential richness) are highly likely to be confounded by a net non-zero relative abundance fold change of detected genera. Straightforward simulations where spurious taxa are generated in an abundance dependent fashion illustrate this behavior (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S6). Interestingly, illustrative examples of the same were rare in several 16S surveys, suggesting that spurious taxa accumulations are comparable at the sample-level. Indeed, in many datasets, the relative abundance log fold changes of member genera were symmetric and concentrated around zero (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S9-S10). Nevertheless, exceptions with asymmetric relative abundance log fold change distributions exist and a case in point is offered by the long-term time series study discussed below (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S11).</p>
      <p id="Par24">In Additional File <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>, we model the abundance dependent generation of spurious taxa in 16S surveys within the sampling theoretic framework of Chao [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and Harris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], and find that the above observations agree with theory.</p>

      <title>Prokounter enables flexible differential richness inference</title>
      <p id="Par25">To overcome the aforementioned biases when applying current richness estimators to 16S surveys and to establish a flexible differential richness inference approach, we developed <italic>Prokounter</italic>.</p>
      <p id="Par26">While zero-truncated statistical models offer one route to modeling member inclusions in a population survey, the same can be achieved by incorporating appropriate predictors in a regression context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The former is the approach taken by some classical richness estimators to model species abundance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. We take the latter view and proceed as follows. Based on the results from the “Most sub-genus taxa in 16S surveys are likely technical artifacts” section, we assume that most sub-genus taxa in 16S surveys are false. This allows us to exploit a 16S survey’s overall sub-genus taxa accumulation trend, along with any systematic genus-specific effects, as a sampling effort dependent control for false taxa accumulation (Methods). This control is exploited within standard regression methods for differential richness inference.</p>
      <p id="Par27">With a few 16S surveys, we illustrate the insights offered by the proposed procedure, in achieving genus-specific and sample-wide differential richness inferences.</p>
      <p id="Par28">Unlike other estimators analyzed here (Chao1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], ACE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], Breakaway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], Breakaway_nof1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and Chiu-Chao [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]), the uncorrelatedness of Prokounter’s richness statistics with genus-wide differential abundance statistics is clear in each dataset (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C, S<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">12</xref>, compare to Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B, S<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">8</xref>). Breakaway and Breakaway_nof1 estimates were the most variable, often accompanied by wide confidence intervals. On several occasions, genus-specific differential richness estimates were not well defined in numerical value when using current richness estimators for numerical and not necessarily statistical identifiability reasons. Sample-wide inferences agreed among all methods in most cases, except when detected genera exhibited a net non-zero relative abundance fold change distribution.</p>
      <p id="Par29">Richness estimates produced by sequencing noise aware estimators Breakaway_nof1 and Chiu- Chao were well correlated with their basic counterparts Breakaway and Chao1 (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S21), implying that the confounded inferences observed with the latter are likely to be inherited. This was confirmed by simulations (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S6C). Visualizations of the behavior of Breakaway_nof1 and Chiu-Chao estimators (such as in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B) for genus-level inferences were not possible as both estimators were either mostly numerically undefined at lower levels of the taxonomy and/or suffered failed numerical convergence (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S22). For example, in the time series study discussed below, restricting to those samples where the Chao1 estimates were well-defined, the Chiu-Chao estimator was undefined for over 95% of the time. Because both Breakaway_nof1 and Chiu-Chao methods attempt to correct spurious singleton frequencies based on ratios of higher order frequencies (e.g., doubletons, tripletons), estimation issues arise whenever these ratios are not well-behaved. The above results indicate that these situations are not rare in 16S microbiome data.</p>
      <p id="Par30">In all surveys below, asymptotic genus-wise and sample-wide richness estimates heavily tracked their respective observed richness values (97–100% Pearson correlations, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figs. S13-S17).</p>

        <title>Pseudomonas dilution study</title>

        <p id="Par32">Increased amplification cycles can allow increased sampling of both contaminant and input genera. Thus, within further sampling constraints imposed by the multiplexed nature of the experiment, we expect sample-wide richness to grow with amplification cycles.

        <p id="Par33">It is well known that the abundance of lab contaminants falls with input loads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

In direct contrast, Chao1/Betta, ACE/Betta, Breakaway_nof1/Betta, and Chiu-Chao/Betta, confounded by input Pseudomonas’s increasing abundance, indicated a Pseudomonas richness <italic>increase</italic> with input cells (<italic>p</italic> = 0 for both) and Breakaway/Betta failed to reject (<italic>p</italic> = 0.251).</p>

        <title>Long-term time series study</title>
        <p id="Par35">Based on a clustering analysis of abundance profiles, David et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] identified that a distinct sub-group of the phyla <italic>Firmicutes</italic> replaced another <italic>Firmicutes</italic> sub-group, post-enteric infection, in the gut microbiome of an individual relocating to a different country. Prokounter refines this result further by identifying several Firmicutes genera (<italic>Faecalibacterium</italic>, <italic>[Ruminococcus]</italic>, <italic>Oscillospora</italic>) that are less rich post-infection. On the other hand, <italic>Dorea</italic> and <italic>Coprobacillus</italic>, members of Firmicutes, were found to have significantly increased richness in infection and post-infection samples. The genus <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> from the phylum <italic>Tenericutes</italic> was found to have significantly increased richness in samples collected during infection, while this was not the case post-infection. Thus, differential richness adds another state variable to the microbiome state specifications of the original study.</p>
        <p id="Par36">In David et al.’s dataset, sample-wide inferences disagreed among the methods compared. Relative to pre-infection samples, Prokounter generated inferences of reduced richness for both infection and post-infection samples consistent with antibiotic exposure. Chao1/Betta and ACE/Betta indicated reduced richness post-infection with a relatively weak significance for reduced richness in infection samples. Breakaway_nof1/Betta and Chiu-Chao/Betta indicated reduced richness post-infection but failed to reject the null for infection samples (<italic>p</italic>-value = .10 Breakaway_nof1/Betta, <italic>p</italic>-value = .16 Chiu-Chao/Betta). Breakaway/Betta failed to reject any of the corresponding null hypotheses (<italic>p</italic>-value = 0.99 infection and <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.74 post-infection), potentially owing to the very high variability of Breakaway estimates. As established in the previous subsection, these differences in inferences likely stem from the asymmetric differential abundance of detected genera in the samples collected during infection.</p>

The method indicates that relative to the effluent, sample groups from each of the post-treatment stages have significantly reduced microbial richness values. These results readily agree with our expectation of a publicly implemented waste-water treatment protocol. Chao1/Betta, Chiu-Chao1/Betta, and ACE/Betta produced similar results. While Breakaway_nof1/Betta failed to reject the null for inlet to pumphouse (<italic>p</italic> = 0.169), Breakaway/Betta failed to reject the null for sample groups corresponding to both effluent (<italic>p</italic> = .065) and inlet to pumphouse (<italic>p</italic> = .692).</p>

      <title>Summary</title>
      <p id="Par41">16S microbiome surveys reconstruct target microbial populations by clustering sequencing reads. Spurious microbial taxa occur when the clustering procedure’s error model fails to capture the entirety of sequence variation induced by the technical steps in 16S sequencing (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). We have shown that the false taxa thus generated not only inflates the estimate of a (microbial) community’s richness (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>, Additional File <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S6), but they also cause taxa differential abundance to confound differential richness inferences (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B, Additional File <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: S8). This occurs because every false taxon is generated through errors from one or a few true (i.e., input) taxa, and hence, their rates of production increase with the output abundance of the corresponding source taxa (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Based on our result that most sub-genus discoveries are likely false (the “Most sub-genus taxa in 16S surveys are likely technical artifacts” section), we have established abundance dependent controls for false taxa accumulations using a given survey’s within-genus taxa accumulation data (Methods, Fig.<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C, S<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>, S<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">18</xref>). We have shown that our strategy overcomes the confounding problem (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C, S<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">12</xref>). And we have illustrated the utility of differential richness inferences in individual and public health-related microbiome data analyses (the “Prokounter enables flexible differential richness inference” section).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec13">
      <title>Assumption</title>
      <p id="Par42">Our approach assumes that most sub-genus taxa in 16S surveys are spurious and are poor representatives of the underlying microbial community. We have provided several lines of evidence to support this conclusion: First, a mock experiment of an overnight derived microbial population indicated that observed richness can be severely inflated (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, S<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Our expectation was set in part by a mathematical model of cellular reproduction, where we tracked the probability distribution over substitutions, over generations (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Second, in a manner similar to what we would expect of low probability errors, most sub-genus taxa in both controlled mock and real world datasets are rare and show poor replicability across samples (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S19). Third, the total number of taxa observed for any taxonomic level was strongly determined by the category’s recovered abundance alone and was not dependent on the level itself (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, S<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">20</xref>). Fourth, within-genus taxa accumulation patterns in several publicly available datasets, including those from single- and multi-genera mock experiments, appear remarkably regular as if most genera in 16S surveys have similar richness and taxa evenness (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, S<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>-S<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>, Tables <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Additional File <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Tables S2-S3). Finally, the literature offers abundant support for abundance dependent false taxa generation in 16S surveys, of which we note a closely related few. Kunin et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] demonstrate the large number of false <italic>Escherichia</italic> taxa that arise in a 16S survey of a target <italic>E. coli</italic> population (also see Degnan and Ochman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], Pinto and Raskin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]). Based on the empirical observation that the number of false taxa generated are sampling effort dependent, Schloss et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] recommend that community-level comparisons be made at comparable sampling depths. Haas et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] illustrate the predictable, abundance-dependent generation of false chimeric taxa within genera in mock communities. Finally, consistent with our results on spurious taxa accumulations, Fouladi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] demonstrate the abundance dependent accumulation of 16S sequencing read error variants in microbiome datasets.</p>

      <title>Implications for richness theory and automated ecological surveys</title>
      <p id="Par43">False microbial taxa in 16S surveys arise because automated procedures to reconstruct taxa misclassify sequencing reads from their true types. Thus, in Additional File <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, we analyzed the influence of amplification and sequencing induced substitutions in causing misclassifications (also see Schloss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] and Sze and Schloss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]). In Additional File <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>, we mathematically modeled the false taxa that arise through misclassification and showed in part that a traditional asymptotic richness estimator (Chao1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]) is biased under this more general sampling scenario. The severity of bias is determined by sampling parameters. Together with the results mentioned in the previous paragraphs, we conclude that classical richness theory, which predominantly focuses on estimating undetected richness while assuming observed richness at face value, should be generalized for observed species misclassifications in modern high throughput and highly automated surveys.</p>

Our mathematical models and simulations that incorporate false taxa accumulations within the sampling theoretic framework of Chao [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and Harris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] indicate that such tracking can arise when the apparent richness (i.e., the true plus false richness) and not necessarily true richness is undersampled in a survey (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). This explains the observed tracking in the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> genus in the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> dilution experiment, where we do not expect undersampling of the true <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> community (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S13).</p>

      <title>False discovery control in differential richness analysis, confounding with differential abundance</title>
      <p id="Par45">Hughes et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] argue that traditional macroecological richness estimators continue to enable robust sample-wide richness comparisons in 16S surveys. Our analysis identifies exceptions (the “Long-term time series study” section) and clarifies the practical conditions under which controlling for spurious discoveries become important. In particular, we find that false taxa accumulations cause abundance dependent inflation in observed taxa numbers and their frequencies (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>), causing differential (relative) abundances of detected taxa to confound differential richness inference with traditional methods (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B, Additional File <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: S6-S8, S11). When spurious taxa accumulations are comparable across contrasted experimental groups, no such confounding arises (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S9-S10). Our empirical analyses indicate that such an assumption is too strong for making differential richness inferences at lower taxonomic levels (e.g., genus-specific) of a microbial assemblage (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Unlike human gene expression studies that enjoy a known nucleotide reference catalog to reconstruct gene expression, microbiome studies often lack a well-defined reference. Thus, microbiome studies typically reconstruct the target microbial population bioinformatically by clustering 16S sequencing reads for sequencing noise, with error models derived based on sequence similarity thresholds, or by modeling sequencing noise. However, arriving at accurate error models is hard in practice (e.g., higher order sequence dependence of errors is not modeled), and thus spurious microbial discoveries are bound to occur when typing several millions of sequencing reads (Additional Files <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). It is in this context that we find utility with our proposed differential richness inference method, which aims to estimate and correct for the generation of spurious taxa in highly automated micro-ecological surveys.</p>

      <title>Relaxing microbiome richness comparisons to taxonomic groups</title>
      <p id="Par46">Microbiome analyses frequently restrict richness comparisons to the entire microbial assemblage obtained in study samples (sample-wide richness inference). From the perspective of deriving health and ecological indicators based on community assemblages, analysis of a community’s finer organization levels is equally interesting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

      <title>Within-genus taxa accumulation structure and the trend estimator</title>
      <p id="Par47">Our results document reliable across-genera regularity in the patterns of within-genus taxa accumulations, across many studies and genus-specific experiments (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, S<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>-S<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>, Tables <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Additional File <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Tables S2-S3). We speculate that genus abundances, in contrast to sampling depth, more accurately track the sampling rate of false sequence variation in 16S surveys for at least two reasons. First, commonly exploited 16S rRNA target segments are limited in resolution beyond genus level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Second, genus recovered abundances, unlike total sampling depth, normalize for the sampling rates of distinct genera. This restricts us from mixing taxa accumulation statistics over truly disparate input biological sequences from distinct genera, while allowing us to preserve any systematic genus specific effects. We used a robust trend estimate of the within-genus taxa accumulation data to model spurious taxa accumulation (Methods, Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, S<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>-S<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The coherent accumulation of a large number of detected taxa translated to low estimation uncertainties. These curves were not necessarily linear in the recovered genus abundances (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S1-S3). The systematic genus-specific contributions to this trend can arise due to between-genera variation in both detectable true input sequence diversity (copy number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] or number of distinct cell types) and 16S sequencing noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p>

      <title>Emphasis on sub-genus taxa</title>
      <p id="Par48">We have exploited the characteristics of sub-genus taxa accumulations to estimate controls for the generation of spurious taxa in a microbiome survey. However, our results indicate that estimation of the needed controls could also be done based on higher order taxonomic groupings as they too exhibit similar taxa accumulation characteristics (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In principle, we may lose power in resolving genus-specific technical effects (as illustrated in Additional File <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S18), and this necessitates a discussion of two cases. First, if grouping of genera is made because of very similar/identical 16S sequences (e.g., Escherichia-Shigella), we may not need to account for individual genus-specific effects within the grouping, as sequencing errors are strongly dependent on nucleotide sequence context. Second, when taxonomic descriptions for sequences are incomplete or not available, based on the comprehensive work of Yarza et al. on rational taxonomic boundaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], we recommend a numerical measure of 94.5% sequence identity for typing arbitrary collections of 16S sequences to achieve a reasonable “Genus-level” grouping for estimation purposes.</p>

      <title>Abundance dependent control in bioinformatic sequence analysis</title>
      <p id="Par49">Beyond differential richness inference, there is a need for recovered abundance dependent control in other (meta)genomic sequence analyses, e.g., sequencing read mapping and taxonomic annotation, which exploit fixed sequence similarity thresholds. Probabilistic methods have a natural incorporation of abundance in clustering/mapping decisions. In all cases, however, poor error models would continue to drive false taxa accumulations. It must be noted that we have not analyzed false negative rates in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].</p>

      <title>Future work</title>
      <p id="Par51">There are several avenues for future research. First, an integrated estimation procedure of false taxa accumulation rates and differential richness fold changes would lead to more appropriate <italic>p</italic>-values under the assumed statistical models. Second, development of ecological richness estimators in the presence of species misclassifications would be a valuable addition to the literature. Additional File <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref> considers a simple but a useful special case. Third, 16S surveys on mixtures of microbial species with varied relatedness and controlled input richness levels would enable a joint characterization of detectable 16S resolution, taxa reconstruction algorithms, and richness estimators. Fourth, control for multiple testing over tree structured hypotheses can be incorporated if one wishes to automate hypothesis testing over taxa collections defined by subtrees of a taxonomic tree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Finally, all our empirical observations were based on a set of 16S surveys that operate over partial 16S gene targets. Because full length 16S surveys also involve amplification, and sequencing protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], we expect the qualitative nature of our results to generalize to such surveys, perhaps at a lower taxonomic level (e.g., species), and this can be explored.</p>
      <p id="Par52">Taken together, this paper significantly clarifies the dynamics of spurious discovery accumulation in 16S surveys, presents strategies for modeling their generation, demonstrates the need to control for the observed false discoveries in microecological surveys while deriving differential richness inferences, and offers a flexible practical solution to achieve the same.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p id="Par53">Estimates of species richness based on classical richness estimators are biased when ecological surveys include false species generated by misclassifying true species. In the specific case of 16S surveys, the rate of generation of false taxa strongly increases with the output abundances of true input sequences. Thus, changes in the abundance of detected taxa are mistaken for changes in richness by current methods for differential richness inference. The results in this paper lead to the conclusion that most sub-genus taxa in 16S surveys are spurious. Based on this finding, a flexible method for differential richness inference was proposed and was shown to the overcome the confounding problem. The paper clarifies the dynamics of spurious taxa accumulations in 16S microbial surveys and argues for the development of diversity estimators that adapt to species misclassifications in modern, highly automated ecological surveys.</p>
