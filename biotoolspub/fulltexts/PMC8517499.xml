      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Fungi are eukaryotes that inhabit various ecosystems worldwide and have a decomposing effect that other organisms cannot replace. Fungi are divided into two main groups depending on how their sexual spores are formed, viz. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. The members of Botryosphaeriales (Dothideomycetes, Ascomycota) are ubiquitous. They are pathogenic on a wide range of hosts, causing diverse diseases including dieback, canker, leaf spots and root rots and are also reported as saprobes and endophytes worldwide. As an important fungal group, of which most are plant pathogens, it is necessary to organize data and information on Botryosphaeriales so that scientific literature can be used effectively. For this purpose, a new website, <ext-link xlink:href="https://botryosphaeriales.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://botryosphaeriales.org</ext-link> is established to gather all published data together with updates on the present taxonomy of Botryosphaeriales. The website consists of an easy-to-operate searching system and provides an up-to-date classification together with accounts of Botryosphaeriales taxa, including colour illustrations, descriptions, notes and numbers of species in each genus, as well as their classification. Thus, readers will be able to obtain information on botryosphaerialean taxa through this platform.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Botryosphaeriales (Dothideomycetes) was established in 2006, to accommodate a single family, Botryosphaeriaceae (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Nine families—Aplosporellaceae, Botryosphaeriaceae, Endomelanconiopsisaceae, Melanopsaceae, Phyllostictaceae, Planistromellaceae, Pseudofusicoccumaceae, Saccharataceae and Septorioideaceae—were accepted in Botryosphaeriales by Wijayawardene <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). However, based on morpho-molecular analyses and evolutionary divergence times, the number of families accepted in Botryosphaeriales was reduced to six, namely Aplosporellaceae, Botryosphaeriaceae, Melanopsaceae, Phyllostictaceae, Planistromellaceae and Saccharataceae (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Endomelanconiopsisaceae and Pseudofusicoccumaceae were synonymized under Botryosphaeriaceae and Phyllostictaceae, respectively, while Septorioideaceae was synonymized under Saccharataceae (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Members of Botryosphaeriales are found worldwide, on many different host plants (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–17</xref>). They are endophytes, pathogens and saprobes and as opportunistic pathogens, they are of considerable importance to agriculture, horticulture and forestry (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). They cause severe diseases of economically important crops and plants leading to huge economic losses (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Botryosphaeria, Diplodia, Dothiorella, Lasiodiplodia, Neofusicoccum</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Phyllosticta</italic> are the major pathogenic genera in Botryosphaeriales. <italic toggle="yes">Botryosphaeria dothidea, Diplodia seriata, Lasiodiplodia theobromae</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Neofusicoccum parvum</italic> are associated with grapevine dieback worldwide (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Diplodia seriata</italic> has been reported as a pathogen on a wide range of hosts including eucalyptus, pine and stone fruits (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22–26</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Phyllosticta citricarpa</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">P. citriasiana</italic> cause freckle on banana and brown spots on pomelo, respectively (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). One species can occur on several hosts in the same country, and pathogenicity of a species can vary from one region to another (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). This reflects the importance of gathering data on these fungal taxa to understand disease epidemiology.</p>
    <p>Aplosporellaceae, Melanopsaceae and Planistromellaceae have immersed or semi-immersed multiloculate ascostromata, while those of Botryosphaeriaceae, Phyllostictaceae and Saccharataceae are uniloculate (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Asci are bitunicate, with a thick endotunica (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Ascospores are hyaline or pigmented, septate or aseptate, ellipsoid to ovoid. Conidiomata are pycnidial, uni- to multilocular, frequently embedded in stromatic tissue. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline. Conidia are hyaline or pigmented, septate or aseptate, thin- or thick-walled (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28–32</xref>).</p>
    <p>All newly published data, which usually provide detailed descriptions and illustrations of new records, new species, new genera or new families, will be used to update the database. None of the papers generally link data from all members of the order Botryosphaeriales. Up until now, some websites involving specific groups of fungi have been established, such as <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.facesoffungi.org" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.facesoffungi.org</ext-link> (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), <ext-link xlink:href="https://onestopshopfungi.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://onestopshopfungi.org</ext-link> (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.marinespecies.org" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.marinespecies.org</ext-link> (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), <ext-link xlink:href="https://fungalgenera.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://fungalgenera.org</ext-link> (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.dothideomycetes.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.dothideomycetes.org</ext-link> (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) and <ext-link xlink:href="https://sordariomycetes.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://sordariomycetes.org</ext-link> (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). However, there is no database on Botryosphaeriales. Therefore, in this paper, we provide a search method, designed to gather all the information about Botryosphaeriales into one website.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="s2">
    <title>The need for a Botryosphaeriales database</title>
    <p>Many Botryosphaeriales species are associated with diseases in branches, leaves, fruits and seeds of aquatic and terrestrial plants (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39–43</xref>). In recent years, in-depth studies on Botryosphaeriales have resulted in changes in the genus/family-level classification (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref>). Moreover, the number of publications and research works related to Botryosphaeriales species are increasing all over the world (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44–48</xref>). With the increased number of studies on morphology, ecology and especially DNA-based phylogenetics, more and more new species are constantly being discovered. However, there are still many aspects needing clarification, such as naming new species from environmental samples, resolving the opportunistic pathogenic nature and how to define species boundaries in Botryosphaeriales.</p>
    <p>Currently over 2300 species have been described in Botryosphaeriales in MycoBank based on morpho-molecular evidence (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Most of the members of this order have been scientifically documented. These publications on <italic toggle="yes">Botryosphaeriales</italic> comprise various aspects such as taxonomy, morphology, pathogenicity or evolutionary studies. Information on Botryosphaeriales taxa are scattered in over 1000 publications mainly as books and research papers. Hence, the intention of this website is to gather all data regarding taxa accepted in Botryosphaeriales into a single entity that can be updated as new information becomes available.</p>
    <p>The present website, <ext-link xlink:href="https://botryosphaeriales.org/" ext-link-type="uri">https://botryosphaeriales.org/</ext-link>, focuses on the Botryosphaeriales with the following objectives: (i) gather all scattered data of accepted Botryosphaeriales taxa into a single platform, (ii) provide notes on the recent changes in genera and species of Botryosphaeriales with updated taxonomy and phylogeny and (iii) provide a list of all literature related to Botryosphaeriales. Hence, this website will be the best platform to access information on the botryosphaerialean taxa easily with simple searches, thus reducing the time spent on searching for information.</p>

    <title>The Botryosphaeriales website</title>
    <p><ext-link xlink:href="http://Botryosphaeriales.org" ext-link-type="uri">Botryosphaeriales.org</ext-link> is a website dedicated to Botryosphaeriales taxa by providing an up-to-date account with descriptions, colour illustrations, culture characteristics, associated hosts, distribution and notes for order, families, genera and species. The website, <ext-link xlink:href="https://botryosphaeriales.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://botryosphaeriales.org</ext-link> will be updated periodically, keeping abreast of current literature. It is convenient for all mycologists and pathologists who need information about the history and current classification status of botryosphaerialean taxa. The home page of the website has a mailbox so that mycologists, pathologists or anyone else who use this website can suggest ideas to improve it.</p>

    <title>Construction</title>
    <p>All fungi in the <ext-link xlink:href="http://Botryosphaeriales.org" ext-link-type="uri">Botryosphaeriales.org</ext-link> are listed according to the latest classification (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Each entry includes the accepted binominal name, Index Fungorum number, Faces of Fungi number, MycoBank number, ex-type culture collection number, dry culture collection and herbarium number and GenBank accession numbers of available DNA sequences. This website is handled and inspected regularly by the head curator, managing curator, senior curator and three other curators with expertise on botryosphaerialean taxonomy and phylogeny (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

      <title>Home</title>
      <p>The homepage briefly introduces the objectives of the website and has links to highlights of information. Colour photos of Botryosphaeriales are displayed representing the key morphological features of this order (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The relevant information can be accessed easily using the search box located at the right top corner (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Beneath the search box, there is quick access to recent notes, recent genera and recent species. Clicking on these options opens the link in a new window (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).
