      <p>Studying biomolecular interactions is a crucial but challenging task. Due to their large scales, many biomolecular interactions are difficult to be simulated via all atom models. An effective approach to investigate the biomolecular interactions is highly demanded in many areas. Here we introduce a Structure Manipulation (StructureMan) program to operate the structures when studying the large-scale biomolecular interactions. This novel StructureMan tool provides comprehensive operations which can be utilized to study the interactions in various large biological systems. Combining with electrostatic calculation programs such as DelPhi and DelPhiForce, StructureMan was implemented to reveal the detailed electrostatic features in two large biological examples, the viral capsid and molecular motor-microtubule complexes. Applications on these two examples revealed interesting binding mechanisms in the viral capsid and molecular motor. Such applications demonstrated that the StructureMan can be widely used when studying the biomolecular interactions in large scale biological problems. This novel tool provides an alternative approach to efficiently study the biomolecular interactions, especially for large scale biology systems. The StructureMan tool is available at our website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://compbio.utep.edu/static/downloads/script-for-munipulation2.zip">http://compbio.utep.edu/static/downloads/script-for-munipulation2.zip</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Studying interactions between biomolecules is an important but challenging task. In recent decades, many efforts and progresses have been made to study the biomolecule interactions (Jones and Thornton, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; von Mering et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Li et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Zhou, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Such studies are in two categories: Predicting biomolecule complex structures (Pagadala et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>); and revealing the biomolecule interaction mechanisms (Jones and Thornton, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>).</p>
    <p>To predict the complex structures of biomolecules such as proteins, RNAs/DNAs, many algorithms have been developed based on some physics principals and statistic functions. Some of them are protein-protein docking algorithms (Gabb et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Chen et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Dominguez et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Li et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), protein-DNA/RNA docking algorithms (Tuszynska and Bujnicki, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Huang et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Yan et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), scoring functions (Chen and Weng, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Jain, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Huang et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Li et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2013a</xref>), etc. To reveal the mechanisms of biomolecular interactions, numerous methods have been developed to simulate the biomolecular binding processes. The two most challenging issues in studying the biomolecular interactions are that the size scale of the biomolecules and time scale of the binding processes. Traditional all atom molecular dynamic simulations can hardly simulate the binding processes of large biomolecular systems, such as capsid proteins binding to a viral capsid. In order to accelerate the large-scale biomolecule simulations, many successful coarse-grained models have been developed (Liwo et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Marrink et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Such coarse-grained models are in several categories: elastic network models, Go-like models, beads-based models (Tozzini, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Besides coarse-grained models, some multiscale methods have also been developed (Wang et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Li et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2016b</xref>). We have developed a DelPhiForce steered Molecular Dynamic (DFMD) method (Li et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2017a</xref>; Peng et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) to speed up the Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulation. The advantage of DFMD is utilizing the long-range electrostatic interactions in the MD simulations to accelerate the binding process. This DFMD method has been proven very successful in protein-biomolecule binding processes. Therefore, studying electrostatic interactions is crucial to investigate large scale biomolecular interactions.</p>
    <p>To study the interactions between two biomolecules in various perspectives, the ligand structure needs to be manipulated with respect to the receptor, such as shifted, spun, rotated around the receptor. For some large biomolecules such as viruses, many proteins are required to assembled a complete viral capsid. Studying such large complex structures need more comprehensive manipulations on individual biomolecules. Therefore, we developed a Structure Manipulation (StructureMan) program to manipulate the biomolecule structures. Four basic and two advanced structural operations were developed to manipulate the structures of biomolecules. These basic operations are developed for two biomolecules (a receptor and a ligand), which include separation, spin, rotation and perpendicular shifting between a pair of receptor and ligand. Furthermore, two advanced operations were developed to study the assembly of multiple biomolecules in pseudo spherical or pseudo cylindrical symmetry. The pseudo spherical operations, including capsid generation, capsid expansion and capsid detachment tools, can be widely used to study the viral capsid assembly problems. With StructureMan, users can easily manipulate the structures of a complex to study the electrostatic interactions for large systems, such as protein-protein interactions in a whole virus capsid or a large piece of microtubule. In this work, we applied the StructureMan on a viral capsid and a molecular motor, which demonstrated that this novel tool is very useful when studying large scale biomolecular interactions.</p>
    <p>Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) is a plant pathogenic virus which is composed of ~4.0 kb plus-sense RNA and 180 copies of capsid protein subunits (Hogle et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Wei et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>). These capsid proteins assemble into an icosahedral capsid with a diameter of ~330 Å. For the purpose of this work, the quasi-three-fold symmetry related subunits are grouped together and referred as one capsomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The viral capsid has been shown to have multiple functions in stabilizing the genomic RNA materials during viral assembly and protecting RNA and host-defense machinery (Cao et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In 2012, an expanded form of TCV was captured and considered to be a putative RNA uncoating intermediate (Bakker et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The expanded capsid is resulted from the separation of the capsid proteins. Having its multiple functions and dynamic nature, the TCV capsid is an interesting target for protein-protein interaction studies, especially in the studies of capsid assembly and viral infection (Sorger et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Wei et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>; Saunders and Lomonossoff, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). As suggested by transmission electron microscopy, the assembly of the TCV capsid is a progressive process where the capsid protein units continuously assemble onto the initiating structure until the viral capsid is completed (Sorger et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>). This assembly process is guided by interactions among the capsid proteins as well as their RNA genome (Sorger et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Wei et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>; Bakker et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Saunders and Lomonossoff, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In a recent studies, the wild type capsid proteins of TCV expressed in Cowpea Mosaic Virus-Hyper Translatable Expression system self-assembled into TCV-like particles (Saunders and Lomonossoff, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). These results suggested that the ability of these capsid protein assemble into the viral capsid is fundamentally essential in TCV's life cycle. Therefore, this study implemented the StructureMan tool to manipulate the structure of TCV capsid, which then facilitated our analyses that reveal the binding mechanisms among capsomers in the TCV capsid. Many interesting features are discovered and shown in the results and discussion section.</p>

    <p>Kinesins are a superfamily of molecular motors. Kinesins have vital cellular functions (Mandelkow and Mandelkow, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Endow et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Lee et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Tseng et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) in mitosis and become ideal anti-mitotic drug targets for cancer treatment (DeBonis et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Tao et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Nakai et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Traditional anti-mitotic drugs face two significant problems: (1) serious side effects (Jordan and Wilson, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Schmidt and Bastians, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>); (2) Strong drug resistance for some types of cancers (Kavallaris, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Recent works found that another promising direction of cancer drug design is targeting kinesins (Jackson et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Sarli and Giannis, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Huszar et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Interrupting the binding or motility of specific kinesins can block the mitosis and kill the cancer cells. Due to the variety types of kinesins (Vale et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>), kinesin targeting drugs will be more selective and also alternative to solve the drugs resistance compared to microtubule targeting drugs. Therefore, discovering and designing drugs targeting certain types of kinesins become a very promising direction for cancer treatment. Efficient drug design approaches highly demand the systematic understanding of binding and motility mechanisms of kinesins. Therefore, many computational studies have been conducted to study the molecular motors including kinesins (Li et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2016a</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; Li et al., 2017; Tajielyato et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). This work utilized StructureMan to study the binding mechanisms between kinesin and microtubule, which sheds light on the drug design targeting the kinesins.</p>

Furthermore, two advanced operations were developed to study the assembly of multiple biomolecules in pseudo spherical or pseudo cylindrical symmetry. These pseudo spherical operations, including capsid generation, capsid expansion, and capsid detachment tools, can be widely used to study the viral capsid assembly problems. For the purpose of demonstration of the advanced operations, the protein capsid of the TCV, and the kinesin-microtubule complex were chosen in this work because of their representative pseudo spherical (icosahedral) and pseudo cylindrical symmetry.</p>

        <p>With two separated coordinates files of the protein units as inputs, this tool would displace one of the two units in a user given distance away from the other. For clarification, one of the protein units would be fixed in its original coordinates and is referred as the fixed unit. The other protein unit would be manipulated to result in different positions and orientations and is hence referred as the manipulated unit.</p>
        <p>The tool first calculate the mass center of both proteins, <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>fixed</italic></sub>, and <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>manipulated</italic></sub>, by averaging the coordinates of each individual atom after weighted by their corresponding atomic mass (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Equations 1, 2</xref>). With the obtained mass centers, a vector <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mover class="overrightarrow"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⃗</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula>, form <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>fixed</italic></sub> to <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>manipulated</italic></sub> is calculated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Equation 3</xref>). This vector <inline-formula><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mover class="overrightarrow"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⃗</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> can then be normalized with its magnitude to obtain the vector <inline-formula><mml:math id="M3"><mml:mover class="overrightarrow"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>U</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⃗</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> that defines the direction of the separation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Equations 4, 5</xref>).

      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Rotation</title>
        <p>The rotation tool would rotate the manipulated unit around the fixed one by a user-given angle. This rotation operation can be carried out in xy plane (around z-axis), xz-plane or yz-plane as users prefer. Rotation in xy-plane is discussed here for a simplified demonstration.</p>
        <p>The tool will start by calculating the mass center C<sub>fixed</sub> using the method demonstrated in the section above. A vector, <inline-formula><mml:math id="M6"><mml:mover class="overrightarrow"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⃗</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula>, from C<sub>fixed</sub> to a randomly chosen atom A in the manipulated unit can be created (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Equation 8</xref>). The rotation vector, <inline-formula><mml:math id="M7"><mml:mover class="overrightarrow"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⃗</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula>, would then be generated via multiplying vector <inline-formula><mml:math id="M8"><mml:mover class="overrightarrow"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⃗</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> vector by a rotation matrix that included the user-defined angle for the desired rotation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Equation 9</xref>). This obtained <inline-formula><mml:math id="M9"><mml:mover class="overrightarrow"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⃗</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> is then applied on the x, y, z coordinates of the manipulated unit, generating a modified structure with the user-defined degree of rotation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Equations 10, 11</xref>).</p>
        <p>It is important to notice that the rotation of manipulated unit around the fixed one may introduce clashes if the atoms are closed to each other. Therefore, it is recommended to separate the manipulated unit from the fixed one to a proper distance upon using the rotation tool.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Spin</title>
        <p>This tool allows the spinning of the manipulated unit with the respect to its own mass center. Similar to the rotation tool, the spinning can be performed in any of the <italic>xy-, yx-</italic>, or <italic>xz-</italic> plane. Spinning the protein unit in xy<bold>-</bold>plane is discussed here as a demonstration.</p>
        <p>With the coordinate file of the unit to be manipulated as the input, this tool first calculates its mass center, C<sub>manipulated</sub>, using method discussed in section Separation. A vector, <inline-formula><mml:math id="M10"><mml:mover class="overrightarrow"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⃗</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula>, from C<sub>manipulated</sub> to a randomly chosen atom would then be generated and multiplied by a rotation matrix to generate the final spinning vector, <inline-formula><mml:math id="M11"><mml:mover class="overrightarrow"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⃗</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula>, using the method demonstrated in section Rotation. The final coordinates of the atom will be calculated using the spinning vector. As the operation being carried out in the xy-plane, the z coordinate of each atom remind the same as original. This process would be repeated on each individual atom within the protein unit and output their spun coordinates into a separate file. To avoid clashes, it is recommended to separate the manipulated unit from the fixed one to a proper distance upon using the spinning tool.</p>

      <sec>
        <title>Perpendicular Translation</title>
        <p>The perpendicular translation tool shifts the manipulated unit along the line that is perpendicular to the vector of mass centers in the selected plane. The translation in xy-plane is shown as an example.</p>
        <p>This tool calculates the mass centers of both protein units and the vector of mass centers, <inline-formula><mml:math id="M12"><mml:mover class="overrightarrow"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⃗</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula>, the normalized vector <inline-formula><mml:math id="M13"><mml:mover class="overrightarrow"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>U</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⃗</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula>, as well as the separation vector, <inline-formula><mml:math id="M14"><mml:mover class="overrightarrow"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⃗</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula>, in a similar manner to that in section Separation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Equations 12–15</xref>). The separation vector <inline-formula><mml:math id="M15"><mml:mover class="overrightarrow"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⃗</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> would then be rotated 90Å or −90Å to generate the final translation vector <inline-formula><mml:math id="M16"><mml:mover class="overrightarrow"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⃗</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> that contains information of the user-defined distance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Equation 16</xref>). Finally, this tool modifies the coordinates of the manipulated unit using translation vector <inline-formula><mml:math id="M17"><mml:mover class="overrightarrow"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⃗</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> to create a new structure which is translated along the line perpendicular to the mass center vector by a given distance d (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Equation 17</xref>). Similar to the rotation and spinning tool, it is also recommended to separate the manipulated unit from the fixed one to a proper distance upon using this tool in order to avoid any clashes.</p>

        <title>Capsid Generation Tool</title>
        <p>Many pdb files of multi-protein complexes deposited in Protein Data Bank (PDB) do not actually contain the coordinates of all the protein units within the complexes, making it inconvenient for researchers who study protein-protein interactions among multiple protein units. However, instructions on how to construct the missing units from the given units are given as BIOMT matrices (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Within the BIOMT matrices, the numbers of biomolecule to be constructed (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Column3), as well as the corresponding transformation matrices are provided (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Column4–7). Therefore, in order to generate the structure of all the individual biomolecule unit within the pseudo spherical (icosahedral) viral capsid, an input coordinate file containing BIOMT matrices information is required.</p>

        <p>Where the coefficients <italic>a</italic> to <italic>l</italic> are provided by the BIOMT matrices (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and <italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub>0</sub>, and <italic>z</italic><sub>0</sub> represent the original coordinates of individual atom in the given molecule. The calculation would be performed on all other atoms until the structure of protein unit is completed and output as a separated file. This process will then repeat with the next BIOMT matrix until all the required protein units are generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A,B</xref>).</p>
        <p>This tool can be applied in generating structures of individual protein units form any multi-protein complex as long as the BIOMT matrices are provided. As a demonstration, the initial structure of the TCV capsid was downloaded from PDB (ID 3ZX8), by which the structure of a capsomer and the BIOMT matrices were provided. Using the capsid generation tool, 60 copies of capsomer structures were generated and assembled into the native structure of TCV capsid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). These capsomer structures can then be collected for further studies, where the interactions among capsomers are investigated.</p>

        <p>The next tool allows the shifting of all capsomers away from the mass center of the whole capsid resulting in a viral capsid expended by a user desired distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
        <p>The first step in this operation is to find the capsid's mass center, C<sub>capsid</sub>, which would be done in a similar manner to the capsid generation tool. When determining the mass center of TCV capsid, this tool first calculates the mass center of the primary capsomer, and then transformed the obtained coordinates according to the given BIOMT matrices. Sixty copies of coordinates would be generated and presenting the mass center of corresponding capsomers in the TCV capsid. With these coordinates, the coordinates of the mass center of the whole TCV capsid can then calculated by averaging the mass center coordinates of its individual capsomer, as shown in the following equation:</p>

        <p>As a demonstration, a TCV capsid expended by 0.5R<sub>M</sub> was generated by shifting the individual capsomers 0.5R<sub>M</sub> away from the mass center of TCV capsid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).

        <title>Capsomer Detachment Tool</title>
        <p>This tool detaches a single capsomer from the viral capsid by a user defined distance. Compare to previous tools, this one will output a structural file of the shifted capsomer and the rest of the capsid in two separated files. The work flow of this tool is very similar to that of the expansion tool, except the expansion vector would only be applied on the chosen capsomer. The detachment distance can be user defined relatively to the mean mass radius R<sub>M</sub>. As a demonstration, one of the capsomer from TCV capsid was separated from the rest of the capsid from 0.4R<sub>M</sub> to 1.0R<sub>M</sub> in 0.1R<sub>M</sub> intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
        <p>Once the structures of the detached capsomer and the rest of the capsid are obtained, operations including spinning and rotation, can then be carried out for the purpose of investigating the interactions between the one capsomer and rest of the capsid during viral capsid assembly. After detached from the TCV capsid by 0.7R<sub>M</sub>, the capsomer was spun in the xy-plane (around z-axis) from −90Å to 90Å in 2Å interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>) using the spinning tool described in section Spin. The capsomer were also rotated around the rest of the capsid from −20Å to 20Å in 2Å interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>) using the rotation tool described in section Rotation.</p>
        <p>By detaching, spinning and rotating a single capsomer, different orientations and distances of capsomer with respect to the rest of the capsid were obtained, which can be used for the capsid assembly studies where the driving force can be investigated in a manner of mimicking the dynamic assembly process.</p>

        <title>Cylindrical Structure Manipulation</title>
        <p>The application of the manipulating tool can be extended in complexes where cylindrical structures are involved. One example is to mimic the kinesin motor's movement on the microtubule filament, which can be subsequently used in the investigation of kinesin-microtubule interactions during the cargo transportation. In this work, the complex structure of kinesin binding with microtubule is generated and described in our previous paper (Li et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2016b</xref>). However, the StructureMan tool can be used to any other microtubule and cylindrical biomolecules. With the tools described above, 4 different operations of the kinesin motor domain were performed: (1) shifted away from the microtubule by 5Å to 50Å in 2Å interval using the separating tool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>); (2) rotated around one chosen microtubule unit from −20Å to 50Å in 2Å interval using the rotation tool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). This rotation range was limited by the steric effects of the neighboring microtubule units; (3) spun from −180Å to 180Å in 2Å interval around the Z axis using the spin tool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). (4) translated along the microtubule from −80Å to 80Å in 2Å interval using the perpendicular translation tool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>); In each operation, the structures of kinesin motor domain with various distances and orientations were output separately and collected for DelPhi (Li et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2012a</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2013b</xref>) and DelPhiForce (Li et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2017a</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">c</xref>) calculation.</p>

      <title>Electrostatic Potential of the TCV Capsomers and Its Capsid</title>
      <p>The charge distribution on capsomers mainly has two functions: First, the electrostatic interactions among capsomers play significant roles in assembling and stabilizing the whole capsid structure (Li et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2012a</xref>; Salas et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Xian et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Second, electrostatic interactions between capsid and DNA/RNA stabilize the encapsidated genomic materials by neutralizing the repulsive forces between the DNA/RNAs (Bakker et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In this work, we mainly focused our investigations on electrostatic interactions among capsomers of TCV using the StructureMan.</p>
      <p>The electrostatic potential calculations from DelPhi demonstrated the charge distribution on the inner and outer surface of the viral capsid. The inner surface of the viral capsid is dominated by positive charges as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3c,d</xref>, which explains why the capsomers play crucial roles in stabilizing the packed genomic RNA in previous studies.</p>
      <p>On the outer surface of the viral capsid, negatively charged residues are distributed rather evenly through the whole capsid, while the positively charged residues are mostly located at 5-fold axis and 3-fold axes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). After one chosen capsomer is detached from the rest of the capsid by 0.5R<sub>M</sub> (50 percent of the particle mean mass radius), strong attractive electric field lines are present between the detached capsomer and the rest of the capsid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>), suggesting that the electrostatic interaction guides capsomers to build the viral capsid.</p>
      <p>To study the overall electric field lines among the capsomers for a whole capsid, the StructureMan was utilized to expand the capsid. This “expand” operation shifted each of the capsomers away from the rest of the capsid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3c,d</xref>). Electrostatic calculation of the expended capsid shown the electric field lines located at the interfaces of capsomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3c,d</xref>). High density of electric field lines were found among individual capsomers, indicating the present of strong attractive interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>). These attractive interactions were found throughout the viral capsid, which demonstrated the role of electrostatic interactions in stabilizing the whole viral capsid.</p>

      <title>Electrostatic Binding Force Between One Detached Capsomer and the Rest of the Capsid</title>
      <p>To further characterize the role of electrostatic interaction in the vial capsid assemble process, the electrostatic binding forces were calculated using DelPhiForce (Li et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2017a</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). With the structure generated from the StructureMan, the electrostatic binding forces were studied in various orientation and distances of the capsomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
      <p>While one chosen capsomer was detached from the rest of the capsid, DelPhiForce was utilized to calculate the electrostatic binding forces, which were represented by orange arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>. Note that all the force arrows are normalized to the same size in order to demonstrate their directions clearly. To compare the strengths of these binding forces, the magnitudes of these binding forces were plotted against the distance between the detached capsomer and its native position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), where the more negative value represents the stronger attractive binding force. Binding forces data at 0.3R<sub>M</sub> or less were not considered because of the possibility of clashes between the atoms. The binding force became neglectable after the capsomer was detached by 0.8R<sub>M</sub> or further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). The forces within the range of 0.4R<sub>M</sub> to 0.7R<sub>M</sub> are all attractive as the arrows point toward the rest of the capsid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). This indicated that the effective range of electrostatic forces between the capsomer and the rest of the capsid is about 0.7R<sub>M</sub>(~97Å), which suggests that the electrostatic binding forces guide capsomers from long distance during the viral capsid assembling process.</p>
      <p>The binding forces between the detached capsomer and the rest of the capsid were also calculated while the detached capsomer was spun (visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). If the capsomer was rotated around z-axis within the range from −45Å to 90Å, the binding forces remained attractive. When the capsomer was rotated from −90Å to −45Å, the binding force became repulsive due to the effect introduced by putting the wrong-orientated bulky S domain too close to the rest of the capsid, which resulted in strong electrostatic repulsive forces. This suggests that the electrostatic forces contribute in adjusting the orientations of the capsomers to the native orientations, which were more electrostatically favorable compared to the non-native orientations.</p>
      <p>Previous studies on viral capsids have demonstrated the interactions between an individual capsomer and its adjacent capsomers are crucial in the capsid assembly process (Salas et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Xian et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Here we focused on the interaction between one capsomer and the rest of the capsid. As the detached capsomer was rotated around the rest of the capsid using the StructureMan, the binding forces were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). The rotation was carried out within a range that the detached capsomer was still relatively close to the cavity created by capsomer detachment. As the arrows are all orientated toward the capsid, we conclude that the electrostatic interaction is again attractive between the detached capsomer and the rest of the capsid.</p>

      <title>Electrostatic Binding Force Between Kinesin Motor Domain and Microtubule</title>
      <p>Similar analyses of the electrostatic binding forces were performed with the kinesin-microtubule complex in which the kinesin motor domain was manipulated by various orientations and distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). As the kinesin motor domain was separated from the microtubule, the strengths of the attractive binding forces reduced and became insignificant when the distance reached 25Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). When the kinesin was separated from the microtubule less than 15Å, the electrostatic binding forces were exerted toward the native binding site on the microtubule. When the separation was in the range of 15Å−25Å, the binding forces were orientated to the neighboring binding site. This suggests that as the distance between the kinesin motor domain and the microtubule increases, the binding force toward the neighboring binding site becomes competitive to that toward the native binding site.</p>

      <p>While the kinesin was rotated around one microtubule within the range of −16Å to 10Å, the binding force was exerted toward the native binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). If the kinesin was rotated further than −16Å, the force became repulsive due to the steric effect from the neighboring microtubule units. When the kinesin was rotated to the top of the microtubule units, the binding force first became repulsive and then changed to attractive as it traveled close enough to the neighboring native binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). When the kinesin motor domain was spun from −10Å to 10Å (the motor is still in near-native orientation), the binding forces remain attractive. However, when the orientation of kinesin motor domain is significantly changed, the binding forces became randomly directed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). The results from both rotation and spin operations reveal that the electrostatic interaction favors the native or near-native orientations of kinesin motor domain, and when its orientation is altered, the binding force reorient it to the native orientation by providing a repulsive binding force.</p>
      <p>In the operation where the kinesin motor domain was translated along the microtubule, the binding forces were consistently exerted toward the native binding side within the range of −26Å−12Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). While traveling between the native binding site to the neighboring binding site, the binding forces were shown to be mostly repulsive. However, as the kinesin motor domain traveled closer to the neighboring binding site (from −70Å to −80Å, and 60Å to 80Å), the binding forces were again orientated toward the neighboring binding sites. These results demonstrate that the electrostatic interactions make a significant contribution in guiding the kinesin by favoring the binding on the native binding sites and rejecting the non-native binding positions. Our discovery on the electrostatic interaction between kinesin and microtubule can explain and support the thermal ratchets model for kinesin's motility (Magnasco, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Hwang and Karplus, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The electrostatic analyses in this study also match the previous results from Brownian simulations for kinesins (Grant et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>Understanding biomolecular interactions is crucial and fundamental to study the biology problems. Due to their large scales, many biomolecular interactions are difficult to be studied via all atom simulations. Here we introduce a Structure Manipulation tool (StructureMan) to offer comprehensive operations for the structures in large scale biomolecular interactions, such as interactions in the viral capsid and molecular motor-microtubule complexes. This StructureMan tool contains operations which can be utilized to study the interactions in large biological systems. Combining with electrostatic calculation tools such as DelPhi and DelPhiForce, StructureMan can be used to reveal the detailed biomolecular interactions. Two examples are demonstrated in the results and discussion section, which show that the StructureMan is beneficial when studying the biomolecular interactions in large scale biomolecular complexes.</p>
    <p>There are four basic and two advanced operations developed in the StructureMan. Note that these basic operations in StructureMan are different from those in existing visualization programs. Those tools in the existing visualization programs can shift or rotate a single biomolecule; However, these four basic operations of StructureMan take two biomolecules as inputs and do the operations between the two biomolecules. For examples, the separation tool in StructureMan shifts the ligand from the receptor in the direction of their mass center connection line, while the existing tools can only shift a single protein. If users want to shift a ligand from the receptor in the direction of their mass center connections, users need to calculate the shifting vector first and normalize the vector, then use the existing tools to shift the ligand. The rotation operation in StructureMan rotates the ligand around the mass center of the receptor. This operation cannot be easily achieved by the existing visualization programs. Instead, users need to write some script to complete such an operation. Advanced operations in StructureMan are even more comprehensive. For example, the capsid expansion operation takes one capsomere as input structure and generates a structure of expanded capsid in which every two adjacent capsomers are separated by a distance defined by the users. Such an operation is not in any of the existing tools. Another advantage is that the StrucrueMan is written in shell script, which can be easily used to handle large number of structures (such as a big number of frames from MD simulations).</p>
    <p>In this work, we first focused on investigations on electrostatic interactions among capsomers of TCV using the StructureMan. The charge distribution on the inner surface of the viral capsid indicates that the capsomers stabilize the packed genomic RNA, as observed in previous studies. On the outer surface of the viral capsid, strong attractive electric field lines imply that the electrostatic interactions guide capsomers to build the viral capsid. The “expand” operation shifted each of the capsomers away from the rest of the capsid, which reveals that the attractive interaction among the capsomers is a key factor to stabilize the whole viral capsid.</p>
    <p>The StructureMan and DelPhiForce were utilized to further characterize the electrostatic binding forces in the viral capsid. Results demonstrate that the effective range of electrostatic forces between the capsomer and the rest of the capsid is about 0.7R<sub>M</sub> (~97Å), which suggests that the electrostatic binding forces guide capsomers from long distances in the viral capsid assembling process. The spin and rotation operations in the StructureMan show that the electrostatic forces contribute in adjusting the orientations of the capsomers to the native orientations.</p>
    <p>Similar analyses of the electrostatic binding forces were performed to the kinesin-microtubule complex, where the kinesin motor domain was manipulated by various orientations and distances. The results suggest that when the distance between the kinesin motor domain and the microtubule increases, the binding force toward the neighboring binding site becomes competitive to that toward the native binding site. The calculations from both rotation and spin operations reveal that the electrostatic interaction favors the native or near-native orientations of kinesin motor domain. When the orientation of kinesin motor domain is altered, the binding force reorients it to the native orientation by providing a repulsive binding force. In the operation where the kinesin motor domain was translated along the microtubule, the calculations demonstrate that the electrostatic interactions make significant contributions in guiding the kinesin by favoring the binding on the native binding sites and rejecting the non-native binding positions.</p>
    <p>Besides the two examples demonstrated in this work, the StructureMan program is able to help the researchers to study many other large-scale biomolecular interactions. We expect the StructureMan to be combined with DFMD method (Peng et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) to investigate the biomolecular interactions in the perspective of molecular dynamic simulations in our future work. This novel tool provides an alternative approach to study the biomolecular interactions, especially for large scale biology problems.
