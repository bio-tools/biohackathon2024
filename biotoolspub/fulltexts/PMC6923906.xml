    <title>Background</title>
    <p id="Par19">A large number of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data sets have been recently generated to characterize the heterogeneous cell types or cell states in a complex tissue or biological process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Gene expression in a single cell is purely determined by the transcriptional regulatory signal in the current cell, which may vary drastically throughout different cells. Hence, a gene’s expression could display multiple regulatory states across multiple cells, that naturally form a multi-modal distribution, where each modality corresponds to a potential regulatory state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Many statistical models have been developed to model gene expressions for cells collected under different conditions or data generated by different experimental platforms, including Poisson (P), Negative Binomial (NB), Gausian (G), Zero Inflated Poisson (ZIP), Zero Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB), Zero Inflated Gaussian (ZIG), Mixture Gaussian (MG), Beta Poisson (BP), Zero Inflated Mixture Gaussian (ZIMG), Left Truncated Gaussian (LTG) and Left Truncated Mixture Gaussian (LTMG) distributions, among which some are designed to capture expression multi-modalities. In addition to the multi-modality assumptions, these models also differ by their assumptions used to model “drop-out” events, and error distributions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. We have recently developed a systems biological model to interpret the biological underpinnings of multi-modality, drop-outs and other errors in a scRNA-seq data. Our analysis and other recent works clearly suggested that experimental condition and platform bias should be considered while we select the best model to fit scRNA-Seq data, as they largely contribute to the variabilities of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, there is lack of a computational tool in the public domain for a proper model selection in a scRNA-seq data set and downstream differential gene expression analysis based on multi-modality model assumption.</p>
    <p id="Par20">Motivated by this, we developed a user-friendly R package, M3S, to (1) select the most proper statistical models and differential gene expression test method, (2) characterize varied transcriptional regulatory state, and (3) detect differentially expressed genes among given conditions, for scRNA-seq data. The tool can be generalized to bulk tissue transcriptomics or other omics data if considering multi-modality is necessary. The M3S package is available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/zy26/M3S">https://github.com/zy26/M3S</ext-link>.</p>
    <sec id="Sec2">
      <title>Implementations</title>
      <p id="Par21">M3S package imports two additional packages, “mclust” and “pscl”, for fitting of a MG model and estimating parameters of a ZINB model, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. For information on the latest versions of imported packages and functions, see the package’s DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE files (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/zy26/M3S">https://github.com/zy26/M3S</ext-link><bold>).</bold> An S4 class is used to store numerical properties of the input gene expression data. <italic>M3S</italic> is the main function, which implements model selection for each gene, and outputs a list contains the estimated parameters, model fitness, and <italic>p</italic> values of the goodness of fitting, given each candidate model. We have adopted a dynamic function call model approach so that future extensions will be convenient.</p>
      <p id="Par22">The core function <italic>M3S</italic> can be directly exported from the M3S package. The input of this function is a gene expression data matrix, where rows indicate genes/transcripts and columns indicate samples. The output is organized into a list, each element of which includes an indication of the most proper model relating to each gene/transcript feature in the expression matrix, as well as the complete fitting statistics of all examined models. Specifically, the <italic>M3S</italic> function first assesses several data characteristics by checking if the data is (1) nonnegative (2) with significant proportion of zero observations, (3) discretized, and (4) with negative infinite observations. Then based on the data characteristics, <italic>M3S</italic> provides data specific normalizations among (1) log, (2) log(X + 1), (3) CPM, (4) log (CPM), and (5) log (CPM + 1) transformations. After normalization, M3S fits each row with the selected models that can fit the data type, and selects the best one. M3S defines the best model as the most parsimonious one that significantly fits the observed expression distribution by using a Kolmogorov Simonov Statistics (see details in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1. Supplementary Note). We consider the models complexity is ordered as <italic>P</italic> &lt; NB, G &lt; ZIP &lt; ZINB, ZIG, LTG &lt; BP &lt; MG &lt; ZIMG, LTMG (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Due to the unfixed number of model parameters, the complexity between, MG, ZIMG and LTMG will be selected if the number of peak of one of the distribution is significantly smaller than the number of peaks fitted by the others, by using a Mann Whitney test.

      <p id="Par23">In addition, the M3S package offers the fitting parameters of the best fitted model and gives the most proper data normalization and differential gene expression test method for the input data set. The <italic>M3S.fit</italic> function enables parameter estimations for a given model. The <italic>M3S.test</italic> function identifies differentially expressed genes by hypergeometric test, and in detail, by testing whether samples falling under one peak of the multi-modal distribution significantly enriches pre-specified sample collections (See more details in the Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1.

      <title>Validation of M3S on simulation data</title>
      <p id="Par24">We benchmarked the M3S package on simulated data sets and four real scRNA-seq data sets. We first simulated data sets composed by features of the 11 selected distributions. For the simulation dataset, 100 features (random variable) were simulated on 500 samples from one of the 11 distributions. The simplest model that is with FDR of the Kolmogorov Simonov statistics larger than 0.1 is selected as the best model. We tested if M3S can accurately identify the corrected model distribution for each feature, and found out, M3S achieves a 96.35% accuracy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). The only distribution that M3S achive less than an 85% accuracy is BP, majorly due to a bias lead by the Gauss-Jacobi quadrature approximation of the CDF of the BP model. We further added a few “noise” features, each of which has a distribution other than the true distributions specified. It turns out that M3S has high specificity and can effectively identify the outlier features with an over 98.5% accuracy on average (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec5">
      <title>Application of M3S in detecting the multi-modality of expressions on real data sets</title>
      <p id="Par25">We further tested M3S on four real single cell data sets and one bulk tissue data, including (1) a T cell scRNA-seq dataset generated by SMART-seq2 platform, consisting of 11,138 cells (GSE108989) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], (2) a scRNA-seq data set of 4645 stromal, immune and cells in melanoma micro-environment generated by C1/SMART-seq platform (GSE72056) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], (3) a data set of PBSC generated by 10x genomics consisting of 4590 peripheral blood cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and (4) a single cell FISH data set of 347 cells and 20 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and (5) TCGA breast cancer (BRCA) RNA-seqV2 data containing 1091 breast cancer tissue samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These datasets cover three platforms for single cell expression and one for bulk tissue expression profiling that are most popular. Our analysis suggested that in general, LTMG is the best model for log transformed CPM data generated by C1/SMART-seq and SMART-seq2 platforms; ZIMG is the best model for the log transformed CPM data the generated by 10x genomics, and the MG is best for modeling log normalized data generated by single cell FISH and the TCGA-BRCA data (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d-h). These could be explained by the distinctions of different technologies used to profile and collect the data: (1) reads data generated under the C1/SMART-seq and SMART-seq2 platforms are often saturated, meaning there exists a minimal expression level representing a common experimental resolution for all samples, hence truncating the gene expression below the experimental resolution as in LTMG is rational; (2) reads data generated by 10x genomics are, however, always unsaturated, and the experimental resolutions are highly varied through cells, thus handing the varied experimental resolutions with Gaussian errors as in ZIMG performs better in fitting the data comparing to LTMG; (3) scFISH data are with multi-modality but a small amount of zero observations.</p>
      <p id="Par26">It is noteworthy that 55 and 37% of the genes in the (tested) SMART-seq/SMART-seq2 and 10x data have more than one (non-zero) peaks, suggesting the necessity of considering multi-modality in the single cell expression data modeling. In the TCGA BRCA data, our model identified that around 31.9% genes were best fitted by either the MG or LTMG model with more than one peaks, such as the ESR1 and PGR genes that are associated with the breast cancer subtype (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>i). We also evaluated the computational efficiency of M3S, and our analysis suggests that M3S can select and fit the best model for 100 features of 1000, 5000, and 10,000 real single cell samples in 618 s, 1022s and 7255 s, by using a PC with an Intel Core i7-7700K CPU (4.20 GHz) and 16G RAM.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec6">
      <title>Application of M3S on differential gene expression test for simulated and real scRNA-seq data sets</title>
      <p id="Par27">We applied the <italic>M3S.test</italic> function to identify differentially expressed genes associated with pre-defined sample classes in the T cell scRNA-seq data set. We compared M3S with MAST, which is currently one of the most commonly used differential gene expression analysis method for scRNA-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. One of our results clearly suggests that 160 genes are with more than one non-zero peak are significantly associated with CD8+ T cells (identified by using <italic>M3S.test</italic>, FDR &lt; 0.05), as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>j.</p>
    </sec>
  </sec>
  <sec id="Sec7">
    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par28">M3S is developed for gene-wise model selection, and particularly, comprehensive inference of the modality of individual gene’s expression in a scRNA-seq data. On 20 sets of single cell RNA-seq data generated by Smart-Seq/Smart-Seq2 protocols, we discovered that LTMG represents the best model for majority of the genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. On the other hand, for the drop-seq based scRNA-seq data, such as 10x genomics platform, the experiment resolution are varied throughout different cells as with the total captured counts. Our analysis suggests that ZIMG achieved best fitting for 10x genomics data sets. Considering the error of the lowly (non-zero) expressions are hard to be modeled due to the varied experiment resolutions, ZIMG model utilizes a Gaussian distribution to cover the variation of the errors of the lowly expressed genes. For a gene fitted with multiple peaks in a drop-seq data set, we suggest considering the zero expressions as well as those expressions falling into the lowest peak as insignificant expressions, while the rest of the expressions in larger peaks as different levels of true expressions.</p>
    <p id="Par29">Noting that the gene expression in a single cell is purely determined by the sum of current transcriptional regulatory inputs in the cell, the multi-modality of a single gene’s expression may suggest heterogenous transcriptional regulatory states of the gene throughout different cells. A group of genes consistently falling into a same peak throughout a certain subset of cells, would suggest that these genes may possibly be co-regulated by a transcriptional regulatory signal specifically in these cells. Hence identification of gene co-regulation modules can be mathematically formulated as finding submatrices, in which the expression of its pertinent genes on its containing samples are consistently classified to one certain peak of its multiple peaks. This can be solved by integrating <italic>M3S</italic> and <italic>M3S.fit</italic> functions with a bi-clustering detection algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
