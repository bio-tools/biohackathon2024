        <title>Background</title>
        <p id="Par1">This work aims to help develop new protein engineering techniques based on a structural rearrangement phenomenon called circular permutation (CP), equivalent to connecting the native termini of a protein followed by creating new termini at another site. Although CP has been applied in many fields, its implementation is still costly because of inevitable trials and errors.

        <title>Results</title>
        <p id="Par2">Here we present CirPred, a structure modeling and termini linker design method for circularly permuted proteins. Compared with state-of-the-art protein structure modeling methods, CirPred is the only one fully capable of both circularly-permuted modeling and traditional co-linear modeling. CirPred performs well when the permutant shares low sequence identity with the native protein and even when the permutant adopts a different conformation from the native protein because of three-dimensional (3D) domain swapping. Linker redesign experiments demonstrated that the linker design algorithm of CirPred achieved subangstrom accuracy.</p>

        <p id="Par3">The CirPred system is capable of (1) predicting the structure of circular permutants, (2) designing termini linkers, (3) performing traditional co-linear protein structure modeling, and (4) identifying the CP-induced occurrence of 3D domain swapping.

    <title>Background</title>
    <p id="Par6">To facilitate the utilization of circular permutation (CP) as a protein engineering technique, we carried out this study. CP, a polypeptide backbone rearrangement, could be considered as if the native termini of a protein were linked and a new opening created elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Studies on natural cases concluded that circular permutants (CPMs) usually retain their native structures and functions, sometimes with increased functional diversity or activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This property makes CP promising for bioengineering. By artificially creating CPMs, CP has been applied in various fields, such as studying the folding and function of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], improving the stability, solubility, substrate affinity, substrate specificity, and activity of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It can be used to create biosensors, molecular switches, and novel bifunctional proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Recently, it is also utilized to create split inteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par7">Despite being powerful, the implementation of CP poses challenges. First, CP is much more difficult, expensive, and time-consuming than traditional mutagenesis. Second, not every position is permissive for CP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Third, when the termini of a protein are distant, a peptide linker should be designed to connect them, or the CPMs are unlikely viable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Forth, conventional modeling algorithms are inadequate for predicting the structure of circularly permuted proteins. We have previously developed a viable CP cutting site predictor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of a 3D structure predictor and linker design algorithm for CP. Because of the rearrangement nature, when modeling a CPM, even state-of-the-art comparative modeling systems like the SWISS-MODEL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], RaptorX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], Robetta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and our work (PS)<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] usually generate a partially modeled structure. So far, uneconomic trials and errors are inevitable for CP bioengineering.</p>
    <p id="Par8">In this work, we have developed the first CP structure modeling and linker design method named CirPred (<underline>Cir</underline>cularly-permuted protein structure <underline>Pred</underline>ictor), which integrates several algorithms of protein structural computation, machine learning, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in a “circularly-permuted” fashion (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and “<xref rid="Sec19" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section). As tested with experimentally-verified CPMs of the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], CirPred was the only comparative modeling method capable of producing complete models. Evaluated with ~ 1600 pairs of CPMs from literature and the Circular Permutation DataBase (CPDB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], the average alignment ratio and root-mean-square distance (RMSD) between CirPred-modeled and actual structures were better than 90% and 2.5 Å, respectively, even for CPMs sharing ~ 20% sequence identities. On average, linkers designed by CirPred possessed 70.2% sequence similarities with native linkers. For proteins with amino (N)- and carboxyl (C)-termini closer than 10 Å, the linkers designed by CirPred achieved an accuracy of 0.26 Å. Interestingly, we found CirPred capable of detecting protein 3D domain swapping (DS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. When CP and DS co-occurred, CirPred provided accurate predictions of the structure and orientation of domains.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flowchart of the CirPred method. After obtaining the input data inclusive of a native template structure, a CP site, and a target sequence, seven major steps are performed. (1) The native template is processed to restore missing atoms and obtain the native amino acid sequence. (2) A pseudo-CP template structure and sequence are created according to the CP site. (3) A linker design procedure is carried out when necessary. (4) Sequence alignment between the pseudo-CP template and the target sequence is performed with native termini connected by the designed linker. (5) A coarse model is produced by comparative structure modeling. (6) The coarse model is refined by an algorithm that uses the CP site as a hinge to find the optimal orientation of domains (see “<xref rid="Sec19" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section). Each arrow represents a vector from the hinge to the center of mass of a domain. (7) Energy minimization and MD simulations are carried out to make the optimized model. In the web implementation, the linker design algorithm is activated only when the user does not provide the target sequence. In this situation, the target sequence is directly obtained from the template structure according to the CP site. The blue and red colors represent the N- and C-terminal proportions of a protein, respectively. The solid and dotted underlines indicate sequence fragments corresponding to the N- and C-terminal proportions of the native protein</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12859_2021_4403_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
    <p id="Par9">To fulfill the aims of this work, we implemented the CirPred into a rapid web server. With the assistance of this effective structure predictor, we hope that the time and cost of CP implementation can be significantly decreased, letting this powerful technique open protein and enzyme engineering to new possibilities.

      <title>Comparison of structural models generated by CirPred and conventional modeling methods</title>
      <p id="Par10">Since proteins related by CP have different start points of the polypeptide sequence, conventional structure modeling methods typically meet difficulties in finding suitable templates when processing a circularly permuted target protein. Even if the native protein of the target is provided as the template, they may still fail to build a full-length model. It is commonly observed that, delimited by the CP site, a part of the model is missing or predicted as extended loops/coils. In other cases, the model is predicted to possess two well-folded domains, but the predicted orientation of domains is incorrect.</p>
      <p id="Par11">The entire polypeptide of the DHFR had been scanned by CP to identify viable CP sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. According to those CP sites, we generated all the permutant sequences and submitted them to state-of-the-art comparative modeling systems, including SWISS-MODEL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], RaptorX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and Robetta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). When CP occurred at positions close to the center of the polypeptide, the quality of models built by these methods was generally good. As the CP site moved close to the N- or C-terminus, the missing, coiled, or incorrect-orientation modeling problems became increasingly serious. If a modeled permutant and the native DHFR were structurally aligned, the worst results (the lowest alignment ratio or highest RMSD) usually occurred when the CP site is situated around 1/4 or 3/4 of the sequence. The same permutant sequences were processed with the proposed CirPred method, and all the produced CPM models aligned well with the native protein. Take CP site residue 55 for example, the CPM model built by CirPred retained the correct conformation of DHFR (compare Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, b). As for the model constructed by SWISS-MODEL, the proportion corresponding to residues 1–55 of the native DHFR was missing (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). The same proportion was predicted as a long coil by RaptorX (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). Robetta successfully modeled the two proportions delimited by the CP site, but the predicted orientation was wrong (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Circularly-permuted protein structure models constructed by CirPred and conventional modeling methods. The CPM55 of DHFR has been reported viable (CP site on the native DHFR: Pro55) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Several comparative structure modeling methods were applied to construct the model of this CPM. Conventional methods failed to model part of the CPM (panel <bold>c</bold> and <bold>d</bold>) or produced incorrect domain orientations (panel <bold>e</bold>). The proposed CirPred method correctly constructed the full-length model (panel <bold>b</bold>). Structures shown in this figure include <bold>a</bold> the native DHFR (PDB 1rx4A), and the model of CPM55 constructed by <bold>b</bold> CirPred <bold>c</bold> SWISS-MODEL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], <bold>d</bold> RaptorX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and <bold>e</bold> Robetta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Structures are drawn in the same orientation and scale. The blue and red colors indicate the N- and C-terminal proportions, respectively, of the protein. The α-carbon atoms of termini residues are shown as spheres</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12859_2021_4403_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par12">CirPred was the only one capable of correctly modeling all viable DHFR CPMs among the assessed methods, demonstrating its specificity to circularly permuted proteins. Additionally, it is noteworthy that CirPred is applicable to conventional co-linear modeling. By setting the CP site to be residue 1 of a protein, CirPred would create a co-linear model with comparable quality to models constructed by state-of-the-art modeling systems. See Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> for results of co-linear protein structure modeling performed using CirPred.</p>

    <sec id="Sec4">
      <title>Comparison of models generated by CirPred and conventional modeling methods for proteins requiring termini linkers</title>
      <p id="Par13">When the native termini of a protein for CP were close, short poly-glycine or glycine/serine-rich linkers were frequently used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, longer linkers may be required for proteins with distant termini to be successfully engineered by CP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. We proposed a linker design protocol (see “<xref rid="Sec19" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section), which further differentiated the CirPred from traditional modeling systems. Here a linker redesign experiment was conducted to demonstrate how the proposed protocol could design a long peptide linker for proteins having distant termini.

      <p id="Par14">The 1,3–1,4-β-glucanase from Bacillus with Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 2ayhA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a) had been engineered by CP using Phe59 as the CP site, and the permuted structure had been determined (denoted as CPM59-β-glucanase; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We deleted residues 1–17 from the native β-glucanase structure 2ayhA to create a new N-terminus 21.97 Å away from the C-terminus. The truncated β-glucanase (denoted as β-glucanase<sub>∆1–17</sub>; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b) simulated a protein that possessed distant termini, and a long linker (17 residues) should be added for CP bioengineering. With β-glucanase<sub>∆1–17</sub> as the template, we constructed the model of CPM59-β-glucanase using several methods. If a method could properly design a linker for β-glucanase<sub>∆1–17</sub>, the designed linker should likely be similar to the fragment in the actual structure of CPM59-β-glucanase (the yellow part in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c) that is corresponding to the deleted residues in the native β-glucanase (the yellow part in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). The result showed that CirPred successfully designed a linker similar to the deleted residues in structure and sequence (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). The last 58 residues of CPM59-β-glucanase were missing in the model constructed by SWISS-MODEL (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e). As for RaptorX and Robetta, the long-coil and incorrect-orientation predictions exhibited in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> persisted. We had then utilized the actual structure of CPM59-β-glucanase as the template to construct the model of CPM59 itself using SWISS-MODEL, RaptorX, and Robetta. These algorithms either directly connected the native termini of β-glucanase by a twist (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f, h) or simply formed a big gap between the termini (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>g). It should be noted that only CirPred was equipped with a linker design protocol; therefore, the above comparisons were not made to compete with conventional modeling methods for performance but only to indicate the novelty of CirPred.

      <title>Large-scale assessments for various sequence identity levels</title>
      <p id="Par16">To examine how the modeling quality of CirPred would be influenced by the sequence identity between the target CPM and the template, we conducted an extensive test using CPDB, the largest dataset of manually-verified pairs of CPMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The 1568 CP pairs of CPDB with sequence identities ≥ 10% (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>) were grouped into subsets of decreasing identities. For each pair of CPMs, one was used as the template for modeling the other. The results are listed in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The quality of models remained high until the identity was lower than 20%. For those CP pairs with identities ≥ 20%, the average alignment ratios between models and actual structures were all &gt; 90%, and the average RMSDs were generally &lt; 2.50 Å. Even for those with identities &lt; 20%, the average alignment ratio and RMSD still reached 74.0% and 3.90 Å, respectively. For instance (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>), a RIM2 C<sub>2</sub>A-domain (PDB 2bwqA) and a calcium-phospholipid binding domain (PDB 1rlwA) shared only 19.5% identity. The model made based on 2bwqA as the template (CP site: residue 16) achieved a structural alignment ratio of 95.2% and RMSD 2.75 Å when aligned with the known structure of the target CPM, i.e., PDB 1rlwA. In summary, the performance of CirPred would decrease as the sequence identity between template and target lowers, but the quality of the constructed model remains high as long as the identity is not far below 20%.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Effects of sequence identity on the performance of CirPred</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Sequence identity<sup>a</sup> (%)</th><th align="left">Alignment ratio<sup>b</sup> (%)</th><th align="left">RMSD<sup>b</sup> (Å)</th><th align="left">Number of CP pairs</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">90–100</td><td char="." align="char">97.6</td><td char="." align="char">1.236</td><td char="." align="char">79</td></tr><tr><td align="left">80–90</td><td char="." align="char">95.7</td><td char="." align="char">1.673</td><td char="." align="char">39</td></tr><tr><td align="left">70–80</td><td char="." align="char">94.7</td><td char="." align="char">1.504</td><td char="." align="char">8</td></tr><tr><td align="left">60–70</td><td char="." align="char">95.1</td><td char="." align="char">3.124</td><td char="." align="char">10</td></tr><tr><td align="left">50–60</td><td char="." align="char">96.7</td><td char="." align="char">1.910</td><td char="." align="char">31</td></tr><tr><td align="left">40–50</td><td char="." align="char">98.7</td><td char="." align="char">2.002</td><td char="." align="char">236</td></tr><tr><td align="left">30–40</td><td char="." align="char">98.1</td><td char="." align="char">2.026</td><td char="." align="char">351</td></tr><tr><td align="left">20–30</td><td char="." align="char">90.9</td><td char="." align="char">2.496</td><td char="." align="char">161</td></tr><tr><td align="left">10–20</td><td char="." align="char">74.0</td><td char="." align="char">3.904</td><td char="." align="char">653</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>In this experiment, for each pair of circular permutants, one protein was utilized as the template to create the model of the other protein, i.e., the target</p><p><sup>a</sup>Sequence identities between the <bold><italic>template</italic></bold> and target proteins</p><p><sup>b</sup>Alignment ratio and RMSD values between the <bold><italic>model</italic></bold> and known structure of target proteins</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>

      <title>Performance of linker design</title>
      <p id="Par18">Connecting the native termini of a protein is a formidable challenge for successful CP engineering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A direct connection may be appropriate when the native termini are close in 3D space; otherwise, a well-designed peptide linker is required. There is still no general method for designing CP linkers in addition to short glycine/serine-rich peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In “<xref rid="Sec19" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section, a linker design protocol for CP is proposed. This subsection provides performance assessments of the proposed protocol.</p>

        <title>Evaluation with known circular permutants</title>
        <p id="Par19">A CPDB linker dataset (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>) containing all non-redundant linkers of CPMs from the CP pair dataset was prepared to evaluate the linker design algorithm of CirPred by performing a strict 500-round independent test described in “<xref rid="Sec19" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section. Statistical analyses showed that 99.0% of the CPM structures with linkers designed by our algorithm exhibited equivalent or lower potential energy than their original structures. The average sequence similarity between the designed and the original linkers was 68.6% (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref> for raw data and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Table S3 for statistics). Since all the original linkers were obtained from naturally occurring CPMs, these data indicated that the proposed algorithm could design linkers with structural stabilities and sequence compositions analogous to linkers that evolved naturally.</p>
        <p id="Par20">To dissect the influence of the distance between native termini on the performance of linker design, we further analyzed the sequence similarities and RMSDs between the designed and original linkers. As the distance between termini increased, the similarity lowered, and RMSD rose, indicating a decline in performance (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Fig. S3 and Table S3). However, since the output of the CirPred linker design procedure for a given protein was a set of candidate linkers ordered by potential energy, retrieving more candidates helped find better results. Take proteins with a termini distance ≤ 10 Å for instance, if the top 5 candidates were retrieved, the average optimal sequence similarity between the designed and original linkers was 83.7%, and the RMSD was 0.32 Å; if the top 10 candidates were retrieved, those values became 90.7% and 0.26 Å, respectively. Before this work, the most accurate linker design method accomplished a 0.50 Å RMSD out of 6 candidates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

There were 2141 CPMs in Dataset S, each with a known native protein and a predefined missing linker. After the machine-learning predictor of CirPred’s linker design module was trained with the CPDB linker dataset, every CPM in Dataset S was processed by CirPred modeling to redesign its missing linker. The potential energy of CirPred models was compared with that of the actual CPM structures. The results showed that 98.4% of the CPMs with linkers redesigned by CirPred had equivalent or lower potential energy than their original structures, and the average sequence similarity between the redesigned and original linkers was 71.7%. Since Dataset S was highly non-redundant and very different from the CPDB linker dataset (i.e., the training data for machine learning), this independent test demonstrated that the proposed linker design protocol was stable in performance.</p>

      <title>Ability to model 3D domain-swapped proteins induced by CP</title>
      <p id="Par22">As we evaluated the CirPred with engineered CP cases, a very interesting situation was recognized for the CPMs of βB2-crystallin with PDB entries 1bd7A and 1blbC. The crystallin 1bd7A was an artificial CPM of 1blbC with residue Glu87 as the CP site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Crystallin 1blbC, before the CP, was a homo-tetramer composed of two dimers, each of which was still a dimer comprising two intertwined subunits with an open conformation. The CP converted the <bold>inter</bold>molecular pairing between subunits into <bold>intra</bold>molecular pairing and thus disentangled the intertwined subunits into two side-by-side monomers with a closed conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The conversion between intertwined dimeric “open-form” and disentangled “closed-form” is an example of 3D domain swapping (DS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
      <p id="Par23">DS-related homologs are difficult for sequence or structure alignment methods to identify because of the dramatic conformational difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The identification of CP is also not straightforward [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. When CP and DS co-occurred, the situation would become too complicated for conventional modeling systems to construct a model of correct conformation, even if a proper native template was provided. One native βB2-crystallin subunit (182 residues; PDB 1blbC) contains two homologous tandem-repeat domains. Since the CP site 87 (which created crystallin 1bd7A, or the CPM87-crystallin) was situated close to the middle of the subunit, it would be expectable that conventional modeling systems construct a model of CPM87-crystallin that is similar to the native crystallin. Indeed, as Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> demonstrated, when the CPM87-crystallin sequence was input as the target and the native crystallin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a) as the template, SWISS-MODEL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] built a model very similar to the native structure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). However, the truth was complicated. The actual structure of the CPM87-crystallin (PDB 1bd7A; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b) had a very different domain orientation from the native crystallin. Thus, superimposition between the model built by SWISS-MODEL and the actual CPM87-crystallin structure showed a low alignment ratio (51.7%) and a large spatial displacement in the unaligned region (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d). Contrarily, the CirPred model of CPM87-crystallin showed a very high alignment ratio (99.4%) and a small RMSD (3.61 Å) with the actual CPM structure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e, f). The fact that CirPred could correctly model a 3D domain-swapped CPM implied that it has the potential of detecting the DS phenomenon induced by CP.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Modeling of proteins with 3D domain swapping phenomenon induced by CP. The structures of <bold>a</bold> the native βB2-crystallin (PDB 1blbC) and <bold>b</bold> the engineered CPM87 βB2-crystallin (PDB 1bd7A; CP site on the native crystallin: Glu87) have both been solved by X-ray crystallography. This pair of circular permutants is also an example of the 3D domain-swapping phenomenon. Since this crystallin had a two-fold rotational symmetric structure and the CP site was at the middle of the subunit, conventional comparative modeling methods might be able to construct the full model of the CPM by mimicking the template structure, such as <bold>c</bold> the model of CPM87 βB2-crystallin constructed by SWISS-MODEL using <bold>a</bold> as the template.

      <title>Web server of CirPred</title>
      <p id="Par24">The CirPred algorithm has been implemented as a web server providing three working modes, (1) structure modeling for a primary CP, (2) structure modeling for a highly modified CPM, and (3) linker design. On the input page, the user will be asked to provide a structure of the native protein and a CP site. If the linker had been designed, using Mode 1 is appropriate. If there are other sequence modifications (substitutions, insertions, and deletions) on the native protein in addition to the CP and the linker, Mode 2 can be a great help. If a linker is necessary and the user needs assistance in designing it, Mode 3 is applicable. CirPred will provide 30 candidate linkers with their CPM models ordered by the DOPE score. The final choice should depend on the user’s knowledge of the protein to be engineered. Distributed computation techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] are applied to speed up the execution of CirPred algorithms.

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par25">As a novel comparative modeling method, CirPred is fully capable of modeling circularly permuted proteins, even if the permutant shared a low sequence identity with the native protein. When a polypeptide linker is required to connect the termini before CP, CirPred helps design the linker. Besides, it could be applied to the design of 3D domain-swapped proteins by CP.</p>
    <p id="Par26">The novelty of CirPred was established on three bases. First, a pseudo-CP template was made before modeling. Second, CPDB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] provided valuable data for establishing the machine learning predictor of the linker design protocol. Third, the CP-site-hinged model refinement procedure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and “<xref rid="Sec19" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section) helped overcome the problems met by comparative modeling systems when dealing with circularly permuted proteins (e.g., incorrect domain orientation and expensive time cost). It also enabled CirPred to model domain-swapped CPMs.</p>

      <title>On the performance for low identity circular permutants</title>
      <p id="Par27">The quality of sequence alignment between the target and template is crucial to the accuracy of comparative modeling, especially when their sequence identity is low. It has been reported that for cases with target-template identity &lt; 40%, an error of ~ 4 Å would be introduced into the model by just a single-residue misalignment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Using CirPred, even when the identity fell to 20–40%, the RMSDs between the constructed models and the known structures of target permutants were &lt; 2.5 Å, and the proportions of structurally well-aligned residues between them were &gt; 90% (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). CirPred performed well at low identity because it utilized three global sequence alignment methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] to find the optimal target-template alignment according to the produced sequence similarity. Among those methods, (PS)<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] took the predicted secondary structure of the target and the known secondary structure of the template into consideration and was particularly suitable for making accurate target-template alignments. Notwithstanding its high alignment quality, the current implementation of (PS)<sup>2</sup> is dependent on a secondary structure predictor developed two decades ago and a traditional gap penalty scheme. If new secondary structure prediction strategies like [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] could be applied, or gaps could be dynamically suppressed within regions of regular secondary structure, buried core, or straight segments, the sequence alignment quality would be significantly improved and make CirPred more accurate for CPMs sharing &lt; 20% sequence identities.</p>

      <title>On the accuracy of linker design</title>
      <p id="Par28">We proposed a linker design algorithm to provide bioengineers with energetically-favored choices in addition to glycine-rich linkers. The performance of this algorithm should be owed to its “predict-and-refine” strategy. Even if the accuracy of the initial machine learning prediction of amino acid for each residue position of a linker was only 67.5%, the subsequent probability-guided random modeling and energy screening greatly increased the chance of finding suitable linker sequences. Nevertheless, if the absolute prediction accuracy could be improved, the quality of designed linkers might be enhanced. At least, the algorithm’s efficiency could be enhanced by reducing the number of random modeling (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref> for advanced discussions).</p>

      <title>On 3D domain-swapped circular permutants</title>
      <p id="Par29">DS is a quaternary structural phenomenon defined as proteins exchanging equivalent parts to form oligomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Understanding DS may help find new treatments for protein deposition diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and develop bioengineering technology to modify enzyme activities or create auto-assembling biopolymers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Since DS enables homologous proteins to have dramatically different conformations (open <italic>versus</italic> closed) and CP changes the location of N-/C-termini, if they occurred concurrently, obtaining a reliable model by conventional modeling methods would be improbable. The CP-site-hinge model refinement step of CirPred seemed to create a shortcut to overcome the difficulty in modeling DS-related proteins caused by CP. The combination of naturally occurring CP and DS has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and the βB2-crystallin we met in this study was an engineered case. These interesting examples implied that it is possible to create “circularly-permuted domain swapping” proteins to accomplish novel functions like molecular switches and auto-assembling biomaterials. CirPred is supposed useful for this combined type of protein engineering (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>).</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p id="Par31">We proposed a comparative modeling method for circularly permuted proteins to facilitate and broaden the application of CP in protein engineering. This CirPred method could accurately construct the model of a circular permutant at low sequence identity, indicating that it is promising for predicting the structure of a protein engineered by CP even if many other mutations are introduced. CirPred can design polypeptide linkers similar to the linkers of naturally occurring circular permutants. This ability helps ensure the viability of an engineered permutant that requires additional residues to connect the native termini. The model refinement procedure not only accelerated the search for energetically stable conformation for the domains delimited by the CP site but enabled CirPred to identify 3D domain swapping induced by CP. Thus, CirPred may assist in engineering “CP + DS” proteins with different biological properties, fusion sites, and oligomeric states from native proteins. Regular mutagenesis has enabled researchers to manipulate enzymes, antibodies, signal transmitters, cellular structural proteins, etc., for various applications. Circular permutation has brought about many novel engineered proteins that were difficult to create by regular mutations. We believe that many more protein engineering possibilities will be achieved by combining circular permutation with regular mutagenesis. As the first computational method capable of circularly-permuted structure modeling with linker design and co-linear structure modeling, CirPred shall help move forward various fields requiring protein engineering.

      <p id="Par85">For any residue in a known linker, in addition to feature values, the “answer” must be provided for machine learning. The answer in the case of linker design should be the residue’s amino acid, and thus there should be 20 candidate answers for learning and prediction. The computation loading of most machine learning algorithms would increase significantly as the number of candidate answers increases. Since 20 answers were beyond our hardware’s computation capacity, we classified 20 amino acids into three types (hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and neutral) and reduced the number of candidate answers to 3.</p>
      <p id="Par86">Previously as we studied viable CP sites, we developed an artificial intelligence system that integrated several machine learning, random sampling, and parameter optimization algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This system was applied in this work, and the recruited algorithms included bootstrap sampling, decision tree, and artificial neural network. After obtaining the answers and feature values from a set of known linkers, 250 and 50 bootstrap samples were made to train minor predictors of decision tree and artificial neural network, respectively. The final predictor was then formed by collecting the minor ones, which made predictions by vote. With this procedure, the probabilities of candidate answers for a given case could be estimated as the proportions of votes the answers received.</p>

      <p id="Par88">Since the 20 amino acids were reduced to 3 classes for machine learning, the predicted amino acid probability estimates were sketchy. Before these estimates could be used in the actual linker design protocol, they should be restored to 20 amino acids.</p>
      <p id="Par89">Linkers of the training dataset had been analyzed, such that for each class, proportions of amino acids were known. After the “class-level” prediction, the occurrence probabilities of 20 amino acids at a given residue were finely estimated using the equation,<disp-formula id="Equ2"><label>2</label><alternatives><tex-math id="M3">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <title>Length estimate of the linker</title>
      <p id="Par90">In our experiments, the length of a linker to be designed could be obtained from the alignment between CPMs. However, before using the CirPred server for linker design, the user might not know how many residues there should be in the linker. Hence, we proposed an algorithm to estimate the length of the linker to be designed. For a protein with a distance of N- and C-termini (represented by Cα atoms) &lt; 20 Å, the length of the linker would be estimated using this equation,<disp-formula id="Equ3"><label>3</label><alternatives><tex-math id="M5">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <p id="Par97">For evaluating this algorithm, proteins of the CPDB linker dataset with linker length ≥ 20 residues were tested with the DOPE energy score. The average difference in length between the known and designed linkers was 20.3%. The performance of this algorithm was acceptable; it was very time-consuming, however.

      <title>Refinement of the generated model</title>
      <p id="Par107">As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, a protein is virtually divided by the CP site (equivalent to the middle point of the linker of the native protein), i.e., the hinge, into two proportions. If the proportions have the same size, take the C-terminal proportion to be the small one. An axis <italic>r</italic> is formed between the hinge and the center of mass of the small proportion. Besides, a plane <italic>P</italic> is defined by these two points and the center of mass of the large proportion. Then, two kinds of movements are made to the small proportion. First, with the hinge fixed, rotate the small proportion on plane <italic>P</italic> with a pause per 20 degrees. Second, at each pause, rotate it around axis <italic>r</italic> with a snapshot per 20 degrees. There are 162 snapshots in total (180°/20° × 360°/20°). Finally, compute the energy score of these snapshots and select the one with the lowest energy to be the refined model of the CPM.</p>

      <title>Molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <p id="Par108">Molecular dynamics simulations were applied as a final optimization of the model. The model was submerged in a box filled with water molecules. When necessary, a suitable amount of Na<sup>+</sup> or Cl<sup>–</sup> ions were added into the box to neutralize the system’s charge. The neutralized system was first energy minimized before the full MD simulations, in which two rounds of annealing, each with temperature points 298 K, 320 K, and 298 K, were performed. Without applying the CP-site-hinge model refinement described above, the number of steps made in MD was set as 5 million, and the step size was two femtoseconds (total simulation time = 10 ns). If the model refinement was applied, we found that 0.5 million steps were enough to produce results with equivalent quality in terms of the alignment ratio and RMSD between the actual and modeled structures. In all modeling experiments performed in this study, both 5 and 0.5 million time steps were tested, and the reported data were based on the 0.5-million-step results. To reduce server machines’ loading, we set the default number of time steps as 0.1 million in the implemented CirPred server, and the user could change the setting.</p>
