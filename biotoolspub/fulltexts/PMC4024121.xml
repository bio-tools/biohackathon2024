        <title>Background</title>
        <p>It is well known that the development of cancer is caused by the accumulation of somatic mutations within the genome. For oncogenes specifically, current research suggests that there is a small set of "driver" mutations that are primarily responsible for tumorigenesis. Further, due to recent pharmacological successes in treating these driver mutations and their resulting tumors, a variety of approaches have been developed to identify potential driver mutations using methods such as machine learning and mutational clustering. We propose a novel methodology that increases our power to identify mutational clusters by taking into account protein tertiary structure via a graph theoretical approach.</p>
      </sec>

        <title>Results</title>
        <p>We have designed and implemented <italic>GraphPAC</italic> (<bold>G</bold>raph <bold>P</bold>rotein <bold>A</bold>mino acid <bold>C</bold>lustering) to identify mutational clustering while considering protein spatial structure. Using <italic>GraphPAC</italic>, we are able to detect novel clusters in proteins that are known to exhibit mutation clustering as well as identify clusters in proteins without evidence of prior clustering based on current methods. Specifically, by utilizing the spatial information available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) along with the mutational data in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC), <italic>GraphPAC</italic> identifies new mutational clusters in well known oncogenes such as EGFR and KRAS. Further, by utilizing graph theory to account for the tertiary structure, <italic>GraphPAC</italic> discovers clusters in DPP4, NRP1 and other proteins not identified by existing methods.

    <title>Background</title>
    <p>Cancer, one of the most widespread and heterogeneous diseases, is at its most fundamental level a disease brought on by the accumulation of somatic mutations
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. These mutations typically occur in either tumor suppressors or oncogenes. While oncogenic mutations either tend to deregulate or up-regulate the resulting protein behavior, mutations within tumor suppressors typically lower the activity of genes that prevent cancer. Pharmacological intervention has shown to be more effective with inhibiting activating oncogenes than with restoring functionality of tumor suppressing genes. Combined with the theory of "oncogene addiction", that many cancers are dependent upon a small set of key genes to drive their rapid cellular multiplication with the rest of the mutations simply being passenger mutations
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], the identification of driver oncogenic mutations has become of critical importance in cancer research.</p>
    <p>Due to the importance of this problem, several approaches have been proposed to detect naturally selected regions in which activating mutations occur. One general approach postulates that driver mutations will have a higher non-synonymous mutation rate as compared to the background level after normalizing for the length of the gene
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Similarly, assuming that the neutral rate of nucleotide substitution is surpassed when positive selection is acting on a specific region, one can check if the ratio of nonsynonymous (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>) to synonymous (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>) mutations per site is greater than 1
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Relatedly, Ye <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and Ryslik <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] showed that mutational clusters can be indicative of activating mutations and that finding such clusters is a way to reduce the driver mutation search space needing to be analyzed. An alternative approach relies on creating classifiers to categorize mutations. Machine learning algorithms such as <italic>Polyphen-2</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], which predicts whether a missense mutation is damaging, and <italic>CHASM</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], which discriminates between known driver mutations and a set of passenger mutations, rely upon a set of rules developed using a variety of machine learning techniques such as Random Forests
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and Support Vector Machines
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These rules can be used to calculate a score for each mutation based upon both sequence and non-sequence-based features such as evolutionary conservation, size and polarity of the substituted residue as well as accessible surface area
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Other classifiers, such as <italic>SIFT</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], use only a subset of these features, e.g. evolutionary conservation, for prediction.</p>
    <p>While the methods based upon background mutational rates have had some success in identifying regions of positive selections or driver mutations, they nonetheless suffer from several shortcomings. First, many of these methods rely upon calculating the difference between synonymous and non-synonymous mutations but do not take into account that selection can act upon minute regions of the gene. Thus, when the mutations rates are averaged over the entire gene, the signal may be lost. Second, the methods proposed by Kreitman
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and Wang
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] do not differentiate between activating gain-of-function mutations and inactivating loss-of-function non-synonymous mutations. Third, many of the machine learning methods require an extensive rule set that must first be trained using a well annotated database that is still limited. Until the requisite literature and information is developed, the machine learning algorithm is unable to create a well-performing classifier. Furthermore, the rules must be updated periodically to reflect updated knowledge and information. For a recent review of several popular methods that attempt to discern missense substitution effect on protein function see Gnad <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and Gonzalez-Perez <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p>
    <p>Building on the work of Bardelli <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and Torkamani and Schork
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], which stipulated that only a small number of specific mutations can activate a protein, Ye <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] developed Non-Random Mutational Clustering (<italic>NMC</italic>) to identify potential activating mutations. <italic>NMC</italic> works on the hypothesis that absent any previously known mutational hotspot, a mutational cluster is indicative of a possible activating mutation. This is based on the observation that most amino acid substitutions are either neutral or incompatible with protein function, resulting in a concentration of activating mutations within a small subset of protein residues and domains
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. For the null hypothesis that mutation locations are random in the candidate protein when represented in linear form, <italic>NMC</italic> identifies clustering by evaluating whether there is statistical evidence of mutations occurring closer together on the line than expected by chance. While <italic>NMC</italic> is able to implicate some cancer related genes, it is limited by the fact that it considers the protein as a linear sequence and does not take into account the tertiary protein structure. To account for protein structure information, Ryslik <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] developed <italic>iPAC</italic> (<bold>i</bold>dentification of <bold>P</bold>rotein <bold>A</bold>mino acid <bold>C</bold>lustering), which reorganizes the protein into a one dimensional space that preserves, as best as possible, the three dimensional amino acid pairwise distances using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. As described by Ryslik <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], utilizing the tertiary information is critical when identifying clustering as mutations that occur far apart when the protein is considered linearly can be very close together once the protein is folded in 3D space. The 3D proximity of such mutations might thus yield novel clusters. While it was shown that <italic>iPAC</italic> provides an improvement over <italic>NMC</italic>, the reliance upon a global method like MDS can potentially result in a distorted rearrangement of the protein, since distant residues will nevertheless have an impact on each other’s final position in one dimensional space.</p>
    <p>In this manuscript, we provide an alternative method to <italic>iPAC</italic> by remapping the protein into one dimensional space via a graph theoretic approach. This approach allows for a more natural consideration of the protein, one that is sensitive to protein domains and linkers. We show that our methodology is effective in identifying proteins with mutational clustering that are missed by both <italic>iPAC</italic> and <italic>NMC</italic> such as NRP1 and MAPK24. We also show that for some proteins, <italic>GraphPAC</italic> identifies fewer clusters than inferred by both <italic>iPAC</italic> and <italic>NMC</italic> while for other proteins <italic>GraphPAC</italic> identifies more clusters than the other two methods. While both <italic>GraphPAC</italic> and <italic>iPAC</italic> are an improvement over <italic>NMC</italic> since they account for tertiary structure, the differences between <italic>GraphPAC</italic> and <italic>iPAC</italic> point to the fact that different rearrangements of the protein must be considered in order to better understand the mutational clustering landscape. We show that many of the clusters identified by <italic>GraphPAC</italic> are also classified as damaging by <italic>Polyphen-2</italic> and as an activating mutation by <italic>CHASM</italic>. By providing a more complete picture of mutational clustering than <italic>iPAC</italic> or <italic>NMC</italic> individually, <italic>GraphPAC</italic> allows us to obtain a more accurate landscape of where potential activating mutations may occur on the protein.</p>

    <title>Methods</title>
    <p><italic>GraphPAC</italic> uses a four step approach to identifying mutational clusters. The first step, as described in Sections ‘Obtaining mutational data’ and ‘Obtaining the 3D structural data’, retrieves mutational and positional data from COSMIC
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and the PDB
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], respectively. After reconciling the mutational and positional databases (Section ‘Reconciling the structural and mutational data’), the residues are realized as a connected graph where each residue is a vertex whereupon the traveling salesman problem is heuristically solved in order to find the shortest path through the protein (Section ‘Traveling salesman approach’). Once the shortest path has been identified, the protein residues are reordered along this path providing a one dimensional ordering of the protein. The linear <italic>NMC</italic> algorithm is then used to calculate which mutations are closer together than expected by chance. Lastly, the clusters are unmapped back into the original space and the results reported back to the user. We detail each of the steps in the sections below.</p>
    <sec>
      <title>Obtaining mutational data</title>
      <p>The mutational positions were obtained from the 58th version of the COSMIC database that was downloaded via the following ftp site:
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/CGP/cosmic">http://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/CGP/cosmic</ext-link>. The database was implemented locally using Oracle 11g. Only missense mutations that were classified as "Confirmed somatic variant" or "Reported in another cancer sample as somatic" were selected, with nonsense and synonymous mutations excluded. Moreover, we only considered mutations originating from studies that were classified as whole gene screens. Next, since multiple studies can report mutational data from the same cell line, mutational redundancies were removed to avoid double counting the mutations. Lastly, only the proteins with a UniProt Accession Number
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] were kept in order to correctly match the mutational and positional data, resulting in 777 proteins. See "COSMIC query" in <italic>Additional file</italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> for the SQL code required to generate the mutational data.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Obtaining the 3D structural data</title>
      <p>The PDB web interface was used to obtain the protein tertiary information for each of the 777 proteins described in Section ‘Obtaining mutational data’. Since multiple structures are often available for the same protein, all structures with a matching UniProt Accession Number were used and an appropriate multiple comparisons adjustment (see Section ‘Multiple comparison adjustment for structures’) was performed afterwards. For proteins where the resolution provided alternative conformations, the first conformation listed in the file was used. Similarly, for structures where more than one polypeptide chain with a matching Uniprot Accession Number was available, the first matching chain listed in the file was used (typically chain A). Finally, after the chain and conformation were selected, the cartesian coordinates of all the <italic>α</italic>-carbon atoms were used to represent the tertiary backbone structure of the protein. While we only used the <italic>α</italic>-carbon location to represent the residue location in this paper, our methods are robust if any of the other backbone atoms are used including the amide nitrogen, main chain carbonyl carbon or the main chain carbonyl oxygen.</p>
      <p>Also, while X-ray crystallography was used to determine many of the tertiary structures in the PDB, we note that molecular dynamics (MD) could in principle be used to model the protein structure in solution. However, taking into account the time complexity of such an approach for larger proteins as well as the number of structures that we consider, such a task is beyond the scope of this paper
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Further, as crystal structures are almost always representative of the correctly folded protein, using the current structural information is more than sufficient until MD simulations can be applied on much faster time scales. See "Structure Files" in <italic>Additional file</italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> for a full listing of all the 1,904 structure/chain combinations used.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Reconciling the structural and mutational data</title>
      <p>In order to reference the same residue in the COSMIC and PDB databases, an alignment was performed to accommodate their different numbering systems. Like <italic>iPAC</italic>, <italic>GraphPAC</italic> allows two such reconciliations. The first is based upon a pairwise alignment as described in Pages <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] while the second is based upon a numerical reconstruction from the structural information available in the PDB file. Due to the fact that the PDB file structure potentially changes depending upon the structure release date along with other technical complications, pairwise alignment was used for all the analysis described in this paper unless specifically noted. For further information on the alignment please see the documentation in the <italic>GraphPAC</italic> package available on Bioconductor. Protein/structure/chain combinations that resulted in only one mutation or no mutations on the residues for which tertiary information was available were dropped. Similar to <italic>iPAC</italic>, a successful alignment of the tertiary and mutational data was obtained for 140 proteins corresponding to 1100 unique structure/chain combinations. See "Structure Files" in <italic>Additional file</italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> for a full listing and description.</p>

      <title>Traveling salesman approach</title>
      <p>Since the <italic>NMC</italic> algorithm requires order statistics to identify clustering (see Section ‘NMC’), we need to map the protein from a three dimensional to a one dimensional space so that order statistics may be constructed. Contrary to <italic>iPAC</italic>, which employed MDS, a graph theoretic approach is used by <italic>GraphPAC</italic>. As discussed above, one major limitation of MDS is that the minimization of the stress function:</p>

Further, selective pruning of the edges based upon edge distance is also often impractical due to the domain structure where many residues are close to each other. Because of these factors, we use a heuristic algorithm that solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] to find a linear path that is approximate of the shortest path through the protein. We then use this path as a representative reordering of the protein into one dimensional space. Unlike <italic>iPAC</italic>, which is based on a global remapping, this methodology takes into account only locally neighboring residues to remap the protein to one dimensional space.</p>

The difference between the three insertion methods rests on how the next residue <italic>k</italic> is selected for insertion. Under cheapest insertion, the next <italic>k</italic> to be inserted into the tour is chosen such that the increase in tour length is minimal. Under nearest insertion, at each iteration, the <italic>k</italic> that is closest to a residue already on the tour is selected. Finally, under farthest insertion, the <italic>k</italic> that is farthest away from any residue already on the tour is selected.</p>
      <p>These algorithms have different upper bounds on their tour lengths. For example, the farthest insertion algorithm creates tours that approach

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Due to the varied nature of these methods and that there is no biological justification to favor one over the other, we consider all three methods when identifying clusters and then perform an appropriate multiple comparison adjustment to infer the statistical evidence of mutation clusters (see Section ‘Multiple comparison adjustment for structures’).</p>
      <p>As can be seen from Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, all the rearrangement options present a positive skew and are mostly consistent with each other. For the majority of the proteins, all three insertion approaches as well as the MDS approach result in little rearrangement. However, if one method results in radical rearrangement when the protein is mapped to 1D space, the other methods do so as well. This makes selection of a specific insertion method less critical and for the rest of this manuscript, unless otherwise specified, we use the insertion method with the most significant cluster for analysis.

      <p>The above calculation is then performed on all pairwise mutations and an appropriate multiple comparison adjustment is then applied. For the remainder of this study, we use the more conservative Bonferroni correction
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] to adjust for the intra-protein cluster p-values. See Section ‘Multiple comparison adjustment for structures’ for a description of how we account for the inter-protein multiple comparisons. Lastly, it is important to mention that the structural information obtained for each protein does not always contain the (<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>,<italic>z</italic>) coordinates for every residue in the protein. In such cases, in order to compare <italic>GraphPAC</italic>, <italic>iPAC</italic> and <italic>NMC</italic> on an equal basis, these missing residues are removed from the protein.</p>
      <p>We also note that since we obtained our mutational data from COSMIC, some tissue types are more represented than others in the database. However, this scenario results in our analysis being more conservative and our findings even more significant. Assuming that mutations occur in different parts of the protein for different tissue types, when collapsing over all tissues a larger value of <italic>n</italic> is obtained while the values of <italic>i</italic> and <italic>k</italic> (as seen in Equation 2) for two specific mutations are not changed. This results in a larger p-value signifying that clusters found when collapsing over tissue types would be even more significant if only a unique tissue type was analyzed.</p>

      <p>In addition to the Bonferroni adjustment performed to account for multiple testing within a specific structure, we perform a second multiple comparison adjustment to account for testing all 1,100 structures. Since a single protein can have many structures that are similar to each other, a second Bonferroni adjustment is too conservative and an integrated Bonferroni-FDR approach was performed. Specifically, for a given protein, the Bonferrroni adjusted p-value of each cluster was multiplied by

Thus, <italic>p</italic><sup>∗</sup> could be compared directly to an <italic>α</italic>-level of 0.05 in order to determine the cluster’s significance. Next, a rFDR
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] approach, which is a good approximation for the standard FDR method when there are a large number of independent or positively correlated tests, was used. Under this method, the expected value of <italic>α</italic> is estimated over all <italic>k</italic> tests and then used as the significance threshold.

      <title>Method comparison</title>
      <p>Using the <italic>GraphPAC</italic> algorithm, out of the 140 proteins analyzed, 9, 10 and 12 proteins with statistically significant clusters were found under the cheapest, nearest and farthest insertion methods, respectively. This corresponded to 223, 225 and 226 significant structures (out of the 1100 total structures considered) under the three methods. It is important to note that failure to utilize the tertiary information results in either an over or an underestimation of the number of clusters in approximately 70% of the structures analyzed (see Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Hence, failure to account for the protein structure provides either an overly complicated or overly simplified view of the mutational orientation. On the protein level, as shown in Table
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, eight proteins were identified as having significant clusters by <italic>GraphPAC</italic>, <italic>NMC</italic> and <italic>iPAC</italic> while 7 proteins were identified as having significant clusters by only a subset of these methods. We note that of these seven proteins, four of them were only identified via the <italic>GraphPAC</italic> methodology while two of them were identified only via the <italic>iPAC</italic> methodology. We further note that <italic>GraphPAC</italic> identifies the largest number of proteins with significant clustering at the same false discovery rate, thereby showing an increased power to detect mutational clustering. We also observe that there were no proteins found to have significant clustering under the linear <italic>NMC</italic> algorithm that were subsequently missed by the <italic>GraphPAC</italic> algorithm. See Section ‘Cluster localization in relevant sites and performance evaluation’ for a summary of cluster overlap with active biological sites along with a performance evaluation via machine learning methods.</p>

      <title><italic>GraphPAC</italic> identifies novel proteins with significant clustering</title>
      <p><italic>GraphPAC</italic> identified four proteins with clustering that are missed by the <italic>iPAC</italic> algorithm: DPP4, MAP2K4, NRP1, and PSCK9. DPP4 is a serine protease that can modify tumor cell behavior and is a potential cancer therapeutic target
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Both MAP2K4 and NRP1 are well known to be associated with lung cancer
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Finally, while PCSK9 mutations are well known in causing hypercholesterolemia
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], recent research shows that absence of PCSK9 can provide a protective benefit against melanoma due to lower circulating LDLc. This allows for a potential additional cancer therapy via PCSK9 inhibitors [38].
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. For a full listing of which structure-protein combinations were found significant, see "Results Summary" in <italic>Additional file</italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>. Please see Sections ‘<italic>GraphPAC</italic> finds novel proteins compared to <italic>iPAC</italic> and <italic>NMC</italic>’, ‘<italic>GraphPAC</italic> identifies additional clusters compared to <italic>iPAC</italic> and <italic>NMC</italic>’ and ‘<italic>GraphPAC</italic> finds fewer clusters compared to <italic>NMC</italic>’ for an in-depth review of selected protein-structure combinations.</p>

      <title>Cluster localization in relevant sites and performance evaluation</title>
      <p>We note that 9 of the 13 proteins that <italic>GraphPAC</italic> identified as having significant clustering have their most significant cluster overlap a binding site, catalytic domain or kinase domain. Out of the remaining four proteins, three proteins have their most significant cluster fall within a previously identified biologically relevant region. For instance, IDE’s most significant cluster is located on residues 684–698, a denaturation-resistant epitope region
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. For NRP1, which plays roles in angiogenesis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and axon guidance
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], the most significant cluster directly overlaps the F5/8 type C 1 domain - a domain in many blood coagulation factors. Finally, for PIK3C- <italic>α</italic>, the most significant cluster overlaps residue 1047 which has been shown to potentially increase the substrate turnover rate, a common oncogenic behavior
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. For further detail on relevant biological site information, please see "Relevant Sites" in <italic>Additional file</italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>.</p>
      <p>Further, we evaluated the performance of <italic>GraphPAC</italic> via two well-known machine learning algorithms: <italic>CHASM</italic> and <italic>PolyPhen-2</italic>. It is critical to first note however, that the machine learning algorithms utilize a much more detailed set of features when evaluating the mutation. Thus these algorithms may identify mutations as significant while <italic>GraphPAC</italic> would not. Nevertheless, of all the mutations that fall within significant clusters identified by <italic>GraphPAC</italic>, 93% and 91% of them were also identified as significant (FDR ≤ 20%) by <italic>CHASM</italic> and <italic>PolyPhen-2</italic> (respectively). We note that <italic>GraphPAC</italic> is only able to determine statistically significant clustering and not whether a mutation is truly damaging and/or activating. However, given the high percentages described above, the evidence supports the hypothesis that clustering is in fact indicative of potential driver mutations. Thus, via <italic>GraphPAC</italic>, the researcher has a fast and easily available tool to identify potential driver mutations for further study. The benefit of <italic>GraphPAC</italic> is that it is able to be executed with far less prior information as compared to the machine learning approaches. For further details, see "Performance Evaluation" in <italic>Additional file</italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>.</p>
      <p>Finally, we note that while <italic>GraphPAC</italic> provides an improvement in cluster identification compared to prior work, the algorithm is unable to distinguish between mutations that increase or decrease kinase activity nor between gain-of-function (GOF) or loss-of-function (LOF) mutations. As described by Lapenna and Giordano
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], Brognard <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], Geiger <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], Ahn <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], Lisabeth <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and Linka <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], a large body of literature suggests that inactivating loss-of-function mutations are more common than previously thought and often occur in regions that regulate kinase activation. Nevertheless, as described above, many of the clusters identified by <italic>GraphPAC</italic> contain mutations that are classified as driver and/or damaging by common machine learning algorithms. As such, <italic>GraphPAC</italic> provides a fast and easy method to identify such potential mutations, which can then be verified and analyzed via additional approaches. These approaches can range from the aforementioned machine learning algorithms to experimental approaches that test for GOF mutations as described by Fawdar <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>In this section we discuss in depth some of the clustering results presented in Section ‘Results’. Specifically, we review in detail three situations: 1) <italic>GraphPAC</italic> identifies novel proteins (Section ‘<italic>GraphPAC</italic> finds novel proteins compared to <italic>iPAC</italic> and <italic>NMC</italic>’), 2) <italic>GraphPAC</italic> finds additional clusters in proteins identified to contain clustering by other methods (Section ‘<italic>GraphPAC</italic> identifies additional clusters compared to <italic>iPAC</italic> and <italic>NMC</italic>’) and 3) <italic>GraphPAC</italic> finds fewer clusters compared to other methods (Section ‘<italic>GraphPAC</italic> finds fewer clusters compared to <italic>NMC</italic>’). In each of these sections, we discuss the biological relevance of our findings.</p>
    <sec>
      <title><italic>GraphPAC</italic> finds novel proteins compared to <italic>iPAC</italic> and <italic>NMC</italic></title>
      <p>As shown in Table
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, <italic>GraphPAC</italic> identified five additional proteins as compared to the linear <italic>NMC</italic> algorithm. In this section we will consider two of these proteins, both of which are directly related to cancer: EGFR, which is also identified by <italic>iPAC</italic>, and NRP1, which is not identified by <italic>iPAC</italic>.</p>
      <p>EGFR is a cell-surface receptor for ligands in the epidermal growth factor family
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] and is present in a wide range of diseases such as glioblastoma multiforme
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], lung adenocarcinoma
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] and colorectal cancer
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The most significant cluster found was in the 2ITX structure
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] between residues 719–768 (see Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) with a corresponding p-value of 0.0009. This cluster contains mutations G719S, T751I and S768I which are all found in non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] with mutation G719S well known for increased kinase activity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. It is also interesting to note that all three mutations within this cluster, which was identified purely through statistical clustering analysis, show a beneficial clinical response to either Erlotinib or Getfinib

Exclusion of the tertiary information would have resulted in this cluster being missed. Finally, it is worth noting that recent research has shown that signaling by EGFR is dependent upon an allosteric interaction between two kinase domains in an asymmetric dimer as opposed to phosphorylation. As the formation of this asymmetric dimer is believed to activate all EGFR family members, it is likely that oncogenic activation of EGFR may differ from other protein kinases

      <p>We now consider the NRP-1 protein, a coreceptor for the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which is upregulated in a large variety of cancers including lung tumors
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], gastrointestinal metasteses
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>] and pancreatic carcinomas
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. In NSCLC patients, it has been shown to be an independent predictor of cancer relapse and reduced survival as well as a cancer invasion enhancer
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. Moreover, research has shown that NRP-1 inhibitors provide an additive effect to anti-VEGF therapy in reducing tumor progression. Monoclonal antibodies that attach to the b1-b2 domains, the domains responsible for VEGF binding, have already been created
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. The b1 domain, which spans residues 275–424 almost exactly overlaps the most significant cluster found by <italic>GraphPAC</italic>, which consists of residues 277–432 (p-value 0.0158) in the 2QQI

      <p>A representative example where <italic>GraphPAC</italic> identifies additional clusters as compared to <italic>NMC</italic> and <italic>iPAC</italic> is in the KRAS protein for the 3GFT structure<sup>c</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>] (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). KRAS, a GTPase, is one of the most pervasively activated oncogenes, with some estimates stating that between 17–25% of all human tumors contain an activating mutation of the gene
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Due to the large number of samples with mutations in this gene and the resulting strong statistical signal, <italic>GraphPAC</italic>, <italic>iPAC</italic> and <italic>NMC</italic> all identify that KRAS contains highly statistically significant mutational clusters. Nevertheless, <italic>GraphPAC</italic> identifies several novel clusters that are missed by <italic>iPAC</italic> and NMC. While all three methods identify clustering at residues 12–13, 12–61 and 12–146, only <italic>iPAC</italic> and <italic>GraphPAC</italic> identify two additional clusters at 1) 61–117 and 2) 117–146.</p>

      <p>As seen from Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, between 25%–40% of the structures identified with significant clustering had fewer clusters under the <italic>GraphPAC</italic> methodology as compared to the linear <italic>NMC</italic> algorithm with the vast majority of these structures corresponding to BRAF, HRAS and TP53.

      <p>Although it is outside the scope of this manuscript to consider every difference between Tables
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>a and
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>b, we observe that three of the longest clusters 464–671, 466–671 and 469–671 are dropped by <italic>GraphPAC</italic>. Since after alignment of the protein structural data to the mutational data (see Section ‘Obtaining the 3D structural data’), tertiary information was available on residues 448–603 and 610–723, these clusters cover 77.0%, 76.3% and 75.2% of all the available residues, respectively. By considering the 3D structure via <italic>GraphPAC</italic>, the longest clusters are dropped and the remaining overlapping clusters focus almost exclusively on residues 464–600.</p>
      <p>After structure and mutation alignment, the residue substitutions in significant clusters include: G464V, G466V, G469V, G469A, N581S, G596R, L597V, LV597R, V600E, V600K, K601N and R671Q. Since mutation R671Q does not have extensive literature and comes from a non-specified tissue sample in the COSMIC database, it will no longer be considered here. Thus, by considering the tertiary structure, we significantly narrow the window of which residues to consider for potential driver mutations and can partition the protein into three segments: I) 464–599 and II) 600 and III) 601. Segment I is primarily associated with lung and colorectal cancer as shown in
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. Segment II represents the two most common mutations in BRAF, V600E and V600K. Overall, 95% of BRAF mutations occur on V600, with some studies showing that V600E occurs within 73% to 79% of patients while V600K occurs within 12% to 19% of patients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>]. Mutations at this position result in the oncogene being constitutively activated with increased kinase activity and have been found in a wide range of cancers such as metastatic melanoma
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>], ovarian serous carcinoma
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>] and hairy cell leukemia
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>]. Furthermore, recent inhibitors, such as Vemurafenib and GSK2118436 specifically target the V600E and V600E/K mutations (respectively), supporting the hypothesis that somatic clusters can provide pharmacological targets
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>]. Lastly, segment III is comprised of the much less common K601N mutation which has been observed in myeloma cases along with V600E. Since these patients share the more common BRAF mutations as well, they may also potentially benefit from BRAF inhibitors
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>].</p>
      <p>Further, as shown in Section ‘Results’ and described above, <italic>GraphPAC</italic> finds fewer clusters for a significant percentage of the structures analyzed. Overall, the reduction in total clusters identified can result from two sources: the removal of some residues because no tertiary data was available or the cluster is no longer significant when using the traveling salesman algorithm to account for 3D structure. The first case, which is already rare, will become increasingly more so as additional studies result in more complete and detailed structural information. For the second case, if a cluster is not found to be significant under <italic>GraphPAC</italic> when compared to NMC, a near or overlapping cluster is usually found (see Tables
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>a and
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>b). For BRAF specifically, under every type of graph insertion method (cheapest, nearest and farthest), every "probably damaging" or "possibly damaging" mutation (as classified by <italic>PolyPhen-2</italic>) was still identified in at least one significant cluster for the structure. For a complete analysis, see "Potential Driver Loss" in <italic>Additional file</italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>In this manuscript we provide an alternative method to utilize protein tertiary structure when identifying somatic mutation clusters. By employing a graph theoretic approach to restructuring the protein order, we identify both new clusters in proteins previously shown to have clustering as well as proteins that were not previously shown to have clustering. We have also provided several examples where we are able to identify clusters of mutations that may benefit from pharmacological treatment. Moreover, as <italic>GraphPAC</italic> uses the <italic>NMC</italic> algorithm to identify clusters rather than a fixed window size, we are able to detect clusters of varying lengths. Finally, the methodology is fast and robust with the overwhelming majority of structure/protein combinations taking under 10 minutes each to analyze on a consumer desktop.</p>
    <p>The <italic>GraphPAC</italic> algorithm, while presenting a viable alternative to the MDS restriction of <italic>iPAC</italic> and an improvement over NMC, nevertheless contains several limitations. First, while no longer bound to the MDS requirement of <italic>iPAC</italic>, there is no closed form solution to the shortest path problem and our algorithm must appeal to heuristic approximations. Second, to satisfy the uniformity assumption, the mutation status of all residues must be known ahead of time. With the growth of high-throughput sequencing however, this issue is temporary. Next, unequal rates of mutagenesis along with hypermutability of specific genomic regions may violate the assumption that every residue has a uniform probability of mutation. To help ensure that this assumption holds, we only consider single residue missense substitutions and have removed insertions and deletions from the analysis since they tend to be sequence dependent. Further, research has shown that CpG dinucleotides may have a mutational frequency ten times or higher compared to other dinucleotides
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>]. However, in the analyses presented in Sections ‘<italic>GraphPAC</italic> finds novel proteins compared to <italic>iPAC</italic> and <italic>NMC</italic>’, ‘<italic>GraphPAC</italic> identifies additional clusters compared to <italic>iPAC</italic> and <italic>NMC</italic>’, ‘<italic>GraphPAC</italic> finds fewer clusters compared to <italic>NMC</italic>’, only approximately 13% of the mutations used to identify clustering occurred in CpG sites. Relatedly, colorectal carcinomas
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>] contain more transition mutations while cigarette use results in more transversion mutations in lung carcinomas
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Still, when considering KRAS, the overwhelming majority of substitutions occur on residues 12, 13, and 61 for both colorectal and lung cancer, implying that while the mutational landscape may vary, it does not have a significant effect on mutation location and thus would not violate the uniformity assumption. Hence, while this analysis is influenced by a variety of factors, as are previous studies, it nevertheless appears that the primary cause of clustering is selection for a cancer phenotype.</p>
    <p>Several areas for future research are also directly evident. First, an approach that considers the protein directly in 3D space via simulation may be employed. However, such an approach would not be able to use the order statistic methodology to identify clustering and thus might not be as sensitive for small mutation counts. Moreover, while we only consider distance when finding the shortest path through the graph, future research can incorporate the physico-chemical properties of the specific residues or domains by appropriately increasing or decreasing edge length. The potential additive effect of multiple cancer mutations in the same protein, as discussed in the case of EGFR by Hashimoto <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>], can also be incorporated via additional refinement of the edge weights. Additional research is required in this area in order to incorporate these improvements.</p>
    <p>Overall however, <italic>GraphPAC</italic> utilizes protein tertiary structure via a graph theoretic approach in identifying mutational clustering. We show that this method identifies new clusters that are otherwise missed and that in some cases, pharmaceutical targets for mutations in these clusters have already been found and therapies created. Specifically, Erlotinib and Getfinib are used to target mutations in EGFR significant clusters (see Section ‘<italic>GraphPAC</italic> finds novel proteins compared to <italic>iPAC</italic> and <italic>NMC</italic>’) while Vemurafenib is used to target mutations that occur within BRAF significant clusters (see Section ‘<italic>GraphPAC</italic> finds fewer clusters compared to <italic>NMC</italic>’). This helps confirm the hypothesis that mutational clustering may be indicative of driver mutations and as new protein structures become available, <italic>GraphPAC</italic> can provide a rapid methodology to identify such potential mutations.</p>

As the substitution of one amino acid in the structure would not have a significant impact on the spatial structure of the protein, and residue 61 is a highly mutated position, the residue was kept in the analysis. As a result, amino acids 1–167 are used.</p>
