        <title>Background</title>
        <p>The vitamins are important cofactors in various enzymatic-reactions. In past, many inhibitors have been designed against vitamin binding pockets in order to inhibit vitamin-protein interactions. Thus, it is important to identify vitamin interacting residues in a protein. It is possible to detect vitamin-binding pockets on a protein, if its tertiary structure is known. Unfortunately tertiary structures of limited proteins are available. Therefore, it is important to develop <italic>in</italic>-<italic>silico</italic> models for predicting vitamin interacting residues in protein from its primary structure.</p>

        <title>Results</title>
        <p>In this study, first we compared protein-interacting residues of vitamins with other ligands using Two Sample Logo (TSL). It was observed that ATP, GTP, NAD, FAD and mannose preferred {G,R,K,S,H}, {G,K,T,S,D,N}, {T,G,Y}, {G,Y,W} and {Y,D,W,N,E} residues respectively, whereas vitamins preferred {Y,F,S,W,T,G,H} residues for the interaction with proteins. Furthermore, compositional information of preferred and non-preferred residues along with patterns-specificity was also observed within different vitamin-classes. Vitamins A, B and B6 preferred {F,I,W,Y,L,V}, {S,Y,G,T,H,W,N,E} and {S,T,G,H,Y,N} interacting residues respectively. It suggested that protein-binding patterns of vitamins are different from other ligands, and motivated us to develop separate predictor for vitamins and their sub-classes. The four different prediction modules, (i) vitamin interacting residues (VIRs), (ii) vitamin-A interacting residues (VAIRs), (iii) vitamin-B interacting residues (VBIRs) and (iv) pyridoxal-5-phosphate (vitamin B6) interacting residues (PLPIRs) have been developed. We applied various classifiers of SVM, BayesNet, NaiveBayes, ComplementNaiveBayes, NaiveBayesMultinomial, RandomForest and IBk etc., as machine learning techniques, using binary and Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) features of protein sequences. Finally, we selected best performing SVM modules and obtained highest MCC of 0.53, 0.48, 0.61, 0.81 for VIRs, VAIRs, VBIRs, PLPIRs respectively, using PSSM-based evolutionary information. All the modules developed in this study have been trained and tested on non-redundant datasets and evaluated using five-fold cross-validation technique. The performances were also evaluated on the balanced and different independent datasets.</p>

    <title>Background</title>
    <p>A protein individually utilizes only a limited range of functionality present in its natural amino acid side chains, and the catalytic activity of many enzymes requires the involvement of a small-molecule that acts as a co-factor. These are required in almost all important metabolic pathways because they are specialized in certain types of reaction. One particular cofactor can be involved in several pathways and, conversely, several cofactors can be required in one particular pathway
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Many vitamins have diverse biochemical functions but they are primarily known to assist enzyme-substrate reactions by playing the role of an enzyme cofactor
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Some vitamins have hormone-like function as regulators of mineral metabolism (e.g. vitamin D), or regulators of cell and tissue growth and differentiation (e.g. some forms of vitamin A). The function of vitamin D as anti-infectious and anti-inflammatory is well-established
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and other functions as antioxidants (e.g. vitamin E and sometimes vitamin C). The majority of vitamins (e.g. B complex vitamins) function as precursors of enzyme cofactor that helps enzyme in their work as catalysts in metabolism
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p>
    <p>As most vitamin biosynthetic pathway enzymes are not present in mammals and present in many of the pathogens
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], these enzymes have become attractive drug targets in several disease including tuberculosis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and malaria
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Several investigators have targeted Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) for different diseases like African trypanosomiasis, <italic>Pneumocystis carinii</italic> pneumonia, ischemia, autoimmune diseases and hyperplasia
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Nonetheless, many groups are targeting Serine hydroxyl-methyltransferase (SHMT) as antitumor target knowing that enhanced levels of SHMT activity have been found in rapidly proliferating tumor cells
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A constitutive ODC activity observed in cancer cells, where its uncontrolled expression confers a cancer phenotype to the cells so ODC has been targeted in antitumor drugs
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In past, several studies have been done to identify the cofactor binding cleft and interacting residues in various enzymes. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes like 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine decarboxylase (DDC)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], Aminobutyrate aminotransferase
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], ODC and SHMT etc. have been investigated in various studies for identification of PLP and substrate interacting residues. These studies helped them to investigate the underlying mechanism and develop strategies for inhibitor designing. Similarly enzymes involved in folate (Vit-B9) metabolism such as Dihydropteroate synthase
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], Dihydrofolate synthase
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and thiamin (Vit-B1) pathway
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] like Pyruvate dehydrogenase
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and Oxoglutarate dehydrogenase
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] have also been taken as drug targets. In addition, binding of PLP also inhibits the activity of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Therefore, computational tool for the prediction of PLP and other vitamin-interacting site is highly desirable.</p>
    <p>The advancement of genome sequencing produces huge amount of sequence data but reliable <italic>in</italic><italic>silico</italic> annotation of these sequences still remains a challenge. There are several prediction tools available for the functional annotation of proteins. Broadly, the existing computational method can be divided in two categories; (i) protein level prediction, where function of whole protein is predicted
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and (ii) residue level prediction where function of each residue in a protein is predicted
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The protein level prediction provides overall function of protein whereas residue level predictions are advancement over protein level and provides the information of functional residues. The residue level predictions mainly deal with prediction of interaction with other proteins, DNA, RNA and ligands. There are various methods to predict different interacting residues from the structure of protein but the major challenge is to predict interacting residues when only protein sequence is known. Several prediction methods have been developed for carbohydrates
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], lipids
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], DNA
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and RNA
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] interacting residues in protein sequence. Some methods have been developed for specific ligands such as ATP
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], GTP
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], NAD
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], FAD
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and mannose
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p>
    <p>In this study, preliminary investigations revealed differential binding patterns of vitamins and other small-molecules. These differential patterns suggested that each ligand has specific residual preference for their binding with protein. Therefore, it becomes important to develop vitamin-specific interacting residue prediction methods. In this study, we developed different models for the sequence-based prediction of vitamin-interacting residues (VIRs), vitamin-A interacting residues (VAIRs), vitamin-B interacting residues (VBIRs) and PLP-interacting residues (PLPIRs). We utilized various classifiers and finally selected Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for developing the prediction models. SVM is a very powerful machine learning technique, which has been used for developing various bioinformatics methods in the past
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. It has been shown that the evolutionary information provided more information
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] than protein sequence, therefore we applied evolutionary information in the form of Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) profile for developing a prediction method. This vitamin binding site prediction will be very useful for the study of enzyme activity and further advancement of drug development technologies.</p>

      <title>Analysis of protein-binding patterns of various ligands</title>
      <p>It is important to analyze protein-binding patterns of different ligands in order to understand binding specificity of each ligand. Previously published datasets of different ligand-binding patterns for example ATP, GTP, NAD, FAD and mannose, were used to look at the preference of interacting residues. We analyzed the ligand-binding patterns for ATP (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1), GTP (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S2), NAD (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S3), FAD (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S4) and mannose (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S5) with the help of Two Sample Logo (TSL) (See all Figures in Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). It was observed that each ligand preferentially interacted with different residues of proteins. The ATP, GTP, NAD, FAD and mannose preferred the residues {Gly, Arg, Lys, Ser, His}, {Gly, Lys, Thr, Ser, Asp, Asn}, {Thr, Gly, Tyr}, {Gly, Tyr, Trp} and {Tyr, Asp, Trp, Asn, Glu}, respectively. The non-preferred residues were {Leu, Ala, Pro, Glu, Val}, {Leu, Glu, Ile, Met, Val}, {Leu, Glu, Ala, Lys}, {Glu, Asp, Lys, Ala, Pro} and {Leu, Val, Ile} for the ATP, GTP, NAD, FAD and mannose ligands respectively. We further analyzed and observed that significant differences were also present in the neighboring residues surrounding these preferred and non-preferred sets. This suggests the existence of different binding pockets for each small molecule ligand in the proteins. In order to predict these potentially differing binding pockets, there should be ligand specific binding site tools.</p>

      <title>Analysis of different protein-interacting residues of different vitamin classes</title>
      <p>After analysis of various ligand-protein interactions, we compared vitamins-interacting patterns with other ligands and found that significant differences were present. The Tyr, Phe, Ser, Trp, Thr, Gly and His are preferred as VIRs whereas Glu, Ala, Pro, Leu, Lys, Gln, Val and Asp are non-preferred. We analyzed amino acid compositions of the vitamin binding protein residues grouped by the sub-class to which the binding protein belonged: VIRs, VAIRs, VBIRs and PLPIRs (Figure 
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The interacting site of Vitamin A, Vitamin B and PLP preferred {Phe, Ile, Trp, Tyr, Leu, Val}, {Ser, Tyr, Gly, Thr, His, Trp, Asn, Glu} and {Ser, Thr, Gly, His, Tyr, Asn} whereas the non-preferred residues were {Glu, Pro, Asp, Asn, Ser, Arg, Gln}, {Leu, Glu, Ala, Pro, Val, Ile, Lys} and {Leu, Glu, Ala, Pro, Val, Ile, Ala} respectively. This implies that differences do exist at the protein-vitamin interaction sites even within vitamins sub-classes.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>In this study, we initially developed a model for the prediction of vitamin-interacting residues and then further classified VIRs into vitamin A, vitamin B and pyridoxal-5-phosphate (vitamin B6; PLP) interacting residues. Four different types of prediction methods were developed, one for each of the interacting residues: VIRs, VAIRs, VBIRs and PLPIRs. All the models developed in this study were evaluated using five-fold cross validation technique. In all cases, we used 10 times more negative instances than positive instances.</p>
      <sec>
        <title>Prediction of vitamin-interacting residues (VIRs)</title>
        <p>Here we developed the comprehensive prediction method for all VIRs. By generating sliding patterns and creating Two Sample Logo, we found that Phe, Gly, His, Ser, Thr, Trp and Tyr were more abundant in VIRs as compared to non-VIRs (See Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S6). These patterns were converted into binary patterns and different kernels/parameters of SVM were employed to optimize the discrimination power between VIR and non-VIR patterns. We achieved 68.57% sensitivity, 64.88% specificity, 65.22% accuracy and 0.20 MCC. Preferences for neighboring amino acids between VIRs and non-VIRs patterns were also observed in the TSL (See Additional file:
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> Figure S6). Thereafter, evolutionary information obtained from PSI-BLAST was used for the discrimination between VIRs and non-VIRs. Applying different machine learning algorithms of WEKA revealed that IBk method achieved maximum 50.70% sensitivity, 96.91% specificity, 92.71% accuracy and 0.52 MCC. SVM achieved highest 0.53 MCC with 52.19% sensitivity, 96.79% specificity and 92.73% accuracy. At the −0.8 thresholds level SVM achieved 78.52% sensitivity, 78.61% specificity, 78.60% accuracy and 0.37 MCC. Performances of all applied classifiers are provided in Table 
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. As shown in Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) graph, binary (SVM), PSSM (IBk) and PSSM (SVM) achieved 0.74, 0.74 and 0.87 Area under curve (AUC) values, respectively (Figure 
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The performance increased significantly when PSSM was used as input instead of the binary patterns approach.</p>

        <title>Prediction of vitamin A interacting residues (VAIRs)</title>
        <p>We also developed prediction method for the VAIRs. The TSL of sliding patterns showed that Phe, Ile, Leu, Val and Trp were more abundant in VAIRs than in non-VAIRs (See Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S7). These patterns were converted into the binary profile of patterns in order to develop the SVM-based prediction model. This model achieved 61.92% sensitivity, 65.09% specificity, 64.80% accuracy and 0.16 MCC. The IBk based prediction model of PSSM achieved maximum 44.05% sensitivity, 94.65% specificity, 90.05% accuracy and 0.39 MCC. SVM based PSSM approach achieved highest MCC of 0.48 with 42.75% sensitivity, 97.51% specificity and 92.54% accuracy. At the −0.8 thresholds level SVM achieved balanced performance of 72.70% sensitivity, 76.89% specificity, 76.51% accuracy and 0.32 MCC. Table 
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> shows performances of all applied classifiers. As shown in ROC graph, binary (SVM), PSSM (IBk) and PSSM (SVM) achieved 0.70, 0.70 and 0.83 AUC values, respectively (Figure 
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The PSSM based approach enhanced the prediction performance with SVM.</p>

        <title>Prediction of vitamin B interacting residues (VBIRs)</title>
        <p>The TSL analysis of VBIRs and non-VBIRs showed that Gly, His, Asn, Ser, Thr, Trp and Tyr were more abundant in VBIRs (See Additional file:
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> Figure S8). The SVM-based prediction model was developed using binary patterns and achieved 73.22% sensitivity, 67.00% specificity, 67.57% accuracy and 0.24 MCC. The IBk based prediction model of PSSM achieved maximum 56.74% sensitivity, 98.04% specificity, 94.28% accuracy and 0.62 MCC. SVM based PSSM approach achieved highest 0.61 MCC with 55.57% sensitivity, 98.04% specificity and 94.18% accuracy. At the −0.8 thresholds level SVM achieved 81.39% sensitivity, 81.77% specificity, 81.73% accuracy and 0.43 MCC. Performances of all applied classifiers are provided in Table 
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>. As shown in ROC graph, binary (SVM), PSSM (IBk) and PSSM (SVM) achieved 0.78, 0.77 and 0.90 AUC values, respectively (Figure 
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The overall performance increased by PSSM profiles based model, in compare to binary patterns based approaches.</p>

The binary patterns (17-length windows) based prediction model achieved 77.02% sensitivity, 83.17% specificity, 82.62% accuracy and 0.42 MCC. The IBk based PSSM approach achieved 76.10% sensitivity, 98.80% specificity, 96.74% accuracy and 0.79 MCC whereas SVM based achieved highest 0.81 MCC with 79.76% sensitivity, 98.62% specificity, 96.91% accuracy. At the −0.7 thresholds level SVM achieved 79.76% sensitivity, 98.62% specificity, 96.91% accuracy and 0.81 MCC. As shown in ROC graph, binary (SVM), PSSM (IBk) and PSSM (SVM) achieved 0.88, 0.87 and 0.97 AUC values, respectively (Figure

      <title>Performance on the independent datasets</title>
      <p>Four different independent datasets, V-IND-46, VA-IND-15, VB-IND-27 and PLP-IND-16, containing 46, 15, 27 and 16 protein sequences and utilized for the evaluation of VIRs, VAIRs, VBIRs and PLPIRs prediction methods, were used. We used SVM-based binary approach, calculated performances at already optimized threshold level (by 5-fold cross validation of main-dataset) and achieved highest 0.19, 0.23, 0.20 and 0.30 MCC for the prediction of VIRs, VAIRs, VBIRs and PLPIRs respectively (See Additional file

      <title>Surface accessibility based prediction</title>
      <p>Most of binding residues reside inside the surface pockets and predicting these pockets is therefore important. For these predictions, it is required to firstly predict the surface accessibility (SA) of each residue from the protein sequence. Therefore, we used SARpred method
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] for the prediction of surface accessibility of all residues. On the basis of these surface accessibility values, we tried to develop SVM-based models but as shown in the Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S2 the performances were very poor on the realistic dataset. On the balanced dataset, SA-based approach achieved 0.15, 0.08, 0.22 and 0.30 MCC for the prediction of VIRs, VAIRs, VBIRs and PLPIRs respectively. The major limitation of this approach was that surface accessibility feature itself was predicted from the protein sequences. The results were showing that only PLP-interacting residues could be predicted (MCC 0.30) with surface accessibility while other predictors performed poorly (See Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S2). The performance of PLPIRs predictor was better than the performance from this study. This may be because of the presence of more than one ligand in the other predictors (VIR, VAIR, VBIR). There may be chances that binding pockets were very different for each ligand and therefore difficult to model. Sometime, it is better to combine more than two features, in order to achieve good prediction results. In-spite of a combined PSSM-surface accessibility approach, we were unable to achieve any improvement in performance measures over the single PSSM-based approach for both the realistic and balanced datasets (See Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S2). These results suggest that PSSM-based individual approach performances were as good as combined approach with both PSSM and surface accessibility features.</p>

      <title>Quality of PSSM profiles</title>
      <p>The number of homology sequences can affect the quality of PSSM profiles; therefore it is important to check the quality of PSSM profiles. Earlier this type of analysis has been done for the prediction of DNA-binding proteins in the DNAbinder method
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The number of homology sequences depends on total number of the protein sequences in the database. We used PSI-BLAST program for the default parameters with 3 iterations and checked the prediction performance on the different independent datasets. The independent datasets of VIRs, VAIRs, VBIRs and PLPIRs are V-IND-46, VA-IND-15, VB-IND-27 and PLP-IND-16 and containing 46, 15, 27, and 16 protein sequences respectively. The prediction performances (at default threshold level) of different independent datasets are shown in the Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S3. As the total numbers of homology sequences were different for each query sequence; by default it varied from the 0–500 sequences. On the basis of total PSI-BLAST hits, we divided each dataset into five different categories (overall 0–500, 0–10, 11–100, 101–400 and 401–500). As mentioned in the Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S3, it was observed that performances increased with the increment of number of homolog sequences. Prediction performances were poor for the 0–10 and 11–100 ranges of query sequences in all four cases whereas average for the 101–400 range and good for the 401–500 homolog sequences.</p>
      <p>These results suggested that the quality of PSSM profiles depends on the number of homolog sequences. In most of cases, the major fraction of sequences ranged between 401–500 (PSI-BLAST hit range). The overall performances of simple binary-based approach (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S1) were higher than the PSSM-based prediction that had range values between 0–10 (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S3).</p>

      <title>Datasets</title>
      <p>In this study, we collected data from SuperSite documentation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and extracted 1061 PDB IDs of protein having contact with vitamins in PDB. We downloaded the sequence of all chains of these PDB Ids from Protein Data Bank
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. In next step, we used these PDB IDs in Ligand Protein Contact (LPC) web-server
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] and get total 2720 chains that interact with vitamins with their corresponding interacting residues and its position. We used a cut-off of 5.0 Å to define the vitamin interacting residues. A residue was considered to be vitamin-interacting if the closest distance between atoms of the protein and the partner vitamin was within the cut-off (5 Å). The 25% non-redundant dataset of protein chains was created by using BLASTCLUST and finally retrieved a total 187 interacting chains with a total 3004 vitamin-interacting residues (VIRs) and remaining all residues are non-vitamin-interacting residues (non-VIRs). This step was repeated for the dataset development of vitamin A, vitamin B and PLP (vitamin B6-derived) interacting residue prediction and retrieved 538, 2207 and 1092 interacting residues in 31, 141 and 71 chains respectively. The interacting and non-interacting residues were used as positive and negative instances respectively. The number of non-interacting residues was very large than interacting residues so we have randomly picked up 10 times more non-interacting than interacting residues in order to create realistic dataset. The balanced datasets of equal positive and negative were also created, where equal numbers of random negative instances was taken from the total negative window patterns.</p>
      <p>We created four different independent datasets: V-IND-46, VA-IND-15, VB-IND-27 and PLP-IND-16 of the 46, 15, 27 and 16 protein sequences for the prediction of VIRs, VAIRs, VBIRs and PLPIRs respectively. All these datasets were 25% non-redundant and all sequences of these independent datasets were less than 25% similar than sequences of main datasets.</p>

      <title>Window patterns and size</title>
      <p>We generated sliding (overlapping) patterns of 17-residue size, for each interacting chain sequence. In past, several studies have adopted this strategy for the interacting residue tools development
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. If the central residue of pattern was interacting, then we classified the pattern as interacting or positive pattern; otherwise it was termed as non-interacting or negative pattern. To generate the pattern corresponding to the terminal residues in a protein sequence, we have added (L-1)/2 dummy residue "X" at both terminals of protein (where L is the length of pattern). Here the length of pattern is 17 so we have added 8 "X" before N-terminal and 8 "X" after C-terminal, in order to create equal number of patterns from sequence length.</p>

      <title>Binary profile of patterns</title>
      <p>These positive and negative patterns were converted into the binary patterns and all amino acids represented by a vector of 21 dimensions (e.g. Ala by 1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0; Cys by 0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0), which contained 20 standard amino acids and one dummy amino acid “X”. We used these profiles as an input data of various machine-learning algorithms.</p>

      <title>Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM)</title>
      <p>We performed PSI-BLAST (position-specific iterative BLAST) search (default parameter) against the non-redundant (NR) database available at Swiss-Prot
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. After three iterations, PSI-BLAST generated the PSSM profiles with the highest score from multiple alignments of the high-scoring hits by calculating the position-specific scores for each position in the alignments. The PSSM profile contains the occurrence probability of all amino acids at each position along with insertion/deletion and provides the evolutionary information for all amino acids. The final PSSM was normalized using a sigmoid function.</p>

      <title>Surface accessibility</title>
      <p>We calculated surface accessibility value for each residue of the all sequences using SARpred method

We used these 17 input features for the SVM-based prediction of VIRs, VAIRs, VBIRs and PLPIRs. In the hybrid approach with PSSM, we combined these 17 input features with the PSSM features.</p>

      <p>In this study, a highly successful machine learning technique termed as a <italic>Support Vector Machine</italic> (SVM) was used. SVM is a machine-learning tool and based on the structural risk minimization principle of statistics learning theory. SVMs are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. The user can choose and optimize number of parameters and kernels (e.g. Linear, polynomial, radial basis function and sigmoidal) or any user-defined kernel. In this study, we implemented SVM<sup>light</sup> Version 6.02 package
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] of SVM and machine learning was carried out using three different (linear, polynomial and radial basis function) kernels. SVM takes a set of fixed length input features, along with their output, which is used for training of model. After training, learned model can be used for prediction of unknown examples

The protein sequences/patterns of positive and negative instances were randomly divided into five parts. Each of these five sets consists of one-fifth of positive and one-fifth of negative instances.

      <p>We rescaled the SVM scores with maximum 1.5 and minimum −1.5, where more than 1.5 and less than −1.5 both scores were used as 1.5 and −1.5 respectively. The probability score varies from 0–9 for each residue of protein sequence. The probability scores ranges between 0–4 and 5–9 predicted as non-interacting and interacting residues respectively at default 0.0 thresholds.</p>
      <p>The five fold cross-validation technique created five test sets and calculated performance for each test set. The final performance of prediction model is an average performance of these five test sets. In this average performance, we also calculated standard error of the performance of these five test set. MCC is considered to the most robust parameters for the evaluation of any prediction method
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. The MCC value ranges between +1 to −1. The MCC value of 1 corresponds to a perfect prediction, whereas 0 corresponds to a completely random prediction. The −1 MCC value indicates total disagreement between prediction and actual examples. The evaluation parameters of SVM performances are threshold-dependent and require parameters/kernels optimization for the better results. The complete optimization of all parameters is key step in SVM based machine learning. We manually optimized all parameters and selected the highly performed prediction models for different tasks. In order to have a threshold independent evaluation of our method, we also created ROC and calculated AUC value for the threshold independent evaluation using SPSS statistical package.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>The experimental determination of vitamin binding sites is very difficult task because of their complex chemical nature, and the fact that they are often made in very small amounts, making detection of the enzyme activities and intermediates difficult
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. So there is a need to develop alternate technique, such as computational techniques for predicting vitamin-binding sites in a protein. The comparative analysis of different ligands with VIR (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S6) such as ATP (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1), GTP (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S2), NAD (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S3), FAD (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S4) and mannose (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S5) revealed that each ligand has different protein-binding patterns (See all Figures in Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Thus, it is important to develop a separate vitamin-interacting residues prediction tool.</p>
    <p>We have used available structural information (knowledge-based) for the prediction model development using different machine learning algorithms. The structural information of protein-vitamin complexes extracted from SuperSite
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. We found total 1061 protein-vitamin complexes, in which 181 and 843 complexes proteins are bind with vitamin A and B respectively. Out of these total 843 complexes of vitamin B binding complexes, 553 are bind to vitamin B(6)-derived pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) binding protein. The structural availability of vitamin C, D, E and K binding protein complexes are very low in PDB. Thus, we have developed four different methods for the prediction of VIRs, VAIRs, VBIRs and PLPIRs. We identified interacting and non-interacting residues using Ligand Protein Contact (LPC) web server
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. The interacting residues analysis suggested that Phe, Gly, His, Ser, Thr, Trp and Tyr amino acids are preferred in the vitamin binding pockets of Vitamin Binding Proteins (VBPs) (Figures 
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The preference of interacting and neighboring residues is vitamin class-specific (See Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S6-S9). In the past, it has been shown in some studies that multiple sequence alignment based evolutionary information provides more comprehensive detail about the protein instead of single sequence
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. Thus, all sequences of datasets were created into PSSM profiles and used for the prediction tool development. The comparative analysis between vitamin A and B interacting sites showed that Phe, Ile, Leu, Val and Trp are abundant in VAIRs whereas Asp, Glu, Gly, His, Lys, Asn. Arg, Ser and Thr are abundant in VBIRs (Figure 
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, See Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S7-S8). The vitamin B(6)-derived pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is the cofactor of enzymes catalyzing a large variety of chemical reactions (more than 140 enzymes are PLP-dependent) mainly involved in amino acid metabolism
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. According to the Enzyme Commission, about 4% of enzyme-catalyzed reactions are PLP-dependent (EC;
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/">http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/</ext-link>). Therefore, it was very important to develop a separate prediction model for the PLPIRs in protein sequence. The PSSM based approach achieved maximum performance for PLPIRs because of separate model for a single PLP molecule. The VIRs, VAIRs and VBIRs modules performed relatively low because each class comprises more than one molecule. It means the overall prediction performance of VIRs is an approximately combined performance of all vitamins.</p>
    <p>The performances of all the used classifiers are also provided in the Tables 
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>,
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>,
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>, and
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>. It was observed that PSSM feature based SVM classifier performed better in all cases, in term of balancing between sensitivity and specificity. The threshold-independent performance of SVM is better than IBk for all modules (Figures 
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>,
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>,
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In the 5-fold cross validation, we got total five prediction performances corresponding to five test sets and computed average performance and standard error (SE) from these 5 performances. In most of cases, we found low value of SE, which is variation in the performance over five sets (it is not performance of variation on individual protein/chain). As patterns were divided randomly in five sets so it is expected that performance in each set will be nearly same. In other words, low SE values show that distribution of patterns in sets is not biased. Moreover, SE is not affected by similarity between patterns or protein chains, as this SE only measures biasness in distribution of patterns in five sets.</p>
    <p>The prediction performances on the different independent datasets show that these modules can predict interacting residues of all vitamin classes with reasonably good accuracy (Table 
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>). The quality of PSSM profiles were also investigated and found that protein sequences in our dataset have fairly high number of hits. Furthermore we also found PSSM approach based prediction performances increase with the increasing number of PSI-BLAST hits of the query sequence. As discussed, vitamins are crucial for the activation of many enzymes and crystal structures of many VBPs are unsolved. Furthermore, many vitamin-dependent enzymes have been used as a potential drug targets, thus residue level study of vitamin-interacting and non-interacting sites will be use for the further drug discovery processes.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>In order to assist the biologists in assigning the vitamin-interacting residues of VBPs, a systematic attempt has been made for predicting the vitamin-binding sites (VIRs, VAIRs, VBIRs and PLPIRs) from the amino acid sequence of VBPs. This study demonstrates that PSSM evolutionary information can be use to predict vitamin-binding sites in a protein sequence.</p>
