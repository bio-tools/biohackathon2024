    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>Plasmids are among the most important components of mobile genetic elements. Recently, experimental and computational approaches (<xref rid="btaa103-B2" ref-type="bibr">Fang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="btaa103-B6" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Marchesi, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="btaa103-B7" ref-type="bibr">Krawczyk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="btaa103-B15" ref-type="bibr">Zhou and Xu, 2010</xref>) have been developed to enrich plasmid DNA from the metagenome, leading to the discovery of a large number of novel plasmids. Identifying genes, particularly novel genes, in plasmid metagenomic data is a fundamental method for elucidating the mechanisms by which plasmids regulate the microbial community, especially the spread of resistance genes.</p>
    <p>However, gene prediction in plasmid metagenomic data may be much more difficult than that in untargeted metagenomic data, in which chromosome-derived DNA is dominant. Generally, sequence assembly facilitates gene prediction because fewer genes are cut off in longer fragments. Unfortunately, sequence assembly for plasmid metagenomic short reads is still a difficult task owing to the mobile nature of plasmids, such as the presence of repetitive elements (<xref rid="btaa103-B11" ref-type="bibr">Rozov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Although some tools have been designed to address the assembly challenge caused by repetitive regions (<xref rid="btaa103-B5" ref-type="bibr">Ji <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="btaa103-B13" ref-type="bibr">Shi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), other unique genomic patterns of plasmids, like the existence of shared genes and the mosaic structure, may prevent the usage of state-of-the-art assembly tools. Research has shown that the sensitivity of finding resistance genes on assembled contigs is lower than that on short reads directly, which may be caused by misassembly (<xref rid="btaa103-B1" ref-type="bibr">Clausen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Therefore, identifying genes in metagenomic short reads may be a better choice for plasmid studies than assembled contigs. Since a short read often contains at least one functional domain of a gene, even if the gene is cut-off in the fragment, this approach is widely used in metagenomic studies (<xref rid="btaa103-B12" ref-type="bibr">Sharpton, 2014</xref>). However, traditional gene prediction tools for metagenomic short reads are primarily constructed using data from bacterial chromosomes. It has been shown that plasmids often contain different sequence signatures with chromosomes (<xref rid="btaa103-B7" ref-type="bibr">Krawczyk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Therefore, although traditional tools present good results for bacterial chromosomes, they may not adapt to plasmid metagenomic short reads.</p>
    <p>In this work, we present PlasGUN, the first tool for gene prediction in plasmid metagenomic short reads, which is constructed over a large-scale plasmid dataset. Using deep learning, PlasGUN first extracts all candidate ORFs (Open Reading Frame) from the input short reads and then judges each ORF as a coding or non-coding ORF. The tool demonstrates high performance when tested on both benchmark datasets of artificial short reads and real plasmid metagenomic data.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec>
    <title>2 Materials and methods</title>
    <p>Because we lack experimental metagenomic data with precise gene annotation, constructing a benchmark dataset of artificial short reads is the primary approach for developing a gene prediction tool (<xref rid="btaa103-B8" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Herein we downloaded 4395 complete genomes of prokaryotic plasmids from the RefSeq database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/</ext-link>release/plasmid/). The accession list of the genomes is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> S1. To test whether PlasGUN could identify genes in novel genomes, which is an important task for a metagenomic study, we used genomes released before 2013 to build the training set and the rest to build the test set. We then extracted DNA fragments from all genomes to construct an artificial short-read dataset. The lengths of the fragments were between 100 and 900 bp, which encompasses the lengths of different shotgun sequencing technologies. All candidate ORFs (both complete and partial) longer than 60 bp were extracted from the six phases of each DNA fragment, and all ORFs were labelled as coding or non-coding according to the RefSeq annotation.</p>
    <p>Considering that the plasmid sequence often contains mixed patterns from its wide range of hosts, we used the ‘one-hot’ encoding form as a mathematical model to characterize an ORF. Unlike the global statistics used by previous tools, such encoding form provided a more detail characterization for the sequence with mixed patterns. We further designed miCNN (multiple input Convolutional Neural Network) to detect the functional domain and sequence pattern from the ORF represented by the ‘one-hot’ encoding form through the convolution operation. For each input ORF, miCNN outputs a likelihood score (0–1) reflecting whether the ORF is a coding ORF. We trained two miCNNs for sequences between 100–400 bp (GroupS) and 401–900 bp (GoupL), respectively. More details about the dataset construction and the structure of the miCNN are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> S2.</p>

    <title>3 Results and discussion</title>
    <p>Against the test set with gene annotation, PlasGUN was evaluated and achieved AUCs (Area Under Curve) of 98.72% and 98.81% for GroupS and GroupL, respectively, indicating that PlasGUN can present high performance. We further compared the prediction of PlasGUN with that of Prodigal (<xref rid="btaa103-B4" ref-type="bibr">Hyatt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), MetaGUN (<xref rid="btaa103-B8" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), MetaGeneMark (<xref rid="btaa103-B16" ref-type="bibr">Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), FragGeneScan (<xref rid="btaa103-B10" ref-type="bibr">Rho <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), MetaGeneAnnotator (<xref rid="btaa103-B9" ref-type="bibr">Noguchi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) and Orphelia (<xref rid="btaa103-B3" ref-type="bibr">Hoff <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The evaluation criteria were defined as sensitivity <italic>Sn</italic>=<italic>TP</italic>/(<italic>TP</italic>+<italic>FN</italic>) and specificity <italic>Sp</italic>=<italic>TP</italic>/(<italic>TP</italic>+<italic>FP</italic>). For PlasGUN, an ORF with a score higher than a given threshold would be regarded as coding ORF. To make the comparison convincing, we adjusted the threshold to allow PlasGUN to achieve the same <italic>Sp</italic> as that of the comparative tools. Under the same <italic>Sp</italic>, we compared the <italic>Sn</italic> of the comparative tools (shown as <italic>SnC</italic> in <xref rid="btaa103-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) with the <italic>Sn</italic> of PlasGUN (shown as <italic>SnP</italic> in <xref rid="btaa103-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Notably, a large percentage of genes (41.09%) from the complete genomes of the dataset were labelled ‘hypothetical’ or ‘putative’ or lacked exact product annotation, which were primarily annotated by the computational pipeline, and had unknown functions. Although these genes are less convincing to serve as benchmarks, gene annotation in complete genomes is less challenging than that in metagenomic genomes and is generally reliable because the metagenomic genomes contain too many incomplete genes, leading to less information used for gene prediction (<xref rid="btaa103-B8" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Since identifying novel genes is an important goal in metagenomic studies, it was necessary to determine the performance of the gene prediction tools on sequences with genes of uncertain function because these sequences might contain a large number of novel genes. Thus, we compared sequences without genes of uncertain function and sequences with genes of uncertain function separately. The results are shown in <xref rid="btaa103-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Under the same <italic>Sp</italic>, PlasGUN consistently achieved a higher <italic>Sn</italic> than other gene prediction tools, and this advantage was more remarkable in GroupS than in GroupL. Considering that the short reads obtained from the most widely used sequencing technologies, such as Illumina, often contain only hundreds of bases, the improved performance of PlasGUN for short fragments makes this tool highly powerful to analyse plasmid metagenomic short reads. Additionally, we found that compared with other prediction tools, PlasGUN had an obvious advantage when tested on sequences with genes of uncertain function. Among the comparative tools, Prodigal was the best performing software, and the <italic>Sn</italic> of PlasGUN was 5.40% and 6.65% higher than that of Prodigal on sequences without genes of uncertain function and sequences with genes of uncertain function in GroupS, respectively. This showed that PlasGUN was more competent in finding novel genes. In the released version of the PlasGUN tool, users can adjust the threshold according to their own requirements. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> S2, we evaluated the performance of PlasGUN under different thresholds. By default, the threshold with the highest harmonic mean <italic>Hm</italic>=(2×<italic>Sn</italic>×<italic>Sp</italic>)/(<italic>Sn</italic>+<italic>Sp</italic>) will be selected.</p>

    <p>In addition, we used real plasmid metagenomic short reads from a wastewater treatment plant sample (<xref rid="btaa103-B14" ref-type="bibr">Szczepanowski <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) to evaluate the reliability of each tool. PlasGUN was run under default settings. All predictions of each tool were searched both against the RefSeq plasmid protein database using PSI-BLAST, a homology search strategy that is more sensitive for novel genes with low similarity to the database, and against the Conserved Domain Database using DELTA-BLAST, a sensitive protein search strategy for novel genes. PlasGUN achieved the highest proportion of predictions that contained BLAST hits, indicating that the predictions of PlasGUN were more reliable and might contain more novel genes than other prediction tools. We also evaluated related tools using plasmid artificial short reads with 5% contamination of chromosome-derived short reads, and PlasGUN was still the best performing tool.
