      <p>DNA N6-methyladenine (6mA) is a dominant DNA modification form and involved in many biological functions. The accurate genome-wide identification of 6mA sites may increase understanding of its biological functions. Experimental methods for 6mA detection in eukaryotes genome are laborious and expensive. Therefore, it is necessary to develop computational methods to identify 6mA sites on a genomic scale, especially for plant genomes. Based on this consideration, the study aims to develop a machine learning-based method of predicting 6mA sites in the rice genome. We initially used mono-nucleotide binary encoding to formulate positive and negative samples. Subsequently, the machine learning algorithm named Random Forest was utilized to perform the classification for identifying 6mA sites. Our proposed method could produce an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.964 with an overall accuracy of 0.917, as indicated by the fivefold cross-validation test. Furthermore, an independent dataset was established to assess the generalization ability of our method. Finally, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.981 was obtained, suggesting that the proposed method had good performance of predicting 6mA sites in the rice genome. For the convenience of retrieving 6mA sites, on the basis of the computational method, we built a freely accessible web server named iDNA6mA-Rice at <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://lin-group.cn/server/iDNA6mA-Rice">http://lin-group.cn/server/iDNA6mA-Rice</uri>.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Methylated bases, such as N4-methylcytosine (4mC), N6-methyladenine (6mA), and 5-methylcytosine (5mC), exist in genomic DNA of diverse species (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Cheng, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Ratel et al., 2006</xref>). All these DNA methylation modifications play important roles in controlling many biological functions (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2018b</xref>). As an epigenetic mechanism, DNA methylation refers to a process that methyl groups are transferred to DNA molecules and is essential in the normal development of organisms (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Bergman and Cedar, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Meissner, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">von Meyenn et al., 2016</xref>). Through DNA methylation, the activity of a DNA segment can be changed without changing its sequence. For example, gene transcription can be repressed when DNA methylation occurs at its promoter (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bird, 1992</xref>).</p>
    <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>, after a methyl group is transferred to the sixth position of adenine ring, under the catalysis action of methyltransferases, 6mA is formed. 6mA is a noncanonical DNA modification form in different eukaryotes at low levels (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Greer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Koziol et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Mondo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). 6mA in prokaryotes and eukaryotes shows similar characteristics (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Heyn and Esteller, 2015</xref>). It has diverse functions, including guiding the discrimination of an original DNA strand from a newly synthesized DNA strand (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Wion and Casadesus, 2006</xref>), regulating gene transcription (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2016</xref>), repressing transposable elements, and reducing the stability of base pairings (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Fang et al., 2012</xref>). Surprisingly, the methylation protection is an inheritable state, although it may be changed by environmental factors (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Wion and Casadesus, 2006</xref>). Therefore, it is worth underscoring the importance of 6mA throughout generations.</p>

    <p>Recent studies revealed the genome-wide distributions of 6mA in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Greer et al., 2015</xref>), vertebrates (e.g. frog and fish) (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Koziol et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), mammals (e.g., human and <italic>Mus. musculus</italic>) (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Zou et al., 2018a</xref>), fungi (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Mondo et al., 2017</xref>), and vascular plants (e.g. rice) (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). Although these studies testified the presence of 6mA in eukaryotic genomes based on experimental means and indeed achieved encouraging results, the implication of 6mA in epigenetics is still obscure (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Ratel et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, in eukaryotes, the level of 6mA was so low that it could only be detected by advanced techniques. In rice, with two antibodies, based on SMRT and IP-seq, <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al. (2018)</xref> found that AGG-rich sequences were the most significantly enriched for 6mA. Thus, the computational prediction of 6mA sites may be a good choice to reduce experimental costs and guide the experimental study on plant 6mA.</p>
    <p>In fact, several computational methods have been applied in the identification of DNA methylation sites. Based on the data of experimentally confirmed 4mC sites,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. (2017)</xref> firstly developed a predictor called iDNA4mC to identify 4mC sites, in which DNA samples were formulated with nucleotide frequency and nucleotide chemical property. Then, based on the dataset (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">He et al. (2018a)</xref> established another tool named 4mCPred, and <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al. (2018b)</xref> built a new predictor (4mcPred-SVM) to predict 4mC sites. Recently, a free tool called iDNA6mA-PseKNC was constructed for the computational prediction of 6mA sites (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2019</xref>). The tool could be used to identify 6mA sites in <italic>Mus. musculus</italic> genome. However, the tool could not provide valuable data contained in plant genomes due to the difference between mammal and plant genomes. Thus, it is necessary to develop a 6mA site predictor for plant genomes. Recently, a tool named i6mA-Pred was constructed to identify 6mA site in rice (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). The tool could realize the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auROC) of 0.886 in jackknife cross-validation. However, the database used was not large enough, and the accuracy should be further improved.</p>
    <p>In view of the aforementioned descriptions, this study aims to develop a new method and establish an efficient tool to identify 6mA sites in the rice genome. A flowchart is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>. We firstly collected the existing data in the rice genome, including experimentally confirmed non-6mA sequences and 6mA sequences and built a benchmark dataset based on the report by <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al. (2018)</xref>. Subsequently, three kinds of sequence encoding features were proposed to formulate samples as the input of the Random Forest algorithm (RF) to discriminate 6mA sequences from non-6mA sequences. Then, several experiments were performed to investigate the prediction capability of the proposed method. Finally, on the basis of the method, we established a predictor called iDNA6mA-Rice.</p>

      <title>Benchmark Dataset</title>
      <p>A benchmark dataset is important in building a reliable prediction model. By combining immunoprecipitation with single-molecular real-time sequencing approach, 6mA sites in the rice genome had been detected (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>) and deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, which was created and is maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Long et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, a total of 265,290 6mA sites containing sequences were obtained from GEO. All of these sequences in GEO are 41 nt long with the 6mA site at the center. To reduce homologous bias and avoid redundancy (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Su et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Zou et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2019</xref>), sequences with the similarity above 80% were excluded by using the CD-HIT program (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Li and Godzik, 2006</xref>). Finally, we obtained 154,000 6mA sites-contained sequences as positive samples.</p>
      <p>Negative samples were collected from NCBI (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/10">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/10</uri>) and according to the following three rules. Firstly, the 41-nt long sequences with adenine at the center were selected. Secondly, experimental results proved that the centered adenine was not methylated. Thirdly, <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al. (2018)</xref> believed that 6mA most frequently occurred at GAGG, AGG, and AG motifs, so we statistically analyzed the ratios of GAGG, AGG, and AG motifs in positive samples and reported the result in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>. Based on the result in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>, we selected the negative samples with the same ratio of motifs so that the negative data were more objective. In this way, a large number of negative samples were obtained. In machine learning processes, imbalanced datasets lead to unreliable results. To balance positive and negative samples, 154,000 non-modified segments were randomly picked out as negative samples in model training. Finally, the benchmark dataset contained 154,000 positive samples and 154,000 negative samples. The benchmark dataset <bold>S</bold> is formulated as:</p>

      <title>Random Forest Algorithm</title>
      <p>The RF algorithm has been extensively applied in computational biology (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Lv et al., 2019</xref>), since it is a flexible and practical machine learning method and can deal with many input variables without variable deletion and provide an internal unbiased estimate of the generalization error. According to the principle of RF, many trees are randomly generated with the recursive partitioning approach, and then, the results are aggregated according to voting rules. In this study, the number of trees is set to 100 with the seed of 1. The details of RF had been described by <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Breiman (2001)</xref>.</p>

      <p>Cross-validation test is a statistical analysis method for assessing a classifier. For the purpose of saving computation time, the fivefold cross-validation test was performed to assess the method proposed in this study. We used four metrics [Matthew’s correlation coefficient (<italic>MCC</italic>), sensitivity (<italic>Sn</italic>), overall accuracy (<italic>Acc</italic>), and specificity (<italic>Sp</italic>)] to measure the predictive capability of our model (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Zuo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Zou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Manavalan and Lee, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Manavalan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>).</p>

      <p>To investigate the nucleotide distribution around the 21st site (6mA or non 6mA) in positive and negative samples, the pLogo (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">O’Shea et al., 2013</xref>) was plotted to analyze the statistical difference of nucleotide occurrence between two kinds of samples. The 6mA samples were dramatically different from non-6mA samples in terms of nucleotide compositions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). The nucleotide composition bias regions existed in the ranges from -8 to +10 sites and from +15 to +18 downstream of the 6mA site. Unlike the distribution in the non-6mA samples, a consensus motif of AAAA was observed in the upstream of the 6mA site. These results suggested that it was feasible to construct a machine learning model for identifying 6mA sites with extracted sequence features.</p>

      <p>KNFC is a commonly used feature extractor technique and has been successfully applied in DNA regulatory element prediction. However, the results in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref> showed that the accuracy of KNFC was only 68.3%, which was far from satisfactory. For the 41-nt long 6mA samples, KNFC is a high-dimension vector (16 + 64 + 256), which is so large that many elements in feature vector are zero. Although high-dimension features contain more information, more noise and redundant information are also included, thus decreasing the discrimination capability. Therefore, KNFC is not suitable for 6mA identification. In fact, the NV is the worst descriptor among all features in this study, since it can only obtain the overall accuracy of 54.3%, which almost equals the accuracy of random guess. The reason for the poor performance of NV in 6mA prediction is that NV contains too few features to capture enough sequence information of 6mA and non-6mA samples.</p>
      <p>For the combinations of different features, if MNBE was included, the prediction performances are always good. However, they are still not higher than those obtained with MNBE alone. Thus, subsequent studies were based on MNBE.</p>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of Different Algorithms</title>
      <p>It is natural to ask whether other classification is better than RF in 6mA identification. Thus, we investigated the discriminant capabilities of three algorithms, namely, Naïve Bayes, Bayes Net, and Logistic Regression, with the benchmark dataset through fivefold cross-validation. All algorithms were implemented in WEKA (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Frank et al., 2004</xref>). The ROC curves were plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>). It is obvious that RF is the best one for 6mA prediction among four algorithms. Thus, the final model was built with RF.</p>

      <title>Performance Evaluation With an Independent Dataset</title>
      <p>We designed the third experiment to investigate the performance of our proposed predictor. In the experiment, an independent test set was collected from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</uri>) with the accession number GSE103145 (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). All the sequences were 41 nt long with the 6mA site at the center. After removing redundant information with CD-HIT program according to the cutoff of 60%, a total of 880 positive samples were obtained (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). The negative samples were also obtained from the rice genome. In the report by Zhou et al., 6mA most frequently occurs at GAGG motifs and seldom occurs in coding sequences (CDSs). Thus, negative samples were extracted from CDSs with GAGG motifs in the rice genome. In total, 880 negative samples with the sequence identity less than 60% were obtained. All negative samples were also 41 nt long with non-methylated adenosine at the center. The data were utilized as the benchmark dataset in i6mA-Pred (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). The details for the benchmark dataset are available at <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://lin-group.cn/server/iDNA6mA-Rice">http://lin-group.cn/server/iDNA6mA-Rice</uri>.</p>
      <p>We utilized these data to examine our proposed model (<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 4</bold></xref>). In total, 95.8% 6mA sites and 93.3% non-6mA sites were correctly identified, suggesting that the method was a powerful tool for identifying 6mA sites in rice genome.</p>

      <p>Subsequently, iDNA6mA-PseKNC (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2019</xref>) is a tool to identify 6mA sites in <italic>Mus. musculus</italic> genome, and it can identify 6mA sites in many other species with high success rates. Thus, it is necessary to compare our proposed method with it. We investigated the performance of our predictor and iDNA6mA-PseKNC based on the independent dataset used in this work. All compared results were recorded in <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 4</bold></xref>.

One may firstly click the “Web-server” button, then type or copy/paste DNA sequences in the input box, or upload the FASTA format file. Note that the length of each sequence should be greater than 41 nt. Subsequently, after clicking the “submit” button, the predicted results will appear on a new page. As described previously, the tool is simple and can provide a convenient way for users to identify putative 6mA sites in DNA of their interest.

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>This paper developed a computational method for the identification of 6mA sites in the rice genome. We designed several kinds of experiments to examine the performance of the proposed method, for example, the performance evaluation on different features, performance evaluation on different algorithms, performance evaluation based on different data ratios, performance evaluation with an independent dataset, and comparison with published methods. All results demonstrated that our proposed method could accurately recognize 6mA sites in the rice genome. For the convenience of most wet-experimental scholars, we established a free web server to predict 6mA sites. We anticipate that the web server can promote the efficient discovery of novel potential 6mA sites in the rice genome and facilitate the exploration of their functional mechanisms in gene regulation.</p>
