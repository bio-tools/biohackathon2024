      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>The utilization of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) for B-cell receptor (BCR) immune repertoire analysis has become widespread in the fields of adaptive immunity and antibody drug development. However, the sheer volume of sequences generated by these experiments presents a challenge in data processing. Specifically, multiple sequence alignment (MSA), a critical aspect of BCR analysis, remains inadequate for handling massive BCR sequencing data and lacks the ability to provide immunoglobulin-specific information. To address this gap, we introduce Abalign, a standalone program specifically designed for ultrafast MSA of BCR/antibody sequences. Benchmark tests demonstrate that Abalign achieves comparable or even better accuracy than state-of-the-art MSA tools, and shows remarkable advantages in terms of speed and memory consumption, reducing the time required for high-throughput analysis from weeks to hours. In addition to its alignment capabilities, Abalign offers a broad range of BCR analysis features, including extracting BCRs, constructing lineage trees, assigning VJ genes, analyzing clonotypes, profiling mutations, and comparing BCR immune repertoires. With its user-friendly graphic interface, Abalign can be easily run on personal computers instead of computing clusters. Overall, Abalign is an easy-to-use and effective tool that enables researchers to analyze massive BCR/antibody sequences, leading to new discoveries in the field of immunoinformatics.

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>B cells are essential components of the immune system, playing a crucial role in protecting the body against various pathogens. These cells are able to recognize antigens through their B-cell receptors (BCRs), and through somatic hypermutation (SHM) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and class switch recombination (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), they are able to evolve their BCRs and produce antibodies with increased affinity to the antigens (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). This has led to the widespread adoption of BCR sequencing in the study of infectious diseases, allergies, vaccination, autoimmune disorders, tumor immunity, and microbiota(<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5–9</xref>). Sequencing BCR involves the sequencing of the entire BCR gene, or a portion of it, from a large number of individual B cells. This generates a comprehensive dataset of BCR sequences, known as the ‘BCR repertoire’, demonstrating the picture of BCR landscape. The analysis of the BCR repertoires enables us to understand the diversity and evolution of BCRs over time, and provides insights into the specificity of the B cell population. Furthermore, researchers can identify antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that can be used in the development of therapeutic antibodies for the treatment of various diseases (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>
    <p>BCR repertoire analysis generally involves pre-processing of the data, followed by analysis to infer the B cell population structure and to quantify detailed features (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Pre-processing assembles high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data into error-corrected BCR sequences, which are then aligned to identify the V(D)J germline genes. It has been addressed by many HTS tools and specialized methods such as TRUST4 (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), CATT (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), MiXCR (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), IgReC (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), pRESTO (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and IMSEQ (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The inference of B cell population structure infers the dynamic adaptive B cell response of the BCR repertoire upon clonal expansion and affinity maturation (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The quantitative features characterize complementarity-determining regions, clonal groups, B-cell lineage trees, SHMs, BCR diversity and etc. Numerous BCR tools have been developed independently such as IgBLAST (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), IMGT/HighV-QUEST (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) for V(D)J genes annotation, AbNum (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), ANARCI (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and AbRSA (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) for antibody numbering, VDJtools (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), IMonitor (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), BRepertoire (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), ImmunediveRsity (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), Vidjil (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), partis (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), IGoR (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), IgAT (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), IMEX (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) for BCR diversity, hypermutation probability and clone tracking. Despite these methods, a crucial method, multiple sequence alignment (MSA), remains inadequate for handling the large number of BCR sequencing data and lacks the ability to provide immunoglobulin-specific information. And it further limits the application of grouping clones, constructing lineage trees, analyzing SHMs, antibody engineering, structure modeling and more.</p>
    <p>MSA is the alignment of multiple sequences to illustrate their functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships. It is one of the most widely used modeling methods in biology today (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). However, generating accurate MSA can be challenging, as it is known to be an NP-complete problem. As a result, most MSA methods rely on heuristics that use an estimated guide tree to perform progressive alignment (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Even though the state-of-the-art large-scale MSA methods such as Clustal Omega (ClustalO) (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), MAFFT (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), MUSCLE(<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), PASTA (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), SATé-II (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), are ineffective in handling massive BCR sequencing data. Processing a typical 1GB BCR sequencing data set can be a time-consuming task, which often needs several weeks as well as huge memory demands using computing clusters. What is more, the high diversity of BCRs, generated by the processes of V(D)J gene segments recombination and SHMs, results in an over-insertion problem (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), which has become a bottleneck in the analysis of BCR data. To address the issue, it would be beneficial for MSA to introduce the human knowledge about BCR sequence patterns. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, there are no such MSA methods currently available.</p>
    <p>BCR/antibody sequences exhibit region-specific features, with complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) displaying a high degree of diversity and framework regions (FRs) being more conserved. Certain residue sites tend to remain invariant, while others are prone to insertion and deletion. These features can be summarized by antibody numbering, which is an immunoinformatic technique that enables standardization of the residue indexes of an antibody variable domain. We previously developed AbRSA (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), a highly robust method for antibody numbering. Building on AbRSA, we have now proposed Abalign, a new MSA method specifically designed for BCRs. Unlike existing MSA tools that rely on guide trees, Abalign performs the alignment using well-characterized antibody numbering information. Independent benchmark tests show that Abalign outperforms existing MSA tools in terms of speed, alignment quality, and memory consumption, reducing the time required for high-throughput analysis from weeks to hours. Abalign has been implemented in user-friendly graphic interfaces and integrated with a range of approaches for BCR repertoire analysis based on MSA, including constructing B-cell lineage trees, assigning VJ genes, analyzing clonotypes, humanizing antibody, and comparing BCR immune repertoires. Details on these features will be provided in the following sections.</p>

      <title>MSA algorithm</title>
      <p>Abalign performs the alignment guided by well-characterized antibody numbering schemes such as IMGT (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), Kabat (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), Chothia (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) and Martin (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). This process is divided into two steps (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Firstly, each of the query sequences is aligned to the pre-designed consensus sequences of the antibody as described in AbRSA. This alignment marks the residues of the query sequences with standardized index numbers, which are then stored in a matrix. Each row of the matrix stores a sequence, while each column contains roughly aligned residues. Secondly, the matrix is expanded, since one numbering position may contain multiple residues according to the scheme. To extend these positions, gaps must be inserted into the positions which have fewer residues in the same column. Abalign takes into account the different levels of conservativeness in FRs and CDRs and employs different strategies accordingly. In FRs, Abalign searches for the maximum number of residues at each position in a column and inserts the gaps at position <inline-formula><tex-math id="M0001" notation="LaTeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <p>It is worth noting that the results of the MSA may exhibit minor discrepancies depending on the selected numbering scheme, owing to differences in the definition of CDRs and insertion positions. In the following work, we have used the Chothia scheme as the default.</p>

      <title>Germline genes</title>
      <p>The germline gene is identified by comparing a query sequence to the germline sequence set taken from IMGT (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) database following the method of IgBLAST (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). To accelerate this process, Abalign performed antibody numbering for the germline sequences in advance. Therefore, after MSA, the query sequences are mapped to these germline sequences automatically.</p>

      <title>MSA benchmark sets</title>
      <p>Structure-based alignments have been widely used as the reference for MSAs (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46–48</xref>). To evaluate our method, we constructed a structure-based benchmark set containing 1800 non-redundant antibody crystal structures selected from the antibody structural database SAbDab (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) using the criteria of resolution &lt;3.0 Å. Those structures were split into heavy and light chains and divided into 36 groups (18 groups each for heavy and light chains) randomly, each of which contains 100 structures. For each group, the chains followed by structural alignment using a rapid structure alignment tool Caretta (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) to generate the structure-based reference MSAs (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). In some cases that Caretta cannot correctly align the structures, we employed TM-align (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) to correct these alignments.</p>
      <p>To evaluate the high-throughput performance of Abalign, we constructed another benchmark data set using the BCR sequencing data from the immune repertoire database OAS (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). We obtained BCR immune repertoire sequencing data from SARS-CoV-2 patients (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S3</xref>) to measure the running speed and memory consumption. We randomly selected 1000(1K), 2000(2K), 4000(4K), 8000(8K), 16 000(16K), 32 000(32K), 64 000(64K), 128 000(128K), 256 000(256K), and 512 000(512K) sequences to construct 10 subsets. Additionally, we utilized the STRIKE(<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) score to assess the quality of MSAs with a huge number of BCR sequences, which requires additional antibody structures as templates. 100 antibodies were selected randomly from the structure-based benchmark sets (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) for repeating STRIKE tests 100 times.</p>

      <title>MSA assessment criteria</title>
      <p>SP (Sum of Pairs) and TC (Total Column) scores have been widely used in assessing MSA results (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54–56</xref>). SP score measures the fraction of aligned residue pairs in the reference alignment that agree to the tested alignment. TC score measures the fractions of columns that are totally aligned.</p>
      <p>STRIKE (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) score is also employed to assess MSA results. Unlike SP and TC scores which need reference alignment and annotation information, STRIKE score only requires one protein structure for a whole MSA. Hence, STRIKE score can be applied to assess MSA with a huge number of BCR sequences.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC2-5">
      <title>Software implementation</title>
      <p>Abalign is a versatile visualization software that can be used across multiple platforms. The program utilizes standard C++ to implement MSA and germline gene identification, which allows for efficient parallel computing. Additionally, Abalign's user-friendly GUI and other advanced features are implemented with Python 3.8. The plotting is done by using matplotlib and seaborn. The B-cell lineage tree is constructed with FastTree2 (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>) and ETE3 (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Other modules for plotting include WebLogo (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), seqLogo (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>) and UpSet (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). To ensure software reliability, Abalign has been tested on Linux (Ubuntu versions 18.04, 20.04, 22.04), Windows (versions 7, 10, 11), and macOS (versions 10.14, 10.15, 11.6, 12.4).</p>

      <title>MSA benchmarking</title>
      <p>Most MSA benchmarking methods use 3D-structure-based reference MSAs as the gold standard and evaluate the differences between the tested and referenced MSAs using statistical scores such as SP and TC (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54–56</xref>). The SP score measures the fraction of aligned residue pairs in the alignment that agree to the tested alignment, while the TC score counts the fraction of columns that are exactly aligned. To evaluate Abalign's performance, we constructed 3D-structure-based reference MSAs using 1800 antibody structures from the SAbDab database (Materials and Methods). We also compared Abalign with three state-of-the-art MSA tools (MUSCLE, Clustal Omega (ClustalO), and MAFFT). Our results demonstrate that Abalign achieves the SP (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>) and TC (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>) scores of 0.955 and 0.653 for heavy chains, and 0.976 and 0.889 for light chains (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>), respectively. Abalign shows comparable or even better performance than MUSCLE (0.949, 0.645 for heavy chains and 0.973, 0.833 for light chains) and ClustalO (0.950, 0.638 for heavy chains and 0.971, 0.845 for light chains), and surpasses MAFFT (0.770, 0.568 for heavy chains and 0.946, 0.778 for light chains) significantly in this test. Further analysis demonstrates that Abalign excels in accurately aligning highly conserved motifs, while preserving the clear demarcation between FRs and CDRs (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). This sets it apart from other methods which often introduce blurring in the boundaries between these regions. These findings highlight the effectiveness of Abalign in conducting BCR-specific MSA tasks.</p>

We split the sequences into 10 datasets, and each dataset produced a multiple sequence alignment and a TC score.

      </fig>
      <p>In order to evaluate Abalign's high-throughput performance, we tested it on another dataset containing 1 023 000 BCR sequences (Materials and Methods). We measured the accuracy using the STRIKE score, which allows for 3D-structure-based evaluation without reference alignment. To assess the performance as the data size increased, we divided the dataset into 10 subsets, each containing 1000, 2000, 4000, …, 512 000 sequences, respectively. Our results show that Abalign significantly outperforms the other three state-of-the-art methods in terms of STRIKE score, and maintains its high stability in all the subsets (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). This result can be attributed to the fact that Abalign utilizes antibody numbering to assign the positions of each residue. As a result, the positions are not influenced by other sequences in the MSA, and therefore, the accuracy of the results is maintained even when the data size increases. Conversely, ClustalO and MAFFT demonstrate a significant decrease in performance, primarily because of their tendency to blur the boundaries between FRs and CDRs as the data size increases (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>). We also observed the performance of MUSCLE, exhibiting relative stability in heavy chains, which may attribute to its divide-and-conquer algorithm (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). However, similar to Clustal Omega and MAFFT, its performance decreases in light chains due to its inability to accurately align FR4 (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3B</xref>).</p>
      <p>Efficiency is a crucial factor when it comes to processing large-scale BCR sequencing data. Using a Ryzen 2990WX CPU with 16 threads, Abalign is able to complete the alignment of the above 512000 sequences in just 6 minutes. This is notably faster than MUSCLE, Clustal Omega, and MAFFT, which takes 53, 13 and 7 times longer, respectively (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). In terms of memory consumption, Abalign also outperforms these other methods. It uses only 2.3 GB of memory, which is 20%, 34% and 67% size of the others, respectively (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). These differences become even more pronounced as the size of the input data increases.</p>

      <title>Input format</title>
      <p>Abalign accepts nucleotide or protein sequence files in the FASTA format. To ensure accuracy, we recommend performing an error-correction process for BCR repertoire sequencing data with unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) using tools such as pRESTO (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), or MIGEC (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Once the sequences are loaded into Abalign, they will be immediately displayed in the visualization window (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>).</p>

    <sec id="SEC3-4">
      <title>MSA</title>
      <p>Abalign is capable of automatically identifying whether the input sequence is a BCR heavy or light chain sequence. Upon performing MSA, Abalign will obtain the antibody numbering indexes, delimited FRs and CDRs, as well as the VJ germline genes simultaneously. The resulting MSA will be displayed in Abalign's visual interface (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>), enabling users to easily investigate and explore the details of their results.</p>

    <sec id="SEC3-5">
      <title>Clonal grouping</title>
      <p>To comprehensively assess the composition of BCR repertoires, sequences from the same primitive B cell that differ only by their SHM processes are typically grouped together (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). One common approach is with high CDR3 homology, as well as identical CDR3 length and VJ gene usage (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). Abalign offers tunable clonotype definition schemes, including those based on identical VJ genes, identical CDR3 length, and CDR3 sequence identity to cluster sequences.</p>

    <sec id="SEC3-6">
      <title>B-cell lineage tree</title>
      <p>B-cell lineage trees are branching diagrams that display the ancestral relationships and developmental stages among individual B cells, providing valuable information on the temporal ordering of mutations, affinity maturation, and selection processes (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). Abalign employs an evolutionary tree module called FastTree2 (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>) that allows for the construction of B-cell lineage trees for aligned sequences and visualizes it with ETE3 (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Additionally, Abalign enables specific annotations on the tree, including abundance of branches, maturation tracks, and aligned sequences. Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref> provides an example of a B-cell lineage tree generated and displayed by Abalign using the BCR repertoires from COVID-19 patients.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC3-7">
      <title>Mutation profiling</title>
      <p>During adaptive immune responses, B cells undergo SHM. A critical step in B cell sequence analysis is identifying these somatic mutations by comparing them to their germline state. Abalign accounts for biases in observed mutation patterns due to positive and negative selection pressures using the MSA results. Abalign demonstrates the mutation profiles through colored blocks, indicating the increased or decreased frequency of replacement mutations, as evidence of antigen-driven positive or negative selection, respectively. Users can gain insights into the contribution of residue mutations to affinity maturation. Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref> provides an example of the mutation profile of COVID-19 patients.</p>

      <title>Diversity statistics</title>
      <p>The quantification of BCR repertoire diversity is informative of an individual's immune status (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Abalign provides commonly used diversity assessments of clonotypes, such as the Shannon-Weiner index, Gini-Simpson index, Shannon evenness and Simpson evenness (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). These assessments can be used to infer potential changes in clonotypes during the generation of adaptive immune responses (as depicted in Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). Abalign also allows for counting dynamic changes in the length of the variable domain and differences in VJ gene usage (as illustrated in Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>–<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">H</xref>), which provides a comprehensive view of the dynamics of immune status.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC3-9">
      <title>Repertoire comparison</title>
      <p>Abalign enables users to track longitudinal changes in clonotypes, which is useful for studying antibody maturation and evolution during disease progression. Furthermore, quantifying the overlap of clonotypes across multiple samples can provide essential insights into developing monoclonal antibodies and screening disease markers. Abalign can screen for expanded clonotypes by longitudinally profiling BCR repertoires and generate public sets from multiple individuals. Additionally, Abalign can draw different types of plots that highlight specific features of these data (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3I</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">J</xref>, and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>).

Abalign includes the MSA result of human BCR/antibody sequences from the OAS immune repertoire database, as well as residue probabilities at each position. Abalign can assess the humanness of the query antibody by detecting the popularity of residues and plotting a comparison figure to aid in engineering unusual residues (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3K</xref>).</p>

    <title>CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES</title>
    <p>High-throughput sequencing of B-cell immune repertoires is revolutionizing our ability to profile the adaptive immune response against a wide range of diseases. However, this produces hundreds of millions of sequences that require specialized bioinformatics tools for analysis. In this work, we propose an integrated analyzing platform capable of handling massive BCR sequencing data through ultrafast MSA. The platform enables intensive computation on personal computers, eliminating the need for high-performance computing clusters. Abalign's unique feature of ultrafast MSA produces results consistent with well-established antibody numbering schemes, enabling it to seamlessly connect with a broad range of BCR data analysis. Users can perform various analyses, including clonal grouping, lineage tree construction, mutation profiling, diversity statistics, VJ gene assignment, repertoire comparison and more, without the need for programming scripts. Overall, Abalign represents a powerful and accessible tool for analyzing BCR sequencing data, providing a much-needed solution for researchers in the field of immunology.</p>
    <p>Although Abalign offers advanced features, there are still some shortcomings that we aim to address in our subsequent work. One of these limitations is that Abalign ignores annotation information such as isotype (e.g. IgM, IgG) correlated with the sequence. Another limitation is that Abalign cannot currently handle T-cell receptor sequences, which are another key component in the analysis of immune repertoires. We are working to address these limitations in future versions of Abalign. By incorporating user feedback and our efforts, we hope to make Abalign an increasingly useful tool for the analysis of immune repertoires.</p>
