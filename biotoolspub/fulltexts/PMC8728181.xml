      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Repeats are prevalent in the genomes of all bacteria, plants and animals, and they cover nearly half of the Human genome, which play indispensable roles in the evolution, inheritance, variation and genomic instability, and serve as substrates for chromosomal rearrangements that include disease-causing deletions, inversions, and translocations. Comprehensive identification, classification and annotation of repeats in genomes can provide accurate and targeted solutions towards understanding and diagnosis of complex diseases, optimization of plant properties and development of new drugs. RepBase and Dfam are two most frequently used repeat databases, but they are not sufficiently complete. Due to the lack of a comprehensive repeat database of multiple species, the current research in this field is far from being satisfactory. LongRepMarker is a new framework developed recently by our group for comprehensive identification of genomic repeats. We here propose msRepDB based on LongRepMarker, which is currently the most comprehensive multi-species repeat database, covering &gt;80 000 species. Comprehensive evaluations show that msRepDB contains more species, and more complete repeats and families than RepBase and Dfam databases.

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Repetitive sequences are abundantly distributed in the genomes of all viruses, bacteria, plants and animals (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). For example, they constitute up to 45% of the genome in Mouse and 50–70% in Human (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The repetitive sequences of the genome play a central role in the stability of the chromosome, the cell cycle and the regulation of gene expression, and they are also important substrates for genome evolution (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3–6</xref>). As an example, the number and types of repetitive sequences vary between organisms and may reflect how rapidly an organism evolves to changes in its environment (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Moreover, they are fundamental to the cooperative molecular interactions which form nucleoprotein complexes (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and have also been implicated in molecular and cellular dysfunction associated with human diseases (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). For instance, the tandem repeat expansion has been associated with &gt;40 monogenic disorders, which has recently been shown to be a major genetic contributor to frontotemporal dementia (FTD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the middle of which is the most common form of the motor neuron disease (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and the latter of which is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by atypical social function, communication deficits, restricted interests and repetitive behaviors (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref>). Besides, the expression of retrotransposition-competent transposable elements can lead to more insertions which can disrupt gene function or alter gene expression, contributing to complex diseases such as lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, neurological diseases, blood diseases (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref>), etc. Comprehensive identification, classification and annotation of repeats in genomes can provide accurate and targeted solutions towards understanding and diagnosis of complex diseases, optimization of plant properties and development of new drugs.</p>
    <p>To achieve these goals, an accurate and complete repeat database is essential. RepBase (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and Dfam (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) are two most frequently used repeat databases, but they are not sufficiently complete, because most of the repetitive sequences collected in these two libraries are obtained through some existing detection methods (such as RepeatScout (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and RepeatMasker (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>)). Due to the limitations of sequencing data and the defects in design of the detection principle, existing detection methods cannot accurately and comprehensively obtain the repetitive sequences of various species. For instance, in the Glycine max genome, when  the  combination of RepBase and Dfam is used as the repetitive sequence database, only 28.47% of bases can be annotated as LTR (Long Terminal Repeat) retrotransposons, whereas the expected proportion should  be about 42%  (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), which means that about 13.52% of LTR retrotransposons cannot be accurately annotated (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Table <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Due to the lack of a comprehensive repetitive sequence database of multiple species, the current research in this field is far from being satisfactory.</p>

    <p>LongRepMarker (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) is a new framework developed recently by our group for comprehensive identification of genomic repetitive sequences. Comprehensive evaluations carried out in the study of LongRepMarker not only show that LongRepMarker can achieve more satisfactory results than the existing detection methods, but can also discover a large number of new repeat sequences and families. We here propose msRepDB (<ext-link xlink:href="https://msrepdb.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/pages/msRepDB/index.html" ext-link-type="uri">https://msrepdb.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/pages/msRepDB/index.html</ext-link>) based on LongRepMarker, which is currently the most comprehensive multi-species repetitive sequence database, covering &gt;80 000 species. msRepDB takes the reference sequence or assembly of species as the input, and generates the masked sequences representing the detected repeats and comprehensive annotation report as the output. When the input data are reference sequences or assemblies, it should be in the FASTA format, and msRepDB matches all subsequences with the database to find out the repeated elements contained in those sequences, as well as their locations and types, and finally masks the repeated elements in the input sequence and generates an annotation report. msRepDB also provides query and download functions. Users can directly retrieve and download the repetitive elements and their classification information from msRepDB according to the taxon name or the family name. In addition, if the user does not have any data, but just a taxon name or a repeat family name, msRepDB will also retrieve all relevant contents from the database and provide download links (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p>
    <fig position="float" id="F2">
      <label>Figure 2.</label>

        <p>The function module display of the msRepDB database. The figure mainly shows the four function modules of the msRepDB database, namely ‘Search’, ‘Download’, ‘Online Masking’ and ‘Submit’, and the detailed fields of three detection reports namely ‘Classification Report’, ‘Annotation Report’ and ‘Mapping Report’. For example, the ‘Search’ module provides the following four functions: (1) searching repeats by species name; (2) searching repeats by species name and family name; (3) displaying all annotated repeats of the species; and (4) displaying all annotation repeats of the specific family of the species. As another example, there are six fields in the mapping report: ‘Mapping zero time’, ‘Mapping one time’, ‘Mapping multiple time’, ‘N50’, ‘N75’ and ‘N90’, where ‘Mapping zero time’ indicates the proportion of fragments that cannot be aligned to the reference genome; ‘Mapping one time’ indicates the proportion of fragments that can be aligned to only one location on the reference genome; ‘Mapping multiple time’ indicates the proportion of fragments that can be aligned to many locations on the reference genome; ‘N50’ indicates the length of the longest segment such that all the segments longer than this segment cover at least 50% of the total length of all segments; ‘N75’ indicates the length of the longest segment such that all the segments longer than this segment cover at least 75% of the total length of all segments; and ‘N90’ indicates the length of the longest segment such that all the segments longer than this segment cover at least 90% of the total length of all segments.</p>

      <title>Data collection and identification of repetitive sequences by using LongRepMarker</title>
      <p>To obtain a comprehensive repetitive sequence database of multiple species, we must collect the reference genomes or the assemblies of sequencing reads of these species in advance. The NCBI website (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>) is an important channel for obtaining these required data. For example, when we enter ‘<italic toggle="yes">human</italic>’ in the search box on the NCBI homepage and click the search button, the page will turn to the download interface of the Human reference genome ‘<italic toggle="yes">GRCH</italic>38.<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>13’. When we continue to follow the prompts to click on the links, we will get a compressed file named ‘<inline-formula><tex-math id="M0001" notation="LaTeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{wasysym}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{amsbsy}
\usepackage{upgreek}
\usepackage{mathrsfs}
\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}
\begin{document}
}{}$genome\_assemblies\_genome\_fasta.tar$\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula>’. After decompressing this compressed file, we will get a FASTA file named ‘<inline-formula><tex-math id="M0001a" notation="LaTeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{wasysym}

\begin{document}
}{}$GCF\_000001405.39\_ GRCh38.p13\_genomic.fna$\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula>’, which is the required Human reference genome.</p>
      <p>As mentioned before, compared with existing detection methods (such as RepeatScout (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), RepeatMasker (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), RepeatModeler2 (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), etc.), LongRepMarker can not only more completely identify repetitive sequences in the genome, but also achieve more prominent performance in discovering new repetitive sequences and families. Therefore, a more comprehensive multi-species repetitive sequence database can be constructed based on the detection results of LongRepMarker   (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/BioinformaticsCSU/LongRepMarker" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/BioinformaticsCSU/LongRepMarker</ext-link>). When the reference genome or the assembly of sequencing reads of species is inputted into the LongRepMarker, it will initiate the following steps to identify and annotate the repetitive sequences contained therein.</p>
      <list list-type="bullet">
        <list-item>
          <p><bold>Identification of overlap sequences</bold>. The repetition relation is a special case of the overlap relation. Thus all possible repetition relationship can be found by searching overlap sequences. Overlap sequences occupy only a small portion of the overall sequences. By finding the overlap sequences between assemblies or chromosomes, the algorithm locates the repetitive sequences faster and more accurately.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p><bold>Conversion of overlap sequences into unique</bold><italic toggle="yes"><bold>k-mers</bold></italic>. The number and length of sequences will have a great impact on the efficiency of multiple sequence alignment. Generally, the more the number and the longer the length, the greater the computational resource consumption. The unique <italic toggle="yes">k-mers</italic> (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) are much smaller than overlap sequences both in terms of number and length. Using unique <italic toggle="yes">k-mers</italic> instead of overlap sequences for mapping can greatly optimize the efficiency of multi-sequence alignment (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p>

          <p><bold>Generation of the multi-alignment unique</bold><italic toggle="yes"><bold>k-mers</bold></italic> <bold>and their coverage regions on overlap sequences</bold>. The multi-alignment unique <italic toggle="yes">k-mers</italic> were first proposed in the paper of LongRepMarker (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), which refers to the unique <italic toggle="yes">k-mers</italic> that can be aligned to multiple different locations in the overlap sequences. Due to the sequencing bias, the high frequency threshold is often difficult to obtain accurately, which has a great impact on the range of the high frequency <italic toggle="yes">k-mers</italic> (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29–31</xref>). However, the multi-alignment unique <italic toggle="yes">k-mers</italic> are not affected by these factors. By using the multi-alignment unique <italic toggle="yes">k-mers</italic> to identify repeats in overlap sequences, the algorithm can obtain the repeats in the genomes more comprehensively and stably.</p>

          <p><bold>Classification of regions on overlap sequences that can be covered by multi-alignment unique</bold><italic toggle="yes"><bold>k-mers</bold></italic>. Due to the short size of unique <italic toggle="yes">k-mers</italic>, it is easy to form a coupling alignment (coupling alignment refers to the fusion of unique <italic toggle="yes">k-mers</italic> that should not be fused together) (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). To eliminate the influence of the coupling alignment, the algorithm further classifies the regions on the overlap sequences covered by the multi-alignment unique <italic toggle="yes">k-mers</italic> into two categories, and filters out the false repetitive sequences, thereby improving the accuracy of the detection results.</p>

          <p><bold>Merging fragments with duplication or inclusion</bold>. The results of detection methods based on the multiple sequence alignment will inevitably contain redundant elements. In order to make the detection results as pure as possible without any impurities and redundancy, the algorithm merges the detected repetitive fragments with duplication and inclusion relationships (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p>

          <p><bold>Classification and annotation of the obtained repetitive sequences</bold>. When the repetitive sequences are obtained, the algorithm also needs to classify and annotate them, because the repeats without classification and annotation information are meaningless. In this step, a distributed RepeatClassifier (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) developed by our group is used to classify and annotate the obtained repetitive sequences.</p>
        </list-item>

      <p>Note that LongRepMarker is different from RepeatScout and RepeatModeler2 in detection targets. RepeatScout and RepeatModeler2 both focus on the discovery of repeated families. It is well known that a repeat family is an abstraction of a type of repeat sequence (a one-to-many relationship), and its acquisition must go through the two operations of merging the obtained repeat sequences and taking the consensus sequence. However, the detection goal of LongRepMarker is not to find repeated families, but to comprehensively mine all repeated sequences of the genome (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>), and provide a basis for accurately identifying the mutations that exist between different copies. Therefore, in the detection results of LongRepMarker, we merged duplicate copies with high consistency, and saved the duplicate copies with differences as much as possible, and at the same time analyzed the structural variation that occurred in the duplicate copies with differences. Our purpose is to provide a method to study the effect of variations that exist between different duplicate copies on the genetic, evolution and variation of organisms.</p>
      <p>Although there will be some redundancy and chimerism in the detection results of LongRepMarker, the repetitive sequences identified by it are still the most complete compared to other existing tools. In order to remove impurities and chimeras in the detection results and output purer repetitive sequences for the database construction, three steps of impurity removal, chimerism removal and consensus sequence construction are carried out after the detection results of LongRepMarker obtained. In this process, the strategies of wicker 80/80/80 rule (as used in RepeatScout), filtering overlaps whose identity is lower than 85% (as used in RepeatScout), and the cutoff score of 225 (as used in RepeatMasker) were used. When the purified repetitive sequences are generated, RepeatClassifier is used to classify and annotate these sequences. After that, the algorithm needs to merge the repeated sequences with its classification and annotation information, and form a file in the FASTA format (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). In this generated file in the FASTA format, the sequence composed of A/T/G/C characters is a repeating sequence, and the sequence starting with an angle bracket above the repeating sequence is the annotation sequence, which contains the corresponding classification and annotation information (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p>

    <title>IMPLEMENTATION</title>
    <p>The data processing and analysis functions of msRepDB database were implemented using Python v.3.6.9 (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.python.org/getit/" ext-link-type="uri">www.python.org/getit/</ext-link>) coupled with the SpringBoot integrated framework (<ext-link xlink:href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot" ext-link-type="uri">https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot</ext-link>). msRepDB runs on a Linux-based Maven server 3.8.1 (Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for java projects, <ext-link xlink:href="https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi" ext-link-type="uri">https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi</ext-link>). The database was developed using MySQL 5.7.31 (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.mysql.com/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.mysql.com/</ext-link>), and the web interface was developed using html5 markup language (<ext-link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5" ext-link-type="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5</ext-link>) combined with Bootstrap v.5.0.2 (<ext-link xlink:href="https://v3.bootcss.com" ext-link-type="uri">https://v3.bootcss.com</ext-link>), layUI v.2.6.8 (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.layui.com/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.layui.com/</ext-link>) and JQuery v.1.11.1 (<ext-link xlink:href="http://jquery.com" ext-link-type="uri">http://jquery.com</ext-link>) (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures S3– S8</xref>). In the process of online masking, two aligners, bwa (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) and minimap2 (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), were used. In this process, the short sequence fragments were aligned using bwa, and the long sequence fragments were aligned using minimap2.</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>Compared with the existing repeat databases, the major improvements of msRepDB are as follows: (i) msRepDB contains more species than RepBase and Dfam databases (i.e. &gt;84 000 in msRepDB versus about 62 000 in the combination of RepBase and Dfam). The comprehensive experiments carried out in the study of LongRepMarker not only show that LongRepMarker can achieve more satisfactory results than the existing detection methods (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables S4–S6</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures S9–S10</xref>), but also can discover a large number of new repeat sequences and families. (ii) For a single species, msRepDB contains more complete repeats and families than the existing repeat databases. We have conducted comprehensive experimental evaluations on the coverage and completeness of the msRepDB database. For example, we used the latest version of RepeatMasker (V.4.1.2) to classify and annotate the repeats of the species Human, Mouse, Rice, Glycine max and Drosophila based on the msRepDB database and the combination of the latest RepBase (V.26.06) and Dfam (V.3.3) libraries, respectively. The frequency and length distribution, the multiple alignment ratio, the proportion of coverage over the reference genome and the duplication ratio of the repetitive sequences contained in msRepDB and the combination of Dfam and RepBase databases are shown in Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. We can see that the repetitive sequences collected in the msRepDB database have a higher repetition frequency and larger size as a whole. Furthermore, from the perspective of multiple alignment ratio, coverage of the reference genome, and duplication ratio, the repetitive sequences contained in msRepDB are usually more accurate and less redundant than those contained in the combination of Dfam and RepBase databases. Here, the duplication ratio represents the total number of aligned bases in the repetitive sequences divided by the total number of those in the reference. If there are too many repetitive sequences that cover the same regions, the duplication ratio will be greatly increased. This occurs due to multiple reasons, including overestimating repeat multiplicities and overlaps between repetitive sequences.</p>

          <p>‘Num’ represents the number of fragments contained in database. ‘Max(bp)’ represents the length of the longest fragment in database. ‘N50’ represents the length of a fragment, such that all the fragments of at least the same length together cover at least 50% of the total length of all fragments contained in database. ‘N75’ represents the length of a fragment, such that all the fragments of at least the same length together cover at least 75% of the total length of all fragments contained in database. ‘N95’ represents the length of a fragment, such that all the fragments of at least the same length together cover at least 95% of the total length of all fragments contained in database. ‘MAR(%) and Non-MAR(%)’ respectively represent the ratios of multiple alignment and non-multiple alignment. ‘Reference(%)’ represents the proportion of covering the reference genome. ‘Duplication ratio’ represents the total number of aligned bases in the repetitive sequences divided by the total number of those in the reference. If there are too many repetitive sequences that cover the same regions, the duplication ratio will be greatly increased. This occurs due to multiple reasons, including overestimating repeat multiplicities and overlaps between repetitive sequences.</p>

It can be seen from the experimental results shown in Tables <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>– <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables S7–S12</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures S11–S26</xref> that msRepDB is the most complete multi-species repetitive sequence database at present. In order to evaluate the false positive rate of the detection results, we conducted the experiments on the simulated sequencing data for Drosophila, and then we used RepeatMasker to annotate the repeats, and used the annotated set as the ground-truth set to compare with the annotation from RepeatScout and from LongRepMarker (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S13</xref>). All the false positives are counted by comparing the ground-truth set of annotations with that of RepeatScout or LongRepMarker.</p>

          <p>The test results were obtained by using RepeatMasker based on the msRepDB database and the combination of Dfam and RepBase respectively under the default parameter settings.</p>
        </fn>
      </table-wrap-foot>
    </table-wrap>
    <p>The latest version of the Dfam database (v3.4) only contains the specific data of 552 species (<ext-link xlink:href="https://dfam.org/home" ext-link-type="uri">https://dfam.org/home</ext-link>), which can be further subdivided into unique data and the data fused with RepBase. In addition, the data of other species are directly inherited from RepBase (about 61 518 species). Compared with the latest version of the Dfam database, the msRepDB database currently collects the repetitive sequences of 84 601 species which are obtained based on the corresponding detection results of LongRepMarker after the two processes of removing impurities and chimeras, and constructing the consensus sequences (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables S1–S3</xref>). From the point of view of data integrity, msRepDB completely covers Dfam and RepBase, while providing data on some previously unlisted species.</p>
    <p>The continuous update, as well as the long-term operation and maintenance of the database are fundamental for its utility. Since the establishment of our database, we have collected all available genomes on the websites of NCBI-RefSeq (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/</ext-link>), Ensembl (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) (<ext-link xlink:href="http://asia.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html" ext-link-type="uri">http://asia.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html</ext-link>), FungiDB (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) (<ext-link xlink:href="https://fungidb.org/fungidb/app" ext-link-type="uri">https://fungidb.org/fungidb/app</ext-link>) etc. based on the species name, NCBI accession number and taxid. The specific update measures are as follows. Firstly, we will further expand the coverage of species, and strive to build the most complete and accurate multi-species repetitive sequence database in field of genomic repetitive sequence research. Secondly, we will continue to improve the performance of the algorithm in the subsequent update process to achieve more accurate repeated sequences detection.</p>
    <p>From a functional point of view, msRepDB not only provides a more complete multi-species repeat sequence database for users to view and download, but also provides with online masking and annotation functions, which is a major feature of msRepDB. We have implemented many optimizations on the code of the online masking function, so that it can efficiently process large-scale sequences. With online masking and annotation function, users can directly use msRepDB to accurately and quickly annotate genomes or sequences of interest, and obtain detailed annotation reports without the aid of any other third-party tool. For instance, the online masking will be applied in the following scenarios. Numerous cancers, genetic disorders, neurological disorders, and metabolic disorders, have been associated with the Long Interspersed Element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposition (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42–44</xref>). When RepeatMasker uses msRepDB and the combination of Dfam and RepBase as databases to annotate repetitive sequences in the Human genome, the annotation results based on msRepDB contains 1 325 814 L1/CIN4 retrotransposon elements, with annotated base length of 623 904 329 bp. However, the corresponding annotation results based on the combination of Dfam and RepBase are 603 337 and 528 287 954 bp, respectively (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The same results can also be obtained through the online masking module of the msRepDB database website. Because the proposed database contains more complete repetitive sequences and efficient use interfaces, we believe that it can provide accurate and targeted solutions towards understanding and diagnosis of complex diseases, optimization of plant properties and development of new drugs, and thus greatly benefit the genome research.</p>
