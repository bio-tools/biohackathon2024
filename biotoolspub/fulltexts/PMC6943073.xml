      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Recent advances in genome sequencing and functional genomic profiling have promoted many large-scale quantitative trait locus (QTL) studies, which connect genotypes with tissue/cell type-specific cellular functions from transcriptional to post-translational level. However, no comprehensive resource can perform QTL lookup across multiple molecular phenotypes and investigate the potential cascade effect of functional variants. We developed a versatile resource, named QTLbase, for interpreting the possible molecular functions of genetic variants, as well as their tissue/cell-type specificity. Overall, QTLbase has five key functions: (i) curating and compiling genome-wide QTL summary statistics for 13 human molecular traits from 233 independent studies; (ii) mapping QTL-relevant tissue/cell types to 78 unified terms according to a standard anatomogram; (iii) normalizing variant and trait information uniformly, yielding &gt;170 million significant QTLs; (iv) providing a rich web client that enables phenome- and tissue-wise visualization; and (v) integrating the most comprehensive genomic features and functional predictions to annotate the potential QTL mechanisms. QTLbase provides a one-stop shop for QTL retrieval and comparison across multiple tissues and multiple layers of molecular complexity, and will greatly help researchers interrogate the biological mechanism of causal variants and guide the direction of functional validation.

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed tens of thousands of genomic loci associated with numerous traits and diseases; however, the underlying causal mechanism often remains poorly understood (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref>). Causal genetic variants alter initial molecular phenotypes, such as chromatin states, and induce a cascade of biological effects, ultimately contributing to the development of traits and diseases (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref>). Exploiting such genotype–phenotype causality would facilitate in-depth understanding of the genetic basis of complex traits. Recent advances in genome sequencing and functional genomic profiling have promoted many large-scale quantitative trait locus (QTL) studies (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), which connect genotypes with tissue/cell type-specific cellular functions (i.e. molecular traits quantified by various high-throughput assays) in different biological stages. For example, QTL mapping has been used to study the genetic determination of chromatin accessibility (caQTL), DNA methylation (mQTL) and histone modification (hQTL) in epigenetic regulation; gene expression (eQTL) and alternative splicing (sQTL) in transcriptional regulation; RNA editing (reQTL) and competing endogenous RNA expression (cerQTL) in post-transcriptional regulation; ribosome occupancy (riboQTL) and protein expression (pQTL) in translational regulation; and cell metabolism (metaQTL) in post-translational regulation (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Here, genomic loci that explain all or a fraction of variation in a given molecular trait are referred to as xQTLs.</p>
    <p>For fundamental interpretation of the genetic basis of human complex traits, researchers have in the last decade performed extensive eQTL studies on most human tissues (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and immune cell types (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) by leveraging gene expression as molecular readouts. As the majority of GWAS trait/disease-associated variants are located in the noncoding genomic regions, the overwhelming increase in eQTL data has greatly facilitated the discovery of novel disease genes and benefits the dissection of variant regulatory mechanisms in a context-dependent manner (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Several resources, including eQTL Browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eqtl.uchicago.edu">http://eqtl.uchicago.edu</ext-link>), seeQTL (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), ExSNP (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and ImmuneRegulation (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), have been developed for compiling the eQTL results for certain tissue/cell types. However, gene expression only partially explains trait heritability and is not likely to describe most risk mechanisms (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>); therefore, there is an urgent need to comprehensively integrate the published xQTL summary statistics for various molecular phenotypes. Although several GWAS databases, such as GRASP (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and PhenoScanner (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), have begun to provide xQTL summary statistics in recent updates, they only incorporate a small fraction of studies on limited tissue/cell types. In addition, emerging data show that specific types of QTL can be mediated through other fine-scale molecular processes, for example, most eQTLs exert their genetic effect on gene expression through altering open chromatin (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), DNA methylation (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), histone modification (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), transcription factor binding (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), chromatin interaction (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) or other post-transcriptional events (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>); pQTLs without corresponding <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs can exert genetic effects on mRNA decoys (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), alternative splicing (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) or ribosome occupancy (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Therefore, exploring the causal relationships among the molecular phenotypes at specific risk loci is essential for in-depth understanding of the genetic mechanism of complex traits. Unfortunately, no resource can facilitate cross-QTL investigation of genetic variants and the various molecular phenotypes. Last but not least, translating genetic association with causality from genome-wide QTL signatures requires functional prioritization and follow-up validation; hence, there is a great need for the integration of large-scale tissue/cell type-specific functional genomics data and allele-specific annotations for identifying causal variants (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p>
    <p>In this work, we manually curated 233 independent QTL studies across 13 human molecular traits and mapped them to 78 human tissue/cell types. We standardized heterogeneous QTL results using a uniform process and compiled 712 unique QTL summary statistics. By designing a highly interactive web function, we constructed a versatile database, QTLbase, which allows users to query, compare and visualize QTLs at tissue-wise, phenome-wise and variant-wise levels. QTLbase also incorporates large-scale tissue/cell type-specific genomic features and functional annotations to interpret the underlying QTL mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, QTLbase is unique and the most comprehensive resource for exploring the association between genetic variants and the diverse molecular phenotypes in humans. It is free to all and can be accessed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mulinlab.org/qtlbase">http://mulinlab.org/qtlbase</ext-link> or <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mulinlab.tmu.edu.cn/qtlbase">http://mulinlab.tmu.edu.cn/qtlbase.</ext-link></p>

    <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
    <sec id="SEC2-1">
      <title>Data curation and processing</title>
      <p>We manually curated QTL studies of human molecular phenotypes from the literature by searching PubMed and Google Scholar using QTL-relevant keywords, such as specific xQTL terms, as well as specific descriptions of molecular phenotypes. Both <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-QTL studies were included, and we incorporated molecular traits, whether studied in normal, treated or diseased tissue/cell types. To create an unbiased collection and to avoid potential data redundancy, we considered QTL data only from published articles that reported genome-wide primary QTL mapping or meta-analysis. Studies involving the reanalysis of existing QTL data or data from specific genomic loci were generally excluded. We also discarded less informative QTL results if variant, trait or <italic>P</italic>-value information were missing. A single QTL study may involve multiple tissue/cell types [e.g. GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression project) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and DICE (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)], various molecular phenotypes [e.g. BLUEPRINT (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>)], several human populations (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) or different mapping strategies (e.g. genotype-based and allele-specific); we split such QTL results into multiple sets and assigned unique source IDs to distinguish the data. To ensure recognized tissue/cell type naming, we mapped QTL-relevant tissue/cell types to a commonly used anatomogram that has been adopted in the GTEx and the EMBL-EBI Expression Atlas (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). For tissues with numerous QTLs analyzed in finely sorted subregions or cell types, such as whole blood and brain, we recorded both the main tissue together with the sub-tissue/cell type information. Population information was mapped to the five super populations (AFR [African], AMR [Ad Mixed American], EAS [East Asian], EUR [European] and SAS [South Asian]) in the 1000 Genomes project (1 KGP). If QTL mapping was conducted on samples from multiple populations, we designated the population as ‘MIX’.</p>

      <title>QTL summary statistics normalization</title>
      <sec id="SEC2-2-1">
        <title>Variant normalization</title>
        <p>As variant information may have been heterogeneous among the collected QTL data, we synchronized the originally recorded dbSNP IDs with those in dbSNP build 151 (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). For variants whose records provide only chromosome position, we first converted them to GRCh37 (Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 37) position using LiftOver (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and filled in the corresponding dbSNP ID. We identified the effective allele of each QTL from the original publication or related documents, and extracted the reference and alternative alleles from dbSNP build 151.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="SEC2-2-2">
        <title>Molecular trait normalization</title>
        <p>Given the complexity of molecular trait description and genomic coordinate recording, we normalized the molecular phenotypes according to different criteria. Briefly, for genes (including long noncoding RNA and small RNA) or transcript phenotypes, such as eQTL and sQTL, we transformed the name or position (if not provided) according to GENCODE Release 30 (GRCh37) (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). For phenotypes measured by microarray, such as most mQTLs, we recorded the probe ID as the trait name and the corresponding position described in the chip manifest file. For non-gene phenotypes measured by next-generation sequencing, the trait name was an abbreviation of the molecular phenotype together with the actual genomic position, for example, a hQTL was recorded as H3K27ac (chr1:1234–5678). If <italic>trans</italic>-QTL summary statistics were not provided, we defined a QTL as a <italic>trans</italic>-QTL if the associated trait was far from the variant location (&gt;10 Mb).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="SEC2-2-3">
        <title>Statistical value normalization</title>
        <p>Given the diverse QTL mapping strategies, the summary statistics format of the collected QTLs differed substantially. Typically, we expect QTLbase to contain important statistical values, including effective allele, <italic>P</italic>-value, effect size, standard error and false discovery rate. Effect size was normalized according to applied statistical methods, including β value, <italic>t</italic>-statistic, chi-squared statistic, odds ratio or logarithm of the odds (LOD) score. Standard error (if not provided) was inferred from the <italic>P</italic>-value, effect size and sample size using quantile function.</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC2-3">
      <title>Variant annotation integration</title>
      <p>We integrated 20 functional annotations into QTLbase, these annotations can be divided into four major categories according to usage: variant information, functional prediction, functional evidence and disease association. For variant information, we collected variant identity from dbSNP; and variant allele frequency was derived from gnomAD (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) and 1 KGP Phase 3 (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). For functional prediction, we incorporated many frequently used prediction scores, including aggregated conservation scores from CADD (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), aggregated noncoding variant prediction scores from regBase (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), aggregated missense mutation pathogenic scores from dbNSFP (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), aggregated splicing altering prediction scores from dbscSNV (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), aggregated miRNA target altering prediction scores from dbMTS (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), and several function predictions from HaploReg (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), RegulomeDB (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) and InterVar (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). For functional evidence, we integrated large-scale tissue/cell type-specific epigenomic profiling (e.g. histone modifications, transcription factor binding, open chromatin and nascent transcription) from different resources, such as the Roadmap Epigenomics Project (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), Cistrome DB (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) and the FANTOM5 project (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). For disease association, we included ClinVar-reported variants (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), DisGeNET-recorded variants (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) and ICGC somatic mutation information (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p>

      <title>Data summary of QTLbase</title>
      <p>The literature search initially retrieved hundreds of QTL analysis studies involving human molecular phenotypes. After strict screening and processing, up to August 2019, QTLbase included a total of 233 independent genome-wide QTL studies involving 712 unique QTL summary statistics across 13 molecular phenotypes and 78 tissue/cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S1 and S2</xref>). Among all collected xQTL summary statistics, 66.85% and 15.81% are from eQTL and mQTL, respectively; however, other QTL types, such as sQTL, pQTL, caQTL and hQTL, have recently emerged due to the increasing affordability of omics technologies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). A large number of xQTLs were from sub-tissue/cell types from whole blood (30.79%) and brain (14.56%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>) to ensure uniform naming, QTLbase mapped them to fine-scale terms, yielding 30 more tissue/cell types than the GTEx project (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Most xQTLs were identified in tissue/cell types from European populations (47.43%) or mixed populations (44.8%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Compared with GWAS on common traits/diseases, the majority of QTL studies were performed on limited sample sizes, with only 20 studies using &gt;3000 samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). However, xQTL analysis potentially has higher statistical power than GWAS.</p>

      <title>Use of QTLbase</title>
      <p>The August 2019 version of QTLbase incorporates 171 524 441 significant associations, namely 159 197 054 <italic>cis</italic>-QTLs and 12 327 387 <italic>trans</italic>-QTLs (<italic>P</italic>-value ≤ 0.05), across numerous genomic loci, molecular traits and tissue/cell types. Such a multidimensional data structure presents challenges in QTL querying and visualization. To facilitate novel discoveries using this high-content repository, we developed a rich web client by incorporating many interactive and user-friendly features. Generally, users can perform both variant- and trait-level queries, and the upcoming web pages enable highly interactive xQTL exploration at phenome-wise, tissue-wise and variant-wise levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Search by variant</title>
        <p>QTLbase accepts variant-level queries by either dbSNP ID or genomic position and displays query results on a dynamic web page. The left panel shows matched <italic>cis</italic>-xQTL types and the number of associated traits. Users can click on each QTL type to inspect detailed information in the panel on the right (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The top-right panel displays summary information about the selected QTL type, including the query variant, allele information, number of associated tissue/cell types, number of associated molecular traits, total QTL associations, and total <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-QTLs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Below this summary information, a zoomable heat map visualizes the distribution of the associated traits across tissue/cell types. Each column represents a QTL-associated trait; each row depicts a separate tissue/cell type. The grid color represents the median <italic>P</italic>-value of the QTLs on a particular trait and tissue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Clicking on each tissue row in the heat map opens a phenome-wise plot that displays the genomic distribution of the QTL-associated traits, accompanied by their significance and gene annotations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Clicking on each trait column in the heat map brings a tissue-wise plot to the front and shows the significance of the QTLs across the related tissue/cell types (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Users can adjust focused region size and decorate the plot using several advanced options. Clicking on each grid in the heat map will highlight the associated QTLs with the specific trait and tissue in both phenome- and tissue-wise plots. The plots are highly interactive and can be synchronized with the bottom summary statistics table, which is searchable and downloadable (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Furthermore, users can check variant functional annotations by clicking the ‘Show Annotation’ button: a floating panel will display extensive annotation information (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). Importantly, users can also switch to <italic>trans</italic>-xQTLs viewer or a tissue-oriented viewer for xQTL comparisons in this result page (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S6 and S7</xref>).</p>

      <title>Comparison with existing databases</title>
      <p>We compared QTLbase with five existing QTL resources for human molecular phenotypes. First, the existing QTL databases collect small numbers of independent QTL studies, and the largest ones, namely PhenoScanner (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and GRASP (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), contain &lt;30 independent studies. Second, the majority of these databases, such as ImmuneRegulation (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), ExSNP (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and seeQTL (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), only report eQTL results or involve far fewer other QTL types. Third, the current resources incorporate limited tissue/cell types, and the tissue/cell type descriptions are unclassified. However, QTLbase integrates far more xQTLs for various molecular phenotypes, and includes the most QTL-related tissue/cell types so far, mapping them to standardized terms. Importantly, QTLbase provides a highly interactive web page to facilitate researchers to compare QTLs at tissue-wise, phenome-wise and variant-wise levels, which is largely absent from the current resources. Finally, QTLbase incorporates large-scale functional annotations and tissue/cell type-specific genomic features for in-depth interpretation of xQTLs (see details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). In summary, to the best of our knowledge, QTLbase largely outperforms other databases and establishes the most comprehensive knowledge base for studying the associations between human genetic variants and molecular phenotypes.</p>

      <title>Case study</title>
      <p>We used a previously reported case to illustrate the validity and usefulness of QTLbase for identifying the potential functional effects of genetic variants. The case involved a platelet reactivity and cardiovascular disease-associated variant, rs12041331, that could reinforce its enhancer activity and affect <italic>PEAR1</italic> gene expression during megakaryopoiesis via an allele-specific effect on DNA methylation (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Specifically, the G allele of rs12041331 ensures fully methylated status and has higher enhancer activity; it was also found that the G allele is highly correlated with a CpG island in the <italic>PEAR1</italic> promoter and could reduce CTCF-binding affinity at the promoter through higher methylation, thereby liberating its enhancer activity and increasing <italic>PEAR1</italic> expression. QTLbase showed many pieces of evidence that could validate and support the genetic effect and possible regulatory mechanism of rs12041331 in different molecular traits (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). First, we found that rs12041331 was supported by three blood eQTL studies with large sample sizes (&gt;2000), and it was significantly associated with expression of the <italic>PEAR1</italic> gene (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54–56</xref>). Second, QTLbase showed that rs12041331 is also a hQTL linked to the enhancer marker H3K4me1 in several immune cells. The A allele of rs12041331 was associated with lower H3K4me1 levels around the <italic>PEAR1</italic> gene in naïve CD4+ T cells (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), indicating that it could modulate <italic>PEAR1</italic> gene expression by affecting histone modification. Notably, we found much mQTL evidence regarding rs12041331; it could alter a specific CpG site (cg20948486) at the <italic>PEAR1</italic> promoter in CD16+ neutrophils (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Finally, QTLbase functional annotations identified that rs12041331 overlapped with many tissue/cell-type specific epigenomic signals, such as histone modifications H3K4me1, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac in widespread cell types; DNase I-hypersensitive sites in immune cells; and transcription factor (e.g. NF-κB, STAT1, SPI1) binding in endothelial and immune cells. Taken together, these QTLbase-derived observations not only are consistent with the investigations of the original study, but also provide additional biological insights into the regulatory mechanism of rs12041331.</p>

    <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
    <p>In the post-GWAS era, interpreting risk variants that cause the development of complex diseases, and how, is a major, challenging task. Increasing xQTL studies on diverse molecular phenotypes have opened up a new avenue for interrogating mediation paths and cascade effects between genetic factors and complex diseases. By systematically curating and processing xQTL summary statistics, we developed the comprehensive knowledge base QTLbase for biologists and geneticists to query, compare and visualize xQTLs in a highly efficient and interactive manner. To the best of our knowledge, QTLbase is the largest database to integrate various QTL types across numerous tissue/cell types to enable evaluation of the possible molecular functions of genetic variants. We believe that this database will facilitate the QTL retrieval process for researchers and exploration of the underlying mechanisms of the genetic association of complex traits.</p>
    <p>Given the rapid development of advanced biotechnologies, new QTL types will continue to be identified at different molecular levels. During the curation and construction of QTLbase, we found that several newer QTL studies had connected genetic variants to more complex molecular phenotypes, such as CRD-QTLs, which correlate genetic effect with <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory domains representing local chromatin organization (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Therefore, QTLbase will integrate more novel QTLs in the future and be updated frequently.</p>
