        <title>Motivation</title>
        <p>Differential network inference is a fundamental and challenging problem to reveal gene interactions and regulation relationships under different conditions. Many algorithms have been developed for this problem; however, they do not consider the differences between the importance of genes, which may not fit the real-world situation. Different genes have different mutation probabilities, and the vital genes associated with basic life activities have less fault tolerance to mutation. Equally treating all genes may bias the results of differential network inference. Thus, it is necessary to consider the importance of genes in the models of differential network inference.</p>

      <sec id="s2">
        <title>Results</title>
        <p>Based on the Gaussian graphical model with adaptive gene importance regularization, we develop a novel Importance-Penalized Joint Graphical Lasso method (IPJGL) for differential network inference. The presented method is validated by the simulation experiments as well as the real datasets. Furthermore, to precisely evaluate the results of differential network inference, we propose a new metric named APC2 for the differential levels of gene pairs. We apply IPJGL to analyze the TCGA colorectal and breast cancer datasets and find some candidate cancer genes with significant survival analysis results, including SOST for colorectal cancer and RBBP8 for breast cancer. We also conduct further analysis based on the interactions in the Reactome database and confirm the utility of our method.</p>

    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>As biological data becomes more accessible, researchers are looking to extract key information from the differences in data between normal and disease samples. Although many studies analyze differences between data and extract knowledge from a single-gene perspective (<xref rid="btab751-B18" ref-type="bibr">Love <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="btab751-B22" ref-type="bibr">Robinson <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), there is still a wealth of information to be mined in the differential data. Studies have shown that the co-expression pattern between a pair of genes may have changed significantly even in the absence of significant differences in the expression levels of either one of these genes (<xref rid="btab751-B8" ref-type="bibr">de la Fuente, 2010</xref>). Therefore, it is necessary to study biological mechanism from the perspective of gene interactions. And studies have shown that biological networks differ a lot in different states, different organizations, and even at different times (<xref rid="btab751-B1" ref-type="bibr">Bandyopadhyay <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="btab751-B11" ref-type="bibr">Greene <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="btab751-B12" ref-type="bibr">Ha <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Therefore, in order to study key genes which are the root cause of diseases, we need to focus on the differential networks. In general, we focus more on the differential expression between normal samples and disease samples, i.e. given two groups of gene expression data, our problem becomes how to build a differential co-expression network to explore the key genes by differential network analysis (DiNA). However, it is not simple, because there are always numerous false positives in the network inferred by various methods. One of the reasons is that many interactions in co-expression networks result from indirect influence (<xref rid="btab751-B4" ref-type="bibr">Cecchini <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). To eliminate such indirect influence, many models have been developed. One kind of the models widely developed by researchers is the Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) because of its good property: if the entry of the precision matrix <inline-formula id="IE1"><mml:math id="IM1" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is zero, it is equivalent that variables<inline-formula id="IE2"><mml:math id="IM2" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal"> </mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula id="IE3"><mml:math id="IM3" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> are conditionally independent, i.e. there is no co-expression interactions between <inline-formula id="IE4"><mml:math id="IM4" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula id="IE5"><mml:math id="IM5" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref rid="btab751-B10" ref-type="bibr">Friedman <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Many researchers have conducted research based on the GGMs and proposed various methods to meet different assumptions.</p>
    <p>Under usual circumstances, the number of genes <inline-formula id="IE6"><mml:math id="IM6" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>≫</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, the number of samples, which results in the sample covariance matrix not being invertible. This means the precision matrix <inline-formula id="IE7"><mml:math id="IM7" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Θ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> could not be computed directly, where <inline-formula id="IE8"><mml:math id="IM8" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Σ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the real covariance matrix. Graphical Lasso (GLasso) was a popular method to estimate the precision matrix <inline-formula id="IE9"><mml:math id="IM9" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Θ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref rid="btab751-B2" ref-type="bibr">Banerjee <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="btab751-B10" ref-type="bibr">Friedman <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="btab751-B35" ref-type="bibr">Yuan and Lin, 2007</xref>). This method added the Lasso penalty term on the likelihood function to obtain a sparse solution, guiding the development of the GGMs. Subsequently, many researchers have researched the differential networks based on this model. <xref rid="btab751-B7" ref-type="bibr">Danaher <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2014)</xref> first used the differential matrix as the penalty term assuming that the networks from two groups should be similar in the overall structure despite the relatively subtle differences and hence proposed Joint Graphical Lasso (JGL). On this basis, <xref rid="btab751-B20" ref-type="bibr">Mohan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2014)</xref> proposed Perturbed-Node Joint Graphical Lasso (PNJGL) and Co-hub Node Joint Graphical Lasso (CNJGL) to solve node-based problems: the first one assumes that there are hub nodes in differential networks, and the second assumes that different states have the same hub nodes. The differential network can not only be obtained by the direct subtraction between networks of two states but can also be directly solved as a variable (<xref rid="btab751-B13" ref-type="bibr">He and Deng, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="btab751-B30" ref-type="bibr">Tang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="btab751-B31" ref-type="bibr">Tian <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="btab751-B34" ref-type="bibr">Yuan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="btab751-B36" ref-type="bibr">Zhao <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), on the premise of ensuring accuracy while greatly reducing the number of samples required.</p>
    <p>However, the above methods have a common shortcoming, i.e. they put all genes in the same position. This is not the case in the real world. Different genes have different mutation probabilities. Even the same gene has different mutation rates in different tissues and locations (<xref rid="btab751-B23" ref-type="bibr">Scally, 2016</xref>). In general, the more important genes are less likely to mutate. This is because, on the one hand, if extremely important genes mutated in an individual, such as genes that regulate essential activities of life, the individual will have a high probability of not being sampled due to rapid death. On the other hand, studies have shown that even if a mutation occurs, important genes will be repaired preferentially, i.e. one of the reasons for the different probabilities of gene mutations is the DNA repair mechanism (<xref rid="btab751-B29" ref-type="bibr">Supek and Lehner, 2015</xref>). Some methods adjust the weights of different genes (<xref rid="btab751-B19" ref-type="bibr">Lyu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="btab751-B21" ref-type="bibr">Ou-Yang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="btab751-B37" ref-type="bibr">Zuo <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). However, these methods need the prior information from the database. Once the prior information is insufficient, or the information in the database is a little biased, the results may also have certain deviations. Some method does not rely on prior information (<xref rid="btab751-B28" ref-type="bibr">Sulaimanov <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>), but it requires the time-consuming iterative generation of weights; moreover, it only considers a single state, which is not developed for inferring differential networks.</p>
    <p>To address the above issues, we proposed a novel differential network inference method to meet the hypothesis that the important genes are less likely to mutate. In this proposed model, we add an importance penalty to each gene, and the penalties vary with the solution. The genes that are significantly altered between two states will be penalized if they also have large degrees in either one of two estimated networks. The comprehensive simulation experiments proved that the proposed Importance-Penalized Joint Graphical Lasso (IPJGL) method outperforms several state-of-the-art differential network inference methods based on GGMs, on the datasets simulated under realistic and reasonable assumptions. To better evaluate the results of differential network inference, we also propose a new metric named APC2 for the differential levels of gene pairs. We further applied IPJGL to the TCGA colorectal cancer and breast cancer datasets. The networks obtained by IPJGL showed some connections within the same family, as well as those already existed in BioGRID (<xref rid="btab751-B27" ref-type="bibr">Stark <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) and Cytoscape Reactome database (<xref rid="btab751-B14" ref-type="bibr">Jassal <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="btab751-B25" ref-type="bibr">Shannon <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="btab751-B26" ref-type="bibr">Sidiropoulos <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="btab751-B33" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), which confirmed the validity of our method. Moreover, in the enrichment analysis, our method successfully obtained a gene set among about 1000 genes, which was significantly enriched in the pathway most relevant to the disease. On a deeper level, through survival analysis, we discovered a gene SOST that may be closely related to colorectal cancer. It is an inhibitor of WNT signaling (<xref rid="btab751-B32" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), and WNT signaling happens to be a signaling pathway related to multiple cancers, especially colorectal cancer (<xref rid="btab751-B5" ref-type="bibr">Clevers, 2006</xref>). Research on these genes may reveal the pathological mechanism of colorectal cancer.</p>

The vital genes are often hubs in the networks and therefore have large importance penalties. According to our assumptions, these genes are penalized to involve the differential edges between two states.</p>
      <p>In brief, IPJGL adjusts the magnitude of its second penalty term according to the importance weights <inline-formula id="IE40"><mml:math id="IM40" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced open="{" close="}" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> of genes which are adaptively updated from the estimated networks of two states. With the differentiated importance penalties, IPJGL gives more chances to reveal those less important genes involved in the differential network. <xref rid="btab751-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure  1</xref> illustrates the influence of the importance penalty using a small toy example descirbed in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>. The normalized degrees in the estimated differential network are used to represent the inferred changes of gene activity between two states. When the importance weights of genes in IPJGL are bigger than those in PNJGL, the degrees of these genes may be repressed in IPJGL, e.g. the genes 9, 5 and 10. On the contrary, when the genes have smaller importance weights in IPJGL than PNJGL, the degrees of these genes may be increased in IPJGL, e.g. the genes 1, 7, 8 and 6. Therefore, the genes involved in the differential network but with low degrees in the networks of the two states, such as gene 6, have a higher chance to be identified (<xref rid="btab751-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig.  1</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>), while these genes may be ignored by other algorithms such as PNJGL. It is worth noting that the Joint Graphical Lasso models are very complicated so that the higher or lower importance weights do not necessarily imply the repression or increase of gene activities in the differential network, respectively. For example, the degree of gene 4 is slightly increased while gene 2 totally vanishes in the result of IPJGL (<xref rid="btab751-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig.  1</xref>). If there is strong evidence from the data that a gene is significantly changed between two states, the gene still can be revealed even with high importance penalty. If the change of interactions containing a gene is small, even if the importance penalty is greatly reduced, the result of the gene will not be affected too much. Therefore, the major difference between IPJGL and other general methods is that our method pays more attention to less important genes with the significant changes between the two states.</p>

We did not use AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) as an evaluation indicator because for the sparse network inference problem, the proportion of positive edges is extremely low, so there is not much information in the comparison of AUC.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we proposed a novel metric, the absolute value of the second principal component (APC2) to conduct gene-pair survival analysis, which can test whether the interaction between a pair of genes is significantly changed for individual samples. In general survival analysis, we often consider a single gene and group samples according to its expression level. However, many diseases are unlikely to be regulated by a single gene. For example, <xref rid="btab751-B6" ref-type="bibr">Combarros <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2009)</xref> have studied Alzheimer's disease and found that there are some carriers of apolipoprotein E4 who have an increased risk of developing the disease, but not all people who carry apolipoprotein E4 will get the disease. They, therefore, identified three genes that interact with apolipoprotein E4 by studying the interactions between genes, and these interactions have impacts on Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the effect of the interaction of a pair of genes on the survival probability of patients.</p>
      <p>Specifically, APC2 is the absolute value of the second principal component based on principal component analysis.

The first principal component can be considered as the most correlated direction in all samples, and the APC2 of a sample captures its deviation from the most correlated direction (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs S22–S24</xref>). In the gene-pair survival analysis, given a pair of genes, we grouped the samples according to their APC2 values. We divided samples into two groups: half of the samples with smaller APC2 are in the group ‘high correlation’, and the other is in the group ‘low correlation’. Using gene-pair survival analysis based on APC2, we were able to identify some gene pairs that were significantly associated with patient survival time, whereas single-gene survival analysis on any of these genes alone did not yield significant results.</p>

      <p>The results of simulation experiments show that all methods have better performance when the connected rate increases from 0.1 to 0.3 (<xref rid="btab751-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig.  3</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs S20 and S21</xref>). One of the possible reasons is the changes between two states become more significant therefore easier to detect. On the other hand, the performance of all methods is more sensitive to the connected rate than the dropped rate. This is because the original network is scale-free and sparse, so the interactions to be connected are much more than those to be dropped.</p>
      <p>In all simulation experiments, IPJGL is uniformly superior to other methods (<xref rid="btab751-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig.  3</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs S20 and S21</xref>). The improvements of IPJGL over PNJGL and CNJGL are especially high when the connected rate is relatively low. This is because the changes between two states are too subtle to detect for the cases of low connected rates, while IPJGL can improve the accuracy by reducing the importance penalties of those genes with decreased degrees.</p>
      <p>The performance of IPJGL on the datasets of different modes is consistent with our assumptions. The improvements of IPJGL over PNJGL and CNJGL are largest on the datasets of diffmode 2, 3 and 5, in which none or a few mutated genes are from the group of high importance. The improvements are the smallest on the datasets of diffmode 1, in which all mutated genes are from the group of high importance.</p>

      <title>4.1 Datasets preparation</title>
      <p>Colorectal cancer and breast cancer are common and plague the normal life of many people. To explore if our method can extract some insights from real-world data, we applied IPJGL to the transcriptome profiles downloaded from the TCGA project. The datasets of HTSeq counts are used in experiments. For colorectal cancer, which belongs to adenomas and adenocarcinomas, there are a total of 39 normal samples and 398 cancer samples according to annotations. For breast cancer, which belongs to ductal and lobular neoplasms, there are a total of 112 normal samples and 1066 cancer samples according to annotations.</p>
      <p>Due to the huge number of genes, we performed the following screening. First, we selected 10 and 9 pathways related to KEGG's colorectal and breast cancer pathway including itself, which include 1034 and 958 genes, respectively. Next, we filtered out genes that did not express in at least 80% of the samples. Finally, we got 1009 and 953 genes, which are still relatively large and challenging gene sets for differential network inference problems, for colorectal and breast cancer, respectively. We used <inline-formula id="IE160"><mml:math id="IM160" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">log</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> to scale the data, and then standardize it as the final input.</p>

      <title>4.2 Comparison with single-gene-based analyses</title>
      <p>As a widely used technique, differential expression analysis (DEA) typically focuses on a single gene and then compares the difference between the two states for each gene, e.g. in expression levels. DEA is not only fast but also simple, straightforward and easy to understand, yet sometimes some genes are not significantly differentially expressed but their patterns of interacting with other genes are dramatically altered (<xref rid="btab751-B8" ref-type="bibr">de la Fuente, 2010</xref>). Fortunately, DiNA can determine which interactions between genes have produced changes, and if most interactions of some gene have changed, that gene can be considered the main factor in the changes between states. To investigate the power of DiNA, we are particularly interested in the results that were only discovered by DiNA method but not found by the traditional method of DEA.</p>
      <p>We first applied the DiNA methods with the default parameters to the real dataset to obtain the initial differential networks, and then keep the top<inline-formula id="IE161"><mml:math id="IM161" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal"> </mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> edges as the result (denoted as ‘method<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>’, e.g. the network generated by IPJGL with the top 500 edges is IPJGL500). Next, we used the ‘DESeq2’ package (<xref rid="btab751-B18" ref-type="bibr">Love <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) in R to perform DEA. The inputs to ‘DESeq2’ are the gene expression matrices in normal and disease states. The output of ‘DESeq2’, which we used, is a list of <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values for the genes. If the <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value for a gene is &lt;0.05, we consider the gene to be significantly differential in expression level between the two states. We then marked the insignificant genes (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value &gt; 0.05) with red color, which means those genes are less likely found by DEA but discovered by DiNA (<xref rid="btab751-F4" ref-type="fig">Fig.  4</xref>).</p>

      <p>To better exhibit the differential gene pairs discovered by DiNA, we used the metric APC2 as described in Section 2.3 to conduct gene-pair survival analysis on the gene pairs connected in differential networks. We downloaded the clinical data of TCGA and performed survival analysis using the R package ‘survminer’ on the single genes and the gene pairs. We fitted the data with the Kaplan–Meier model (<xref rid="btab751-B15" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan and Meier, 1958</xref>), which determines whether a difference in a factor leads to a difference in the probability of patient survival. For the single-gene survival analysis, the factor is the expression level of a gene. We divide the samples into two groups, with the gene expression levels out of the top 50% being called the high expression group and the bottom 50% being called the low expression group. For the gene-pair survival analysis, the procedure is the same except that the factor becomes the APC2 score of a gene pair. Gene-pair survival analysis can detect some genes which work together to regulate cancers, while single-gene survival analysis may ignore those genes. For example, by our proposed gene-pair survival analysis on colorectal cancer, DCC-PRKCG is significant with <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.013 while either DCC or PRKCG is not significant (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &gt; 0.05) (<xref rid="btab751-F5" ref-type="fig">Fig.  5a–c</xref>). DCC functions as a tumor suppressor and is frequently mutated or downregulated in colorectal cancer (<xref rid="btab751-B16" ref-type="bibr">Kataoka <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). In total, we get 92 significant gene pairs while 68 of them cannot be detected by single-gene survival analysis (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S6</xref>).</p>

      <title>4.3 Colorectal cancer analysis</title>
      <p>We compared IPJGL only with PNJGL for clarity of results on the real datasets because PNJGL is second only to our method in the previous simulation experiments. We kept the top 10 genes ranked by degree in method10, method50, method100, method500 (<xref rid="btab751-T2" ref-type="table">Table  2</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables S3–S5</xref>). For example, top 10 genes in method500 for colorectal cancer are shown in <xref rid="btab751-T2" ref-type="table">Table  2</xref>, where genes that cannot be found by DEA but can be discovered by DiNA are marked in bold. We integrated all bold genes in these four tables as the key genes identified by the corresponding method. IPJGL got 8 key genes: CACNG2, PTTG2, TUBA3C, HJV, PPP3R2, SOST, TBL1Y, EIF4E1B, and PNJGL got 7 key genes: TUBA3C, EIF4E1B, SPTA1, CACNG2, TBL1Y, PPP3R2, FGF22. By applying single-gene survival analysis on these genes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S25</xref>), we finally found a significant differential gene SOST (<xref rid="btab751-F5" ref-type="fig">Fig.  5d</xref>) obtained only by IPJGL, which regulates the synthesis of sclerostin (<xref rid="btab751-B9" ref-type="bibr">Delgado-Calle <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), but no direct relevant studies are suggesting its direct association with colorectal cancer. It may be a novel key gene associated with the molecular mechanisms of colorectal cancer.</p>

      <p>To explore how SOST relates to colorectal cancer, we observed the adjacent genes of SOST in IPJGL500 and found that some interactions do appear in the related literature, such as ‘SOST-WNT2’, ‘SOST-MMP7’ (<xref rid="btab751-B17" ref-type="bibr">Kusu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="btab751-B24" ref-type="bibr">Semënov <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). We further used Cytoscape's plugin ReatomeFIVz (<xref rid="btab751-B17" ref-type="bibr">Kusu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) to explore the relationship between SOST’s neighbors and colorectal cancer. A lot of evidence was found to prove the relationship between its neighbors and colorectal cancer, which further validates the correlation between SOST and colorectal cancer (Section 6.3 of <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Materials and Figs S26 and S27</xref>). We also compared the relevance of the gene sets in the differential networks obtained by different algorithms in the Reactome database. We found that genes picked by IPJGL have more interactions in Reactome than that by PNJGL when keeping the same edges as the output (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S28</xref>), which implies the gene set found by IPJGL is more closely related in the known colorectal cancer database.</p>

      <title>4.4 Breast cancer analysis</title>
      <p>We performed KEGG and GO enrichment analysis on genes in the differential networks with 50, 100 and 500 edges for breast cancer (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs S29 and S30</xref>). Because our candidate gene set is selected from the KEGG pathways, we expected that the genes obtained by the algorithm should enrich the pathways related to breast cancer. The results confirmed that the genes obtained by IPJGL have strong functional enrichment properties, and only in the genes of IPJGL500, we obtained the expected results, as shown in <xref rid="btab751-F5" ref-type="fig">Figure  5e</xref>. Although the dataset is relatively rough, the sample ratio is unbalanced, and the expression value may be biased, our method can still identify the corresponding pathway (breast cancer).</p>
      <p>Further, we followed the same data analysis procedure in previous section to obtain key genes for breast cancer. We first retained all genes in the differential network method500 with <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value &gt;0.05 in DESeq2. Then we performed the survival analysis for these genes to obtain the final set of key genes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S31</xref>). Among them, there are 5 key genes obtained by IPJGL: SFRP5, FGF19, HES5, IL7R, RBBP8, and 3 key genes obtained by PNJGL: SFRP5, FGF19, HES5. The unique key gene RBBP8 identified by IPJGL is also called CTIP, whose low-level expression is associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer (<xref rid="btab751-B32" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), as shown in our survival analysis (<xref rid="btab751-F5" ref-type="fig">Fig.  5f</xref>).</p>

    <title>5 Conclusion</title>
    <p>In this article, we developed a novel algorithm IPJGL for differential network inference by adding an importance regularization term in the GGM. The comprehensive simulation experiments of comparing the proposed method with several state-of-the-art differential network inference methods based on GGMs confirmed the advantages and validity of the new algorithm. We also clarified the difference between DiNA and DEA in that DEA focuses on individual genes, whereas DiNA focuses on gene interactions, which are more complex but can also reveal more information. For this purpose, we proposed a novel metric APC2 for evaluating the interaction between a pair of genes for individual samples, which can be used in the downstream analyses of DiNA such as the gene-pair survival analysis. Finally, by applying the new method on the TCGA datasets, we obtained some significant cancer genes, such as SOST and RBBP8 for colorectal cancer and breast cancer, respectively, and found a lot of evidence related to cancers. In a nutshell, we hope our algorithm, simulation studies, and gene-pair interaction measurement can help biological and medical researchers find more candidate key genes about various kinds of cancers, while there is still a lot of work that needs to do based on the assumption of gene importance.</p>
