    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>Highly accurate and contiguous phased diploid <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assemblies of long-read sequencing data have made reference-grade assemblies feasible for many species and individuals (<xref rid="btac714-B3" ref-type="bibr">Ebert <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="btac714-B15" ref-type="bibr">Rhie <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). Pacific Biosciences high-fidelity (HiFi) sequencing in particular has facilitated some of the first complete assembly of centromeres, acrocentric regions, as well as other complex segmental duplications (<xref rid="btac714-B9" ref-type="bibr">Logsdon <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="btac714-B11" ref-type="bibr">Miga <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="btac714-B14" ref-type="bibr">Nurk <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). These assemblies make possible comprehensive, whole-genome evaluations of sequence variation, including some of the most difficult-to-assemble regions, unbiased by reference alignments for the first time. Phased genome assemblies, however, are still subject to the collapse of repetitive sequences, incorrect orientations and misassemblies. Thus, any discoveries based on these automated shotgun sequence assemblies raise the question of whether the assembled sequence is, in fact, valid.</p>
    <p>Here, we present genome assembly validation via inter-singly unique nucleotide <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-mer (SUNK) distances in Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) reads, known hereafter as GAVISUNK. GAVISUNK is a method of validating phased diploid HiFi-driven assemblies with orthogonal ONT sequence. It specifically assesses the contiguity of regions, flagging potential haplotype switches or misassemblies. Although the ONT platform has a significantly higher error rate than that of HiFi (<xref rid="btac714-B8" ref-type="bibr">Logsdon <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>), such reads are typically much longer, making it a powerful orthogonal approach for assessing both contiguity and read depth across regions of interest. Whereas previous genome blacklists or masks of inaccessible regions, such as those used by the ENCODE Consortium, are determined based on annotation of a reference genome (<xref rid="btac714-B1" ref-type="bibr">Amemiya <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>), GAVISUNK may be applied to any region or genome assembly to identify misassemblies and potential collapses and is, thus, particularly valuable for validating the integrity of regions with large and highly identical repeats that are more prone to assembly error. This method can be applied genome-wide or at fine scale to closely examine regions of interest across multiple haplotype assemblies.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec>
    <title>2 Materials and methods</title>
    <p>This assembly validation method relies on identifying SUNKs, <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-mers that occur just a single time within the HiFi-based assembly (<xref rid="btac714-B16" ref-type="bibr">Sudmant <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>) and confirming these SUNKs within long ONT sequencing reads. Because of the relatively lower accuracy of ONT data, false SUNK overlaps may occur at an appreciable frequency between paralogous regions of the genome or haplotypes. Therefore, we leverage not only the presence or absence of SUNKs, but also the intervening distance between pairs of SUNKs, referred to hereafter as inter-SUNK distances. The approach then compares the expected inter-SUNK distance in the assembly and observed distance within ONT reads to recruit reads to their corresponding genomic location. The failure of ONT reads to span between SUNKs in the assembly defines a misjoin, while an excess of reads flags a potential collapse.</p>
    <p>We apply Jellyfish (<xref rid="btac714-B10" ref-type="bibr">Marçais and Kingsford, 2011</xref>) to identify unique <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-mers based on all HiFi contigs within an assembly, generating a set of SUNKs for validation. ONT reads are haplotype phased using parental Illumina whole-genome sequencing data via Canu (<xref rid="btac714-B7" ref-type="bibr">Koren <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), or, in the absence of parental data, with Hi-C and HapCUT2 (<xref rid="btac714-B4" ref-type="bibr">Edge <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). The position of all SUNKs within each ONT read are identified and used for downstream analysis. Each ONT read is assigned to its best-matching HiFi-assembled contig and orientation by comparing the locations of read SUNKs to assembly SUNKs within a diagonal band centered on the median SUNK location for that read. SUNKs observed in ONT reads at an implausibly high or low frequency (i.e. greater than four standard deviations above the mean or fewer than twice) for either haplotype are excluded from consideration.</p>
    <p>To validate the assembly of each HiFi contig, all reads identified in the previous step are considered. For each read, a matrix of all pairwise inter-SUNK distances within the read is generated using NumPy and compared to expected distances from the assembly, allowing ±2% variation in length for a given distance by default (<xref rid="btac714-B5" ref-type="bibr">Harris <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). Only the largest set of SUNKs with fully inter-consistent inter-SUNK distances are retained from each read for subsequent validation. In this way, chimeric reads and other spuriously connected SUNKs are separated. A graph is generated for each contig, with SUNKs as nodes and reads as edges, connecting pairs of SUNKs with consistent inter-SUNK distances, using the graph-tool library. This graph is decomposed into its connected components, each of which now corresponds to a validated region of the contig, identifying SUNKs spanned by ONT reads. These validated regions are sent as output to a BED file, and assembly SUNKs with no read support are listed as potentially artifactual.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec>
    <title>3 Usage and examples</title>
    <p>GAVISUNK can run on consumer hardware, research clusters, or in cloud computing environments, as its steps are automated as part of a configurable Snakemake workflow (<xref rid="btac714-B13" ref-type="bibr">Mölder <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). To install GAVISUNK, clone <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/pdishuck/GAVISUNK" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/pdishuck/GAVISUNK</ext-link>. Upon first run, dependencies will install automatically as a conda environment.</p>
    <p>As described in the README, two configuration files must be edited to specify the assembly and <italic toggle="yes">k-</italic>mer size (<monospace>config.yaml</monospace>) and input nanopore read files (<monospace>ont.tsv</monospace>). To execute the pipeline, submit<disp-quote content-type="extract"><p><monospace>snakemake –use-conda –cores {thread.count}</monospace></p></disp-quote></p>
    <p>By default, the pipeline produces a BED file of validated regions (<monospace>hap#.validated.bed</monospace>) and the complementary unconfirmed ‘gaps’ between validated regions (<monospace>hap#.gaps.bed</monospace>) for each haplotype of the assembly. For the region of each validation gap, the pipeline produces a visualization to show SUNK-tagged read support, in PDF, SVG and PNG formats (<monospace>contig_start_end.format</monospace>), as shown in <xref rid="btac714-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>. Optionally, a BED file with regions of interest for visualization can be specified for each haplotype in <monospace>ont.tsv</monospace>.</p>

        <p>Example detected misassembly (HG02723 paternal haplotype) within the amylase duplication locus. This assembly contains a false deletion of AMY1B and AMY1A, which is confirmed by the failure of ONT to anchor across the misjoin. Each ONT read is represented by a horizontal bar: the thick gray region contains valid inter-SUNK distances, while the remainder of the read is thinner cyan. Concordant SUNK matches are full-width black tick marks, while discordant matches are small red tick marks. All possible assembly SUNKs are shown as dotted vertical lines in the background, and a DupMasker track marks segmental duplications above. The horizontal dotted blue line indicates the mean genome-wide coverage of ONT sequencing data (A color version of this figure appears in the online version of this article)</p>

      <graphic xlink:href="btac714f1" position="float"/>
    </fig>
    <p>To annotate the visualizations, BED files encoding regions of interest and color may be supplied. In the example shown in <xref rid="btac714-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, DupMasker annotations demarcate segmental duplications across the locus (<xref rid="btac714-B6" ref-type="bibr">Jiang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In addition, the sizes of unspanned inter-SUNK gaps are output for comparison with the distribution of inter-SUNK distances and expectation of spanning that distance given empirical ONT coverage at that read length (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). Highly identical loci may have insufficient SUNK density for validation with this method, given current ONT read lengths (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>).</p>
    <p>We constructed a pseudo-diploid genome assembly as a benchmark of false discovery rate for a well-curated reference assembly with matched ultra-long ONT data. We used the long-read assemblies of the CHM13 and CHM1 human cell lines, both of which are derived from complete hydatidiform moles exhibiting genome-wide uniparental disomy and are therefore guaranteed to represent a single haplotype. CHM13 was assembled by the T2T Consortium with a variety of methods and manual validation (<xref rid="btac714-B14" ref-type="bibr">Nurk <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>), and CHM1 was assembled from HiFi data [<xref rid="btac714-B17" ref-type="bibr">Vollger <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>, using hifiasm v0.12 (<xref rid="btac714-B2" ref-type="bibr">Cheng <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>)], each with &gt;30× coverage of ONT reads longer than 100 kbp. Results for this pseudo-diploid, along with true diploid HG02723 (hifiasm v0.14), are summarized in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>, with detailed results for CHM13-T2T validation gaps in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>.</p>
    <p>Other assembly validation methods TandemTools and VerityMap (<xref rid="btac714-B12" ref-type="bibr">Mikheenko <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>) also used rare k-mers for validation but have distinct goals to GAVISUNK. Both are intended for use on extra-long tandem repeats and developed to use HiFi to validate haploid assemblies. GAVISUNK uses ultra-long ONT data genome-wide to validate diploid assemblies, focused on long interspersed repeats such as segmental duplications.</p>
    <p>For CHM13, 1.0% of the assembled genome (103 gaps, 31.7 Mbp) is unsupported by ONT inter-SUNK distances, and 0.7% (274 gaps, 23.9 Mbp) for CHM1. For comparison, assuming random distribution of the empirical ONT read lengths compared to the distances between SUNKs for the CHM13 assembly, 24.9 Mbp is expected to be unsupported (92 gaps, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>). Extra-long tandem repeats are difficult to validate with this method, particularly the qh regions of chromosomes 1, 9 and 16, with 73 of 103 CHM13 validation gaps falling in the region. An optional ‘2pass’ mode performs a second pass of analysis on putative validation gaps with more-permissive read recruitment and validates the higher-order repeats of 21/23 CHM13 centromeres (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S3</xref>).</p>

    <title>4 Conclusion</title>
    <p>We developed GAVISUNK, a method for assembly validation using inter-SUNK distances in ONT reads. Applied to HiFi genome assemblies, this tool provides orthogonal validation of regions for downstream analysis, allowing for subsequent genome analyses and annotation. GAVISUNK provides easily interoperable BED outputs and interpretable visualizations of supported and unsupported regions of interest.</p>
