      <title>ABSTRACT</title>
      <p>Sequencing of bacterial genomes using Illumina technology has become such a standard procedure that often data are generated faster than can be conveniently analyzed. We created a new series of pipelines called Bactopia, built using Nextflow workflow software, to provide efficient comparative genomic analyses for bacterial species or genera. Bactopia consists of a data set setup step (Bactopia Data Sets [BaDs]), which creates a series of customizable data sets for the species of interest, the Bactopia Analysis Pipeline (BaAP), which performs quality control, genome assembly, and several other functions based on the available data sets and outputs the processed data to a structured directory format, and a series of Bactopia Tools (BaTs) that perform specific postprocessing on some or all of the processed data. BaTs include pan-genome analysis, computing average nucleotide identity between samples, extracting and profiling the 16S genes, and taxonomic classification using highly conserved genes. It is expected that the number of BaTs will increase to fill specific applications in the future. As a demonstration, we performed an analysis of 1,664 public <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> genomes, focusing on <named-content content-type="genus-species">Lactobacillus crispatus</named-content>, a species that is a common part of the human vaginal microbiome. Bactopia is an open source system that can scale from projects as small as one bacterial genome to ones including thousands of genomes and that allows for great flexibility in choosing comparison data sets and options for downstream analysis. Bactopia code can be accessed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.github.com/bactopia/bactopia">https://www.github.com/bactopia/bactopia</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Sequencing a bacterial genome, an activity that once required the infrastructure of a dedicated genome center, is now a routine task that even a small laboratory can undertake. Many open-source software tools have been created to handle various parts of the process of using raw read data for functions such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling and <italic>de novo</italic> assembly. As a result of dedicated community efforts, it has recently become much easier to locally install these bioinformatic tools through package managers (Bioconda [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and Brew [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]) or through the use of software containers (Docker and Singularity). Despite these advances, producers of bacterial sequence data face a bewildering array of choices when considering how to perform analysis, particularly when large numbers of genomes are involved and processing efficiency and scalability become major factors.</p>
    <p>Efficient bacterial multigenome analysis has been hampered by three missing functionalities. First is the need to have workflows of workflows' that can integrate analyses and provide a simplified way to start with a collection of raw genome data, remove low-quality sequences, and perform the basic analytic steps of <italic>de novo</italic> assembly, mapping to reference sequence, and taxonomic assignment. Second is the desire to incorporate user-specific knowledge of the species into the input of the main genome analysis pipeline. While many microbiologists are not expert bioinformaticians, they are experts in the organisms they study. Third is the need to create an output format from the main pipeline that could be used for future customized downstream analysis such as pan-genome analysis and basic visualization of phylogenies.</p>
    <p>Here, we introduce Bactopia, an integrated suite of workflows primarily designed for flexible analysis of Illumina genome sequencing projects of bacteria from the same taxon. Bactopia is based on Nextflow workflow software (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and is designed to be scalable, allowing projects as small as a single genome to be run on a local desktop or projects including many thousands of genomes to be run as a batch on a cloud infrastructure. Running multiple tasks on a single platform standardizes the underlying data quality used for gene and variant calling between projects run in different laboratories. This structure also simplifies the user experience. In Bactopia, complex multigenome analysis can be run in a small number of commands. However, there are myriad options for fine-tuning data sets used for analysis and the functions of the system. The underlying Nextflow structure ensures reproducibility. To illustrate the functionality of the system, we performed a Bactopia analysis of 1,664 public genome samples of the <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> genus, an important component of the microbiome of humans and animals.</p>

      <title>Design and implementation.</title>
      <p>Bactopia links together open-source bioinformatics software, available from Bioconda (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), using Nextflow (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Nextflow was chosen for its flexibility: Bactopia can be run locally, on clusters, or on cloud platforms with simple parameter changes. It also manages the parallel execution of tasks and creates checkpoints allowing users to resume jobs. Nextflow automates installation of the component software of the workflow through integration with Bioconda. For ease of deployment, Bactopia can be installed either through Bioconda, a Docker container, or a Singularity container. All of the software programs used by Bactopia (version 1.4.0) described in the manuscript are listed in <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> with their individual version numbers.</p>

      <p>There are three main components of Bactopia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig. S1</xref> in the supplemental material). Bactopia Data Sets (BaDs) is a framework for formatting organism-specific data sets to be used by the downstream analysis pipeline. The Bactopia Analysis Pipeline (BaAP) is a customizable workflow for the analysis of individual bacterial genome projects that is an extension and generalization of the previously published <named-content content-type="genus-species">Staphylococcus aureus</named-content>-specific Staphopia Analysis Pipeline (StAP) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The inputs to BaAP are FASTQ files from bacterial Illumina sequencing projects, either imported from the National Centers for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Short Read Archive (SRA) database or provided locally, and any reference data in the BaDs. Bactopia Tools (BaTs) is a set of workflows that use the output files from a BaAP project to run genomic analysis on multiple genomes. For this project we used BaTs to (i) summarize the results of running multiple bacterial genomes through BaAP, (ii) extract 16S gene sequences and create a phylogeny, (iii) assign taxonomic classifications with the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), (iv) determine subsets of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Lactobacillus crispatus</named-content> samples by average nucleotide identity (ANI) with FastANI (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), and (v) run pan-genome analysis for <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. crispatus</named-content> using Roary (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and create a core-genome phylogeny.</p>

      <title>Comparison to similar open-source software.</title>
      <p>At the time of writing (February 2020), we knew of only three other actively maintained open-source generalist bacterial genomic workflow software programs that encompassed a similar range of functionality to Bactopia: ASA<sup>3</sup>P (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), TORMES (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and the currently unpublished Nullarbor (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The versions of these programs used many of the same component software programs (e.g., Prokka, SPAdes, BLAST+, and Roary) but differed in the philosophies underlying their design (<xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This made head-to-head runtime comparisons somewhat meaningless as each was aimed at a different analysis scenario and produced a different output. Bactopia was the most open-ended and flexible, allowing the user to customize input databases and providing a platform for downstream analysis by different BaTs rather than built-in pangenome and phylogeny creation. Bactopia also had some features not implemented in the other programs, such as SRA/ENA search and download and automated reference genome selection for identifying variants. Both Bactopia and ASA<sup>3</sup>P are highly scalable, and each can be seamlessly executed on local, cluster, and cloud environments with little effort required by the user. ASA<sup>3</sup>P was the only program to implement long-read assembly of multiple projects. TORMES was the only program to include a user-customizable RMarkdown for reporting and to have optional analyses specifically for <italic>Escherichia</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Nullarbor was the only program to implement a prescreening method for filtering out potential biological outliers prior to full analysis.</p>

      <title>Use case: the <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> genus.</title>
      <p>We performed a Bactopia analysis of publicly available raw Illumina data labeled as belonging to the <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> genus. <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> is an important component of the human microbiome, and cultured samples have been sequenced by several research groups over the past few years. <named-content content-type="genus-species">Lactobacillus crispatus</named-content> and other species are often the majority bacterial genus of the human vagina and are associated with low pH and reduction in pathogen burden (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Samples of the genus are used in the food industry for fermentation in the production of yoghurt, kimchi, kombucha, and other common items. <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> is a common probiotic although recent genome-based transmission studies showed that bloodstream infections can follow after ingestion by immunocompromised patients (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p>
      <p>In November 2019, we initiated Bactopia analysis using the following three commands:</p>
      <p>
        <inline-graphic xlink:href="mSystems.00190-20-m0001.jpg"/>
      </p>
      <p>The “bactopia datasets” subcommand automated downloading of BaDs. With these parameters, we downloaded and formatted the following data sets: Ariba (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) reference databases for the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) and the core Virulence Factor Database (VFDB) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), RefSeq Mash sketch (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), GenBank Sourmash signatures (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), PLSDB BLAST database and Mash sketch (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), and a clustered protein set and Mash sketch from completed <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> genomes (<inline-graphic xlink:href="mSystems.00190-20-m0002.jpg"/>) available from NCBI Assembly (RefSeq). This took 25 min to complete.</p>
      <p>The “bactopia search” subcommand produced a list of accession numbers for 2,030 experiments that had been labeled as “<italic>Lactobacillus</italic>” (taxonomy identifier [taxon ID]: 1578) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataS1">Data Set S1</xref>). After filtering for only Illumina sequencing, 1,664 accession numbers for experiments remained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataS2">Data Set S2</xref>).</p>

      <p>The main “bactopia” command automated BaAP processing of the list of accessions (<inline-graphic xlink:href="mSystems.00190-20-m0003.jpg"/>) using the downloaded BaTs (<inline-graphic xlink:href="mSystems.00190-20-m0004.jpg"/>). Here, we chose a standard maximum coverage per genome of 100× (<inline-graphic xlink:href="mSystems.00190-20-m0005.jpg"/>), based on the estimated genome size. We used the range of genome sizes (1.2 Mb to 3.7 Mb) for the completed <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> genomes to require that the estimated genome size for each sample be between 1 Mbp (<inline-graphic xlink:href="mSystems.00190-20-m0006.jpg"/>) and 4.2 Mbp (<inline-graphic xlink:href="mSystems.00190-20-m0007.jpg"/>).</p>
      <p>Samples were processed on a 96-core SLURM cluster with 512 GB of available RAM. Analysis took approximately 2.5 days to complete, with an estimated runtime of 30 min per sample (determined by adding up the median process runtime, for 17 different processes in total, in BaAP). No individual process used more than 8 GB of memory, with all but five using less than 1 GB. Nextflow (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) recorded detailed statistics on resource usage, including CPU, memory, job duration, and input-output (I/O).

      <title>Analysis of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> genomes using BaTs.</title>
      <p>The BaAP outputted a directory of directories named after the unique experiment accession number for each sample. Within each sample directory were subdirectories for the output of each analysis run. These data structures were recognized by BaTs for subsequent analysis.</p>
      <p>We used BaT “summary” to generate a summary report of our analysis. The report includes an overview of sequence quality, assembly statistics, and predicted antimicrobial resistances and virulence factors. It also outputs a list of samples that fail to meet minimum sequencing depth and/or quality thresholds.</p>
      <p>
        <inline-graphic xlink:href="mSystems.00190-20-m0008.jpg"/>
      </p>
      <p>BaT “summary” grouped samples as gold, silver, bronze, exclude, or unprocessed, based on BaAP completion, minimum sequencing coverage, per-read sequencing mean quality, minimum mean read length, and assembly quality (<xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig. S2</xref>). To be placed in a group, a sample had to meet each cutoff. Cutoffs were based on those used by the Staphopia Analysis Pipeline (StAP) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) with the addition of a contig count cutoff. For this analysis we used the default values for these cutoffs to group our samples. Gold samples were defined as those having greater than 100× coverage, per-read mean quality greater than Q30, mean read length greater than 95 bp, and an assembly with fewer than 100 contigs. Silver samples were defined as those having greater than 50× coverage, per-read mean quality greater than Q20, mean read length greater than 75 bp, and an assembly with less than 200 contigs. Bronze samples were defined as those having greater than 20× coverage, per-read mean quality greater than Q12, mean read length greater than 49 bp, and an assembly with fewer than 500 contigs. A total of 106 samples (the exclude and unprocessed groups) were excluded from further analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table S1</xref>). Forty-eight samples that failed to meet the minimum thresholds for bronze quality were assigned to the exclude group. Fifty-eight samples that were not processed by BaAP due to sequencing-related errors or because of the estimated genome sizes were grouped as unprocessed. Of these, one (SRA accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX4526092" assigning-authority="ncbi:sra">SRX4526092</ext-link>) was labeled as paired end but did not have both sets of reads, one (SRA accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX1490246" assigning-authority="ncbi:sra">SRX1490246</ext-link>) was identified to be an assembly converted to FASTQ format, and 14 had insufficient sequencing depth. The remaining 42 samples, unprocessed by BaAP, had an estimated genome size which exceeded 4.2 Mbp (set at runtime). We queried these samples against available GenBank and RefSeq sketches using Mash screen and Sourmash lca gather. There were 36 samples that contained evidence for <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> but also sequences for other bacterial species, phage, virus, and plant genomes. There were six samples that contained no evidence for <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, four of which had matches to multiple bacterial species, and two of which had matches only to <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content>.</p>

        <p>Sequencing quality ranks per year from 2011 to 2019 of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> genome projects. Genome projects were grouped into three ranks of increasing quality: bronze, silver, and gold. The rank was based on coverage, read length, per-read quality, and total assembled contigs. The highest rank, gold, represented 62% (<italic>n</italic> = 967) of the available <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> genome projects. Of the remaining genomes, 25% (<italic>n</italic> = 386) were ranked silver, and 13% (<italic>n</italic> = 205) were ranked bronze. Between the years of 2011 and 2019, gold-ranked samples consistently outnumbered silver- and bronze-ranked sampled except for the years 2011 and 2015. However, it is likely that the total number of gold-ranked samples is underrepresented due coverage reduction being based on the estimated genome size.

      <p>There were 1,558 samples with gold, silver, or bronze quality (<xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) that were used for further analysis. For these we found that, on average, the assembled genome size was about 12% smaller than the estimated genome size (<xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig. S3</xref>). If we assume that the assembled genome size is a better indicator of a sample’s genome size, the average coverage before quality control (QC) increased from 220× to 268×. In this use case, the <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> genus, it was necessary to estimate genome sizes, but in dealing with samples from a single species, it may be better to provide a known genome size.</p>

      <p>For visualization of the phylogenetic relationships of the samples, we used the “phyloflash” and “gtdb” BaTs.</p>
      <p>
        <inline-graphic xlink:href="mSystems.00190-20-m0009.jpg"/>
      </p>
      <p>The “gtdb” BaT used GTDB-Tk (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) to assign a taxonomic classification to each sample. GTDB-Tk used the assembly to predict genes with Prodigal (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), identify GTDB marker genes (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) (<inline-graphic xlink:href="mSystems.00190-20-m0010.jpg"/>) for phylogenetic inference with HMMER3 (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and find the maximum-likelihood placement of each sample on the GTDB-Tk reference tree with pplacer (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). A taxonomic classification was assigned to 1,554 samples, and 4 samples failed classification due to insufficient marker gene coverage or marker genes with multiple hits.</p>
      <p>The “phyloflash” BaT used the phyloFlash tool (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) to reconstruct a 16S rRNA gene from each sample that was used for phylogenetic reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). Samples that failed to meet quality cutoffs were excluded from this analysis (<inline-graphic xlink:href="mSystems.00190-20-m0011.jpg"/>). The 16S rRNA was reconstructed from a SPAdes (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) assembly and annotated against the SILVA (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) rRNA database (<inline-graphic xlink:href="mSystems.00190-20-m0012.jpg"/>) for 1,470 samples. There were 88 samples that were excluded from the phylogeny: 12 samples that did not meet the requirement of a mean read length of 50 bp, 17 samples in which a 16S gene could not be reconstructed, 19 samples that had a mismatch in assembly and mapped-read taxon designations, and 40 samples that had 16S genes reconstructed for multiple species. A phylogenetic tree was created with IQ-TREE (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">–</xref><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) based on a multiple-sequence alignment of the reconstructed 16S genes with MAFFT (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Taxonomic classifications from GTDB-Tk were used to annotate the 16S genes with iTOL (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p>

      <p>A recent analysis of completed genomes in the NCBI found 239 discontinuous <italic>de novo Lactobacillus</italic> species using a 94% ANI cutoff (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Based on GTDB taxonomic classification, which applies a 95% ANI cutoff, we identified 161 distinct <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species in 1,554 samples. The five most sequenced <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species, accounting for 45% of the total, were <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. rhamnosus</named-content> (<italic>n</italic> = 225), <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. paracasei</named-content> (<italic>n</italic> = 180), <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. gasseri</named-content> (<italic>n</italic> = 132), <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. plantarum</named-content> (<italic>n</italic> = 86), and <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. fermentum</named-content> (<italic>n</italic> = 80).

      <p>We found that 505 (∼33%) of 1,554 taxonomic classifications by 16S gene and GTDB were in conflict with the taxonomy according to the NCBI SRA, illustrating the importance of an unbiased approach to understanding sample context. In samples that had both a 16S and GTDB taxonomic classification, there was disagreement in 154 out of 1,467 samples. Of these, 47% were accounted for by the recently described <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. paragasseri</named-content> (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) (<italic>n</italic> = 72). This possibly highlights a lag in the reclassification of assemblies in the NCBI Assembly database.</p>
      <p>Analysis of the pangenome of the entire genus using a tool such as Roary (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) would return only a few core genes, owing to sequence divergence of evolutionarily distant species. However, because the “roary” BaT can be supplied with a list of individual samples, it is possible to isolate the analysis to the species level. As an example of using BaTs to focus on a particular group within the larger set of results, we chose <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. crispatus</named-content>, a species commonly isolated from the human vagina and also found in the guts/feces of poultry.</p>

        <inline-graphic xlink:href="mSystems.00190-20-m0013.jpg"/>

      <p>We used the “fastani” BaT to estimate the ANI of all samples against a single (<inline-graphic xlink:href="mSystems.00190-20-m0014.jpg"/>) randomly selected <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. crispatus</named-content> completed genome (NCBI Assembly accession no. GCF_003795065; <inline-graphic xlink:href="mSystems.00190-20-m0015.jpg"/>) with FastANI (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). A cutoff of greater than 95% ANI was used to categorize a sample as <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. crispatus</named-content>. A pan-genome analysis was conducted on only the samples categorized as <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. crispatus</named-content> (<inline-graphic xlink:href="mSystems.00190-20-m0016.jpg"/>) using the “roary” BaT. The “roary” BaT downloaded all available completed <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. crispatus</named-content> genomes with ncbi-genome-download (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), formatted the completed genomes with Prokka (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), created a pan-genome and core-genome alignment (<inline-graphic xlink:href="mSystems.00190-20-m0017.jpg"/>) with Roary (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), identified and masked recombination with ClonalFrameML (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) and maskrc-svg (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), and created a phylogenetic tree with IQ-TREE (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">–</xref><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and a pairwise SNP distance matrix with snp-dists (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p>
      <p>ANI analysis revealed 38 samples as having &gt;96.1% ANI to <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. crispatus</named-content>, with no other sample greater than 83.1%. Four completed <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. crispatus</named-content> genomes were also included in the analysis (<xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), for a total of 42 genomes. The pan-genome of <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. crispatus</named-content> was revealed to have 7,037 gene families and 972 core genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). Similar to a recent analysis by Pan et al. (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. crispatus</named-content> was separated into two main phylogenetic groups, one associated with human vaginal isolates and the other having more mixed provenance and including chicken, turkey, and human gut isolates.</p>

      <p>Last, we looked at patterns of antibiotic resistance across the genus using a table, generated by the “summary” BaT, of resistance genes and loci called by AMRFinder+ (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Only 79 out of 1,496 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> samples defined by GTDB-Tk (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) were found to have predicted resistance using AMRFinder+. The most common resistance categories were tetracyclines (67 samples), followed by macrolides, lincosamides, and aminoglycosides (16, 15, and 11 samples, respectively). Species with the highest proportion of resistance included <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. amylovorus</named-content> (12/14 tetracycline resistant) and <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. crispatus</named-content> (10/42 tetracycline resistant). Only three genomes of <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. amylophilus</named-content> were included in the study, but each contained matches to genes for macrolide, lincosamide, and tetracycline resistance. The linking thread between these species is that they are each commonly isolated from agricultural animals. The high proportion of <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. crispatus</named-content> samples isolated from chickens that were tetracycline resistant has been previously observed (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
      <p>A recent analysis of 184 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> type strain genomes by Campedelli et al. (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) found a higher percentage of type strains with aminoglycoside (20/184), tetracycline (18/184), erythromycin (6/184), and clindamycin (60/184) resistance. Forty-two of the type strains had chloramphenicol resistance genes whereas, here, AMRFinder+ returned only 1/1,467 genes. These differences probably reflect a combination of the different sampling biases of the studies and the strategy of Campedelli et al. to use a relaxed threshold for hits to maximize sensitivity (blastp matches against the CARD database with acid sequence identity of 30% and query coverage of 70% [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]). Resistance is probably undercalled by both methods because of a lack of well-characterized resistance loci from the <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> genus to use for comparison.</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>Bactopia is a flexible workflow for bacterial genomics. It can be run on a laptop for a single bacterial sample, but, critically, the underlying Nextflow framework allows it to make efficient use of large clusters and cloud-computing environments to process the many thousands of genomes that are currently being generated. For users that are not familiar with bacterial genomic tools and/or who require a standardized pipeline, Bactopia is a one-stop shop that can be easily deployed using conda, Docker, and Singularity containers. For researchers with particular interest in individual species or genera, BaDs can be highly customized with taxon-specific databases.</p>
    <p>The current version of Bactopia has only minimal support for long-read data, but this is an area that we plan to expand in the future. We also plan to implement more comparative analyses in the form of additional BaTs. With a framework set in place for developing BaTs, it should be possible to make a toolbox of workflows that not only can be used for all bacteria but are also customized for annotating genes and loci specific for particular species.</p>

    <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
    <sec id="s4.1">
      <title>Bactopia Data Sets.</title>
      <p>The Bactopia pipeline can be run without downloading and formatting Bactopia Data Sets (BaDs). However, providing them enriches the downstream analysis. Bactopia can import specific existing public data sets, as well as accessible user-provided data sets in the appropriate format. A subcommand (“bactopia datasets”) was created to automate downloading, building, and (or) configuring these data sets for Bactopia.</p>
      <p>BaDs can be grouped into those that are general and those that are user supplied. General data sets include a Mash (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) sketch of the NCBI RefSeq (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and PLSDB (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) databases and a Sourmash (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) signature of microbial genomes (including viral and fungal) from the NCBI GenBank (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) database. Ariba (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), a software program for detecting genes in raw read (FASTQ) files, uses a number of default reference databases for virulence and antibiotic resistance. The available Ariba data sets include ARG-ANNOT (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), CARD (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), MEGARes (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), NCBI Reference Gene Catalog (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), plasmidfinder (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), resfinder (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), SRST2 (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), VFDB (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and VirulenceFinder (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>).</p>
      <p>When an organism name is provided, additional data sets are set up. If a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) schema is available for the species, it is downloaded from PubMLST.org (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) and set up for BLAST+ (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) and Ariba. Each RefSeq completed genome for the species is downloaded using ncbi-genome-download (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). A Mash sketch is created from the set of downloaded completed genomes to be used for automatic reference selection for variant calling. Protein sequences are extracted from each genome with BioPython (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>), clustered using CD-HIT (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), and formatted to be used by Prokka (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) for annotation. Users may also provide their own organism-specific reference data sets to be used for BLAST+ alignment, short-read alignment, or variant calling.</p>

    <sec id="s4.2">
      <title>Bactopia Analysis Pipeline.</title>
      <p>The Bactopia Analysis Pipeline (BaAP) takes input FASTQ or preassembled genomes as FASTA files and optional user-specified BaDs and performs a number of workflows that are based on either <italic>de novo</italic> whole-genome assembly, reference mapping, or sequence decomposition (i.e., <italic>k</italic>-mer-based approaches) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b</xref>). BaAP has incorporated numerous existing bioinformatic tools (<xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) into its workflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig. S1</xref> in the supplemental material). For each tool, many of the input parameters are exposed to the user, allowing for fine-tuning analysis.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s4.3">
      <title>BaAP: acquiring FASTQs.</title>
      <p>Bactopia provides multiple ways for users to provide their FASTQ-formatted sequences. Input FASTQs can be local or downloaded from public repositories or preassembled genomes as FASTA files. There is also an option for hybrid assembly of Illumina and long-read data.</p>
      <p>Local sequences can be processed one at a time or in batches. To process a single sample, the user provides the path to the FASTQ(s) and a sample name. For multiple samples, this method does not make efficient use of Nextflow’s queue system. Alternatively, users can provide a “file of filenames” (FOFN), which is a tab-delimited file with information about samples and paths to the corresponding FASTQ(s). By using the FOFN method, Nextflow queues each sample and makes efficient use of available resources. A subcommand (“bactopia prepare”) was created to automate the creation of an FOFN.</p>
      <p>Raw sequences available from public repositories (e.g., European Nucleotide Archive [ENA], Sequence Read Archive [SRA], DNA Data Bank of Japan [DDBJ], or NCBI Assembly) can also be processed by Bactopia. Sequences associated with a provided experiment accession number (e.g., DRX, ERX, or SRX prefix) or NCBI Assembly accession number (e.g., GCF or GCA prefix) are downloaded and processed exactly as local sequences would be. A subcommand (“bactopia search”) was created which allows users to query ENA to create a list of experiment accession numbers from the ENA Data Warehouse API (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>) associated with a BioProject accession number, taxon ID, or organism name.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s4.4">
      <title>BaAP: validating FASTQs.</title>
      <p>The path for input FASTQ(s) is validated, and, if necessary, sequences from public repositories are downloaded using fastq-dl (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). If a preassembled genome is provided as an input, 2- by 250-bp paired-end reads are simulated using ART (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Once validated, the FASTQ input(s) is tested to determine if it meets a minimum threshold for continued processing. All BaAP steps expect to use Illumina sequence data, which represent the great majority of genome projects currently generated. FASTQ files that are explicitly marked as non-Illumina or have properties that suggest that they are non-Illumina (e.g., read length or error profile) are excluded. By default, input FASTQs must exceed 2,241,820 bases (20× coverage of the smallest bacterial genome, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Nasuia deltocephalinicola</named-content> [<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]) and 7,472 reads (minimum required base pairs/300 bp, the longest available reads from Illumina). If estimated, the genome size must be between 100,000 bp and 18,040,666 bp, which is based on the range of known bacterial genome sizes (<named-content content-type="genus-species">N. deltocephalinicola</named-content>, NCBI accession no. GCF_000442605, 112,091 bp<italic>;</italic>
<named-content content-type="genus-species">Minicystis rosea</named-content>, NCBI accession no. GCF_001931535, 16,040,666 bp). Failure to pass these requirements excludes the samples from further subsequent analysis. The threshold values can be adjusted by the user at runtime.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s4.5">
      <title>BaAP: FastQ quality control and generation of pFASTQ.</title>
      <p>Input FASTQs that pass the validation steps undergo quality control steps to remove poor-quality reads. BBDuk, a component of BBTools (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>), removes Illumina adapters and phiX contaminants and filters reads based on length and quality. Base calls are corrected using Lighter (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). At this stage, the default procedure is to downsample the FASTQ file to an average 100× <italic>g</italic>enome coverage (if over 100×) with Reformat (from BBTools). This step, which was used in StAP (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), significantly saves computing time at little final cost to assembly or SNP calling accuracy. The genome size for coverage calculation is either provided by the user or estimated based on the FASTQ data by Mash (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The user can provide their own value for downsampling FASTQs or disable it completely. Summary statistics before and after QC are created using FastQC (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>) and fastq-scan (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). After QC, the original FASTQs are no longer used, and only the processed FASTQs (pFASTQ) are used in subsequent analysis.</p>

    <sec id="s4.6">
      <title>BaAP: assembly, reference mapping, and decomposition.</title>
      <p>BaAP uses Shovill (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>) to create a draft <italic>de novo</italic> assembly with MEGAHIT (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>), SKESA (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>) (default), SPAdes (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), or Velvet (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>) and makes corrections using Pilon (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>) from the pFASTQ. Alternatively, if long reads were provided with paired-end pFASTQ, a hybrid assembly is created with Unicycler (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). The quality of the draft assembly is assessed by QUAST (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>) and CheckM (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). Summary statistics for the draft assembly are created using assembly scan (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). If the total size of the draft assembly fails to meet a user-specified minimum size, further assembly-based analyses are discontinued. Otherwise, a BLAST+ (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) nucleotide database is created from the contigs. The draft assembly is also annotated using Prokka (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). If available at runtime, Prokka will first annotate with a clustered RefSeq protein set, followed by its default databases. The annotated genes and proteins are then subjected to antimicrobial resistance prediction with AMRFinder+ (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>).</p>
      <p>For each pFASTQ, sketches are created using Mash (<italic>k </italic>= 21,31) and Sourmash (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) (<italic>k </italic>= 21,31,51). McCortex (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>) is used to count 31-mers in the pFASTQ.</p>

      <title>BaAP: optional steps.</title>
      <p>At runtime, Bactopia checks for BaDs specified by the command line (if any) and adjusts the settings of the pipeline accordingly. Examples of processes executed only if a BaDs is specified include Ariba (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) analysis for each available reference data set, sequence containment estimation against RefSeq (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) with mash screen (<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>) and against GenBank (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) with sourmash lca gather (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), and PLSDB (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), with mash screen and BLAST+. The sequence type (ST) of the sample is determined with BLAST+ and Ariba. The nearest reference RefSeq genome, based on mash (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) distance, is downloaded with ncbi-genome-download (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), and variants are called with Snippy (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>). Alternatively, one or more reference genomes can be provided by the user. Users can also provide sequences for sequence alignment with BLAST+ and per-base coverage with BWA (<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>, <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>) and Bedtools (<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>).</p>

      <title>Bactopia tools.</title>
      <p>After BaAP has successfully finished, it will create a directory for each strain with subdirectories for each analysis result. The directory structure is independent of the project or options chosen. Bactopia Tools (BaTs) are a set of comparative-analysis workflows written using Nextflow that take advantage of the predictable output structure from BaAP. Each BaT is created from the same framework and a subcommand (“bactopia tools create”) is available to simplify the creation of future BaTs.</p>
      <p>Five BaTs were used for analyses in this article. The “summary” BaT outputs a summary report of the set of samples and a list of samples that failed to meet thresholds set by the user. This summary includes basic sequence and assembly stats as well as technical (pass/fail) information. The “roary” BaT creates a pan-genome of the set of samples with Roary (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), with the option to include RefSeq (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) completed genomes. The “fastani” BaT determines the pairwise average nucleotide identity (ANI) for each sample with FastANI (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The “phyloflash” BaT reconstructs 16S rRNA gene sequences with phyloFlash (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The “gtdb” BaT assigns taxonomic classifications from the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) with GTDB-tk (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Each Bactopia tool has a separate Nextflow workflow with its own conda environment, Docker image, and Singularity image. Additional BaTs are currently available for eggNOG-mapper (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>, <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>), ISMapper (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>), Mashtree (<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>), and PIRATE (<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>).</p>
