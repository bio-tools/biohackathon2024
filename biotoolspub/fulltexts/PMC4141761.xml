    <abstract>
      <p>Sub-networks can expose complex patterns in an entire bio-molecular network by extracting interactions that depend on temporal or condition-specific contexts. When genes interact with each other during cellular processes, they may form differential co-expression patterns with other genes across different cell states. The identification of condition-specific sub-networks is of great importance in investigating how a living cell adapts to environmental changes. In this work, we propose the weighted MAXimum clique (WMAXC) method to identify a condition-specific sub-network. WMAXC first proposes scoring functions that jointly measure condition-specific changes to both individual genes and gene-gene co-expressions. It then employs a weaker formula of a general maximum clique problem and relates the maximum scored clique of a weighted graph to the optimization of a quadratic objective function under sparsity constraints. We combine a continuous genetic algorithm and a projection procedure to obtain a single optimal sub-network that maximizes the objective function (scoring function) over the standard simplex (sparsity constraints). We applied the WMAXC method to both simulated data and real data sets of ovarian and prostate cancer. Compared with previous methods, WMAXC selected a large fraction of cancer-related genes, which were enriched in cancer-related pathways. The results demonstrated that our method efficiently captured a subset of genes relevant under the investigated condition.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>A central problem in network biology is the identification of genes and pathways involved in the same biological processes or physiological conditions. The details of control mechanisms in biological processes can be understood by analyzing interacting neighbors and local patterns. Network structures often have been used to describe these complex bio-molecular pathways and functional modules by representing a whole set of interactions as overlapping sub-networks, each associated with a specific condition <xref rid="pone.0104993-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104993-Barabsi1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p>
    <p>Many methods have been developed to construct bio-molecular networks by comparing multiple sets of microarray data under different conditions. Because expressions of different genes in a series of biological conditions influence each other, correlations between genes have been widely used to analyze microarray gene-expression measurements. Waaijenborg and Zwinderman <xref rid="pone.0104993-Waaijenborg1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> developed a penalized canonical correlation analysis method to extract a subset of variables that capture the common features among genes by maximizing a canonical correlation between expression of genes. Witten and Tibshirani <xref rid="pone.0104993-Witten1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> presented some extension formulas to the sparse canonical correlation analysis as a supervised method, which resulted in the identification of linear combinations of sets of variables that are correlated and associated with its outcome.</p>
    <p>To fully understand the complex biological processes, the effective integration of diverse sets of data and knowledge is required. Protein-DNA interaction and gene expression data were combined for regulatory network identification <xref rid="pone.0104993-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Integrating protein-protein interaction (PPI) data with gene expression data has also been attempted for the identification of biologically meaningful and cancer-related networks in cancer studies <xref rid="pone.0104993-Ideker1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0104993-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The integration increases the accuracy in identifying genes jointly regulated in the same condition. Guo et al. <xref rid="pone.0104993-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> developed an edge-based scoring function for gene-gene co-expression by using both gene expression and PPI data. However, in this method, PPI information is used to define existence of edges in the bio-molecular network so that only gene pairs that are included in the existing PPI network are considered in the scoring function. Lai et al. <xref rid="pone.0104993-Lai1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> extended the traditional F-statistic to obtain an expected conditional F-statistic (ECF-statistic), which measures the connectivity between genes. The ECF-statistic was used in a COSINE method <xref rid="pone.0104993-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> to measure gene-gene co-expression from gene expression data. For the use of the PPI information in COSINE, only the number of interactions in a selected sub-network was considered in their scoring function to calculate its sub-network adjust score, instead of using each interaction in the PPI network. A mixed integer linear programming model <xref rid="pone.0104993-Qiu1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and an integer linear programming approach <xref rid="pone.0104993-Backes1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> were developed to identify differentially expressed pathways using both data sets. However, these two integer linear programming approaches have used expression values of individual genes without accounting for correlation or co-expression information, which might be less informative.</p>
    <p>Finding a sub-network that maximizes the score of differential expressions of genes and differential co-expression of gene pairs can be formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem. In practice, bio-molecular networks are often large in scale <xref rid="pone.0104993-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Hence, it is impossible to exactly solve a large combinatorial optimization problem within a reasonable time. For examples, in the COSINE method <xref rid="pone.0104993-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, a genetic algorithm was used to find a binary vector, in which 1 or 0 represents presence or absence of a gene in the sub-network, and its space complexity is exponential as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e001.jpg"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e002.jpg"/></inline-formula> is the total number of genes. In the edge-based method <xref rid="pone.0104993-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, a searching procedure based on simulated annealing was used to find the sub-network. It iteratively tests whether the addition or removal of an edge will increase their sub-network adjust score during the annealing process, and its space complexity is also exponential as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e003.jpg"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e004.jpg"/></inline-formula> is the number of possible edges (edges in the PPI network). Ideker et al. <xref rid="pone.0104993-Ideker1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> also used the simulated annealing approach; however, it tended to produce a large sub-network that was often difficult to interpret. Although Rajagopalan and Agarwal <xref rid="pone.0104993-Rajagopalan1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and Nacu et al. <xref rid="pone.0104993-Nacu1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> offered several improvements, they were also based on heuristic techniques with combinatorial selection and required the estimation of additional parameters. Various graph theory-based approaches, such as sequential greedy heuristics <xref rid="pone.0104993-Breitling1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104993-Ulitsky1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, have been presented. These heuristics generate a maximal scoring sub-network through the repeated addition of a vertex into a partial sub-network, or by the repeated deletion of a vertex from a sub-network. In addition to heuristics, several local optimization-based approaches have been presented to extract condition specific sub-networks. A method developed by Wang and Xia <xref rid="pone.0104993-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> was inspired by a KKT condition and was used to iteratively find a local minimum from a predetermined initial solution. A large number of local solutions can be found for the non-convex problem. Depending on the selection of the initial solution, many of them might not be significant under the investigated condition, which may give rise to false positives.</p>
    <p>In our work, we reformulate the sub-network identification problem as a constrained optimization problem for continuous variables. It is an approximation of the general combinatorial problem, based on the theorem posed by Motzkin and Straus <xref rid="pone.0104993-Motzkin1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. To construct a background network under investigated condition, we used two statistical measurements to represent activity of each genes and interaction behaviors of each pair of genes; a modified <italic>T</italic>-statistic as the differential expression of each gene and a conditional expectation of the modified <italic>T</italic>-statistic as the differential gene-gene co-expression. In our first experiment, we used the two measurements to construct the background network that represents the weight parameters of the optimization problem. We then employed a continuous genetic algorithm, which has the advantage of being capable of jumping out of local solutions, and used a projection procedure that maximizes our objective function under a sparsity constraint. In the second experiment, we reconstructed the background network by integrating PPI information with the gene expression profiles for each gene pair, and obtained a more robust estimation of the neighbors of each gene in the network. We first tested the performance of our method using simulated data sets, and then applied the method to analyze human ovarian and prostate cancer data sets. The results demonstrated that our method efficiently captures relevant interaction behaviors under the investigated conditions. An overview of the workflow is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104993-g001">Figure 1</xref>, and more detailed descriptions are given in the Methods section.</p>

        <p>(1) Gene expression data consisting of normal and cancer samples (1A) and the PPI network (1B) are used as inputs. (2) We begin by constructing two responsive networks under the investigated condition: In (2A), we use two statistic measurements to construct a bio-molecular network. For each gene, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e005.jpg"/></inline-formula> is used to measure activity of gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e006.jpg"/></inline-formula> (a node score) and for each pair of genes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e007.jpg"/></inline-formula> is used to measure connectivity relationship between gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e008.jpg"/></inline-formula> and gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e009.jpg"/></inline-formula> (an edge score). In (2B), for each interaction in PPI network, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e010.jpg"/></inline-formula> is used to measure activity of interaction behavior between gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e011.jpg"/></inline-formula> and gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e012.jpg"/></inline-formula> (an edge contribution score from PPI) and for each gene, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e013.jpg"/></inline-formula> is used to measure the weighted degree of gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e014.jpg"/></inline-formula> (a node contribution score from PPI) under the condition. (3) We then combine the two responsive networks to construct the background network by assigning node and edge scores to a set of genes. Orange edges represent gene-gene co-expression estimated from only gene expression data and green edges represent activity of interactions in the PPI network. In the process of combining two networks, new edges are included to (2A) although they are not in the existing PPI network. (4) Finally, we solve the constrained optimization problem to obtain the single optimal sub-network.</p>

    <title>Methods</title>
    <p>We first describe scoring functions to measure gene expression differences and gene-gene correlations for given two conditions, which generate weight values of nodes and edges in a background network. We then introduce an optimization model to identify the maximal scoring sub-network. Finally, the proposed model is extended to include PPI interactions.</p>
    <sec id="s2a">
      <title>Scoring function of WMAXC</title>
      <p>The entire background network is represented as a graph <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e015.jpg"/></inline-formula>, where a set of nodes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e016.jpg"/></inline-formula> represents genes, and a set of edges <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e017.jpg"/></inline-formula> represents the connectivity relationships among these genes. Let <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e018.jpg"/></inline-formula> be a set of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e019.jpg"/></inline-formula> genes. For each gene, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e020.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e021.jpg"/></inline-formula> denote the numbers of samples in two different conditions, such as normal and cancer. We then have a gene expression data set, given as two matrices with sizes of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e022.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e023.jpg"/></inline-formula>. A modified <italic>T</italic>-statistic is used as a scoring function to measure the differential expression of each gene. For each node in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e024.jpg"/></inline-formula>, the differential expression value of the corresponding gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e025.jpg"/></inline-formula> is computed as<disp-formula id="pone.0104993.e026"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e026.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e027.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e028.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e029.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e030.jpg"/></inline-formula> are the sample means and standard deviations of gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e031.jpg"/></inline-formula> in the normal and cancer conditions, respectively, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e032.jpg"/></inline-formula> is a constant chosen to minimize the coefficient of variation of <italic>T</italic>-statistic <xref rid="pone.0104993-Tusher1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> (see more descriptions and Figure S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104993.s001">File S1</xref>).</p>
      <p>For each edge in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e033.jpg"/></inline-formula>, the conditional expectation of the modified <italic>T</italic>-statistic is used to measure differential gene-gene co-expressions across two conditions. To measure the gene-gene correlations for a pair of genes, we assume that samples of genes are jointly normal distributed in a particular condition, such as normal (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e034.jpg"/></inline-formula>) or cancer (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e035.jpg"/></inline-formula>). By the assumption, a bivariate normal distribution of two genes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e036.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e037.jpg"/></inline-formula> in the normal condition is<disp-formula id="pone.0104993.e038"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e038.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>

      <p>Based on the theoretical validation, we reformulate the sub-network identification problem as a continuous optimization problem that is an approximation of the general combinatorial problem and a generalization of the problem in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0104993.e084">Equation (6</xref>). The proposed method relates the densest part (a maximum scored clique) of a weighted graph to the optimization of a quadratic function under sparsity constraints. A weaker formula of the maximum clique problem, the optimization problem for identifying a condition-specific sub-network from a bio-molecular network, can be formulated as follows.<disp-formula id="pone.0104993.e102"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e102.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(8)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e103.jpg"/></inline-formula> is a vector in which <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e104.jpg"/></inline-formula> represents a node score measuring differential expression for gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e105.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e106.jpg"/></inline-formula> is a symmetric matrix in which <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e107.jpg"/></inline-formula> represents an edge score measuring the connectivity strength between gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e108.jpg"/></inline-formula> and gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e109.jpg"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e110.jpg"/></inline-formula> is a positive parameter to balance and to integrate the two terms of the objective function in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0104993.e102">Equation (8</xref>).

      <title>Sub-network identification from gene expression and PPI network data</title>
      <p>We extend our model to incorporate the assumption that the significance score of one gene or its interactions in a network depends not only on its own gene expression profile but also on the profiles of its neighbors in the PPI network. Some interactions in the PPI network are activated under the investigated condition while others are not activated. If two genes interact with each other under a particular condition, the expression distance between them might be significantly changed across two conditions (a normal condition and a cancer condition). Based on this assumption, we propose a scoring function called the distance-based <italic>T</italic>-score to measure the change in gene expression distances across two conditions for each pair of genes in the PPI network. This function is used to test the significance score of each interaction in the PPI network.</p>
      <p>As described in the section of scoring function of WMAXC, the gene expression profile data are given as two matrices with sizes of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e120.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e121.jpg"/></inline-formula>.

For a pair <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e126.jpg"/></inline-formula>, let <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e127.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e128.jpg"/></inline-formula> be the normalized distances between gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e129.jpg"/></inline-formula> and gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e130.jpg"/></inline-formula> in the normal and cancer conditions, respectively. Then, the distance-based <italic>T</italic>-score, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e131.jpg"/></inline-formula>, can be formulated as follows.<disp-formula id="pone.0104993.e132"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e132.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(9)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e133.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e134.jpg"/></inline-formula> are the geometric averages of the standard deviations of samples of gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e135.jpg"/></inline-formula> and gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e136.jpg"/></inline-formula> in the normal and cancer conditions, respectively (see more descriptions and Figure S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104993.s001">File S1</xref>). One of the advantages of using <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e137.jpg"/></inline-formula> score is that less relevant interactions in the PPI network under the investigated condition can be thinned out. Since both the conditional expectation of the modified <italic>T</italic>-statistic and the distance-based <italic>T</italic>-score are estimated from the same population, we reconstruct our background network by integrating the two types of information. To quantify absolute changes of expression under the investigated condition, we transformed <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e138.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e139.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e140.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e141.jpg"/></inline-formula> in their absolute values. The weight parameters of the objective function in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0104993.e102">Equation (8</xref>) are then calculated as follows.<disp-formula id="pone.0104993.e142"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e142.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(10)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e143.jpg"/></inline-formula> is a weighted degree for gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e144.jpg"/></inline-formula> in the PPI network, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e145.jpg"/></inline-formula> are gene indexes, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e146.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e147.jpg"/></inline-formula> are positive scaling parameters defining the contribution of PPI information to the condition-specific network. We set <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e148.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e149.jpg"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e150.jpg"/></inline-formula> ensures that the maximum of entries in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e151.jpg"/></inline-formula> matrix is equal to the maximum of entries in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e152.jpg"/></inline-formula> matrix and similar normalization is applied to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e153.jpg"/></inline-formula>.</p>
      <p>The PPI network is very sparse; the percentage of interacting protein pairs is only 0.0888% for the ovarian cancer data and 0.1280% for the prostate cancer data. Moreover, some interactions in the existing PPI network might not be significantly activated under the investigated condition. In this case, they might have very small values in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e154.jpg"/></inline-formula> (near to zero). Therefore, the DBT score matrix becomes more sparse, and only the entries corresponding to significant interactions in the PPI network have observable contributions to the matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e155.jpg"/></inline-formula> and the vector <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e156.jpg"/></inline-formula>. However, the weight matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e157.jpg"/></inline-formula> and the weight vector <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e158.jpg"/></inline-formula> are not sparse, because until now we used all differential expression and co-expression values without considering the significance of them. Therefore, genes with non-significant changes and correlations in expression values contribute their weights to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e159.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e160.jpg"/></inline-formula>. In other words, all non zero entries in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e161.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e162.jpg"/></inline-formula> can influence the behavior (slope) of the continuous objective function even though their values are not high. The influence in the objective function may lead the solution to a local maximum. To avoid the local convergence, we define two hard thresholds as follows.<disp-formula id="pone.0104993.e163"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e163.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(11)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e164.jpg"/></inline-formula> is the mean value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e165.jpg"/></inline-formula>, computed as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e166.jpg"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e167.jpg"/></inline-formula> is the maximum of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e168.jpg"/></inline-formula>, and for each <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e169.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e170.jpg"/></inline-formula>.</p>

      <p>A reasonable balance between the quadratic and linear terms of the objective function in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0104993.e102">Equation (8</xref>) is essential for the stability and robustness of the optimization result. Unfortunately, it is difficult to define an objective criterion for biological relevance. Regarding optimization, the term with greater value should be more informative in our task. To achieve the stability of the solution, we compared the magnitudes of edge and node scores in terms of statistical distributions of score values. Because of the restrictions imposed by the sparsity constraint, the sub-network scores are not affected by their size. For both score terms, sub-network scores of different sizes behave similarly, and the majorities of edge and node score values fall in the region around their means. Therefore, the edge and node score values of a randomly selected sub-network have more chances to fall around the mean (distribution plots are given in Figures S3 and S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104993.s001">File S1</xref>), which allows the possibility of estimating the magnitudes that make the solution more stable. To estimate the magnitudes of the two terms, we used the following procedure: 1) Randomly sample a large number of sub-networks by selecting points on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e172.jpg"/></inline-formula>. Each point <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e173.jpg"/></inline-formula> presents a sub-network, and the edge and node scores of the sub-network are calculated as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e174.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e175.jpg"/></inline-formula>, respectively; 2) Compute the means <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e176.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e177.jpg"/></inline-formula>, standard deviations <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e178.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e179.jpg"/></inline-formula> of two score terms; 3) The magnitudes of both edge and node score terms are defined as follows: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e180.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e181.jpg"/></inline-formula>; and then 4) We set <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e182.jpg"/></inline-formula>.</p>

Let <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e189.jpg"/></inline-formula> be the global maximum of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0104993.e102">Equation (8</xref>) over <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e190.jpg"/></inline-formula>. We then project the solution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e191.jpg"/></inline-formula> onto <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e192.jpg"/></inline-formula> in the Euclidean space <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e193.jpg"/></inline-formula> using the algorithm <xref rid="pone.0104993-Songsiri1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> to obtain a sparser solution <xref rid="pone.0104993-Kyrillidis1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Since projection of any point onto convex set is unique (see the projection theorem and Figure S6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104993.s001">File S1</xref>) and the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e194.jpg"/></inline-formula> is convex, the problem of finding the Euclidean projection of a vector <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e195.jpg"/></inline-formula> onto <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e196.jpg"/></inline-formula> can be described by the following convex optimization problem.<disp-formula id="pone.0104993.e197"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e197.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(12)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e198.jpg"/></inline-formula> is a <italic>k</italic>-dimensional vector used as an optimization variable, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e199.jpg"/></inline-formula> is the projection of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e200.jpg"/></inline-formula> onto <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e201.jpg"/></inline-formula> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104993.s001">File S1</xref>). In view of the Lagrangian duality, the optimal solutions of the primal and dual problems are equal to a saddle point. In our task, the optimization variable of the dual problem is simply a scalar. Hence, it is more efficient to solve the dual problem instead of directly solving the primal problem in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0104993.e197">Equation (12</xref>). By considering the well-known result of the projection onto standard simplex <xref rid="pone.0104993-Michelot1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, the optimal projection <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e202.jpg"/></inline-formula> is expressed as follows.<disp-formula id="pone.0104993.e203"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e203.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(13)</label></disp-formula>where the dual optimal point <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e204.jpg"/></inline-formula> is given by the root of the following equation:</p>

      <p>We showed the performance of WMAXC on simulated data by comparing it with COSINE <xref rid="pone.0104993-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, because COSINE was initially compared to several other methods, including jActiveModules <xref rid="pone.0104993-Ideker1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, an edge-based method <xref rid="pone.0104993-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and a local method <xref rid="pone.0104993-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. We constructed five simulation data sets from multivariate normal distributions: four case data sets and one reference data set.</p>
      <p>Each data set consisted of 1,000 variables (genes) for 50 samples. For each gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e207.jpg"/></inline-formula>, we draw the mean <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e208.jpg"/></inline-formula> and the standard deviation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e209.jpg"/></inline-formula> from the uniform distribution on the observed range of normal data [−0.5,0.5], and then estimated the correlation coefficient <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e210.jpg"/></inline-formula> for each pair of genes (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e211.jpg"/></inline-formula>,<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e212.jpg"/></inline-formula>).

      <p>We first simulated the reference data from joint normal distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e218.jpg"/></inline-formula>, and the reference data was compared to each of the four case data sets.

        <title>Comparison on ovarian cancer</title>
        <p>To evaluate whether the genes in the identified sub-network are related to ovarian cancer, we used a set of 379 experimentally verified ovarian cancer-related genes from the Dragon Database of Genes <xref rid="pone.0104993-Kaur1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> as reference genes. Among the 379 genes, 315 were included in the 8,721 genes of our data set. For WMAXC, the initialization parameters of the genetic algorithm were set as follows: the number of iterations  = 60,000, mutation rate  = 1/(k+1) and crossover rate  = 0.5, where k is the number of optimization variables (the number of genes). We first applied our method using only the gene expression profile data, and then integrated the PPI network with gene expression profiles using the Distance Based <italic>T</italic>-score as described in the Methods section. Performances of the two approaches are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104993-t002">Table 2</xref>. The fold enrichment of the genes selected among the ovarian cancer-related genes had increased from 1.828 to 2.454 when the PPI network was integrated with the gene expressions, compared to using only the gene expressions. A list of 100 genes with the highest contribution scores to the condition-specific network is given in Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104993.s001">File S1</xref>. Using a CPU with 3.40 GHz and 32 GB RAM, it took 26 hours to search for the maximal scoring sub-network. To test whether the genetic algorithm reached the convergence, we quantified the variations in objective function values for the population in each iteration. For both ovarian and prostate cancer data, the variation was almost zero after running 60,000 iterations, and the minimum values of the objective function became stable in the last 10,000 iterations. This result suggests that the solution had reached convergence.</p>

        <p>For the COSINE method, both gene expression profile and PPI data were used.

As a result, the sub-network with a size of 806 was selected. The fold enrichment was 1.237, and it took around 56 hours with 1,000 iterations. For the BMRF method, both gene expression profile and PPI data were used. In addition, a set of hub genes related to the investigated condition was required as an input. Hence, we collected a set of 209 hub genes from KEGG, consisting of genes included in the ovarian cancer-related pathways, such as ubiquitin, coagulation, and hedgehog signaling pathways. BMRF extracted the sub-network of the size of 916 genes, and the fold enrichment was around 1.75. However, its accuracy was depending on the choice of the set of hub genes; for a set of randomly selected genes, the fold enrichment was decreased to 1.041. Overall, the comparison demonstrated that WMAXC outperformed both the COSINE and BMRF methods on the real data set.</p>

Among the 703 genes, 400 were included in our dataset. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e241.jpg"/></inline-formula> was used for the WMAXC method, and the initialization parameters of the genetic algorithm were the same as those used in the analysis of the ovarian cancer data. WMAXC extracted a sub-network of the size 539 and a fold enrichment of 2.35. A list of 100 genes with the highest contribution scores to the condition specific network is given in Table S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104993.s001">File S1</xref>.

      <title>Analysis on real data</title>
      <p>Although only 57 out of 643 genes forming the condition-specific sub-network were included in DDOC as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104993-t002">Table 2</xref>, some ovarian cancer-related genes might not be included in DDOC. Hence, we manually checked whether 20 candidate genes with the highest contribution scores were ovarian cancer-related genes. Among them, 16 genes were known to be related to ovarian cancer by DDOC or the manual literature search (Table S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104993.s001">File S1</xref>). The remaining four genes are SELL, UBAP2L, TFEB and DPPA4. Although there were no evidences of their involvements in ovarian cancer development, these four genes were highly co-expressed with other ovarian cancer and cancer related genes in the condition specific network. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104993-g002">Figure 2</xref>, they directly shared significant co-expression patterns with 159 neighbors. Surprisingly, 59.1% (94/159) of neighbors of these four genes are ovarian cancer-related genes and 35.8% (57/159) are other cancer-related genes. A list of these genes with their literature evidences is shown in Table S5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104993.s001">File S1</xref>. For only 5% (8/159) of neighbor genes, we cannot find literature evidences showing their relevance to cancer. We further investigated that these four genes were actively involved in the other cancer types and biological phenomenon. L-selectin, SELL, is a member of a family of adhesion receptors that play important roles in lymphocyte-endothelial cell interactions. Resto et al. <xref rid="pone.0104993-Resto1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> investigated adhesive interactions between lymphocytes and head and neck cancer cells (HNSCC cells) under shear stress, and the interactions can be mediated by L-selectin. Kuiper et al. <xref rid="pone.0104993-Kuiper1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> investigated that upregulation of the transcription factor TFEB in some particular chromosomal position may play an important role in the regulation of renal cancer progression. Maldonado-Saldivia et al. <xref rid="pone.0104993-MaldonadoSaldivia1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> provided an evidence that DPPA4 is downregulated during fetal germ line progression and this process might be required to facilitate appropriate germ line differentiation. Moreover, it may provide an implication in the development of germ cell cancer in human. Although there was no much evidence of their involvements in ovarian cancer, our results suggest that these genes might be closely related to ovarian cancer progression.</p>

      <p>By applying the WMAXC method to the ovarian cancer data, we identified a biologically meaningful sub-network involved in many ovarian cancer related pathways. Measured using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) <xref rid="pone.0104993-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, 60 pathways were significantly enriched by the KEGG pathway, including the ErbB signaling pathway, the Notch signaling pathway, and the TGF-<italic>β</italic> signaling pathway (Table S6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104993.s001">File S1</xref>). The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the ErbB family of tyrosine kinase receptors. Overexpression of EGFR and its downstream targets are associated with resistance to chemotherapy for ovarian cancer <xref rid="pone.0104993-deGraeff1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Ovarian cancer cells, in which Notch3 was frequently amplified and overexpressed, are dependent on the Notch3 signaling pathway for cellular survival and growth. Notch3 expression is also associated with chemo resistance in ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma <xref rid="pone.0104993-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. The TGF-<italic>β</italic> signaling pathway is activated in ovarian cancer, and the inhibition of this pathway by a small molecule is a promising strategy in the treatment of ovarian cancer <xref rid="pone.0104993-Yamamura1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The sub-network identified using the prostate cancer data included 62 significantly enriched KEGG pathways, including prostate cancer, neurotrophinn signaling, MAPK signaling, Wnt signaling, TGF-<italic>β</italic> signaling, chemokine signaling pathways, and the regulation of actin cytoskeleton (Table S7 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104993.s001">File S1</xref>). For instance, it has been demonstrated that the progression of prostate cancer is affected by changes in the expression of auctocrine neurotrophins <xref rid="pone.0104993-Satoh1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. MAPK signaling is shown to be activated in prostate cancer, especially in later stages of the disease <xref rid="pone.0104993-Kinkade1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0104993-AbreuMartin1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, and it was recently suggested that the MAPK signaling pathway may be a target for prostate cancer therapy, if it is inhibited simultaneously with other pathways, such as PI3K/AKT signaling <xref rid="pone.0104993-daSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. The upregulation of some Wnt pathway members was observed in ERG-positive prostate cancers, and it has been shown that knockdown of the ERG gene in VCaP prostate cancer cells causes an activation of cell adhesion and expression changes in Wnt signaling. These findings were validated by gene expression data from both clinical prostate cancer samples and from ERG over-expressing non-transformed prostate epithelial cells <xref rid="pone.0104993-Gupta1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Several studies have shown that changes in the levels of TGF-<italic>β</italic> pathway components are related to prostate cancer progression and cellular responses <xref rid="pone.0104993-Wikstrm1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104993-Adler1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, and <xref rid="pone.0104993-Shariat1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. In addition, chemokine signaling pathways and the regulation of actin cytoskeleton have been studied and experimentally validated to be associated with prostate cancer <xref rid="pone.0104993-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104993-Wu2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>Our main goal was to design an algorithm that reveals a subset of genes closely related to a particular disease. Based on an optimization framework, we proposed an effective method, WMAXC, for identifying a condition-specific sub-network under a particular condition. WMAXC has the following advantages: (1) It extracts the global optimal sub-network that exhibits significant alterations across two phenotypes; WMAXC considers the weighted contributions of both expression difference for each single gene and the differential correlation of each pair of genes. (2) WMAXC effectively integrates diverse sets of data and knowledge to construct the background network under a particular condition. (3) An optimization formulation with strong theoretical validation is used to represent a continuous version of the general combinatorial problem for identifying a condition-specific sub-network. (4) WMAXC considers all nodes and edges at the same time to search a single optimal sub-network. (5) Genetic algorithm and a projection procedure are combined to approximate the global solution to our problem. (6) A weight parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e242.jpg"/></inline-formula> is chosen to make the solution stable to the problem, and it is also adaptive to the specific dataset being analyzed.</p>
    <p>WMAXC integrates gene expressions and the PPI network, and the positive scaling parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e243.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e244.jpg"/></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0104993.e142">Equation (10</xref>) are contribution factors of the PPI network in identifying disease-specific genes. We expect that for larger <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e245.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e246.jpg"/></inline-formula> values, the accuracy will increase with a high-quality PPI network, while false positive genes might be included with a low-quality PPI network. In the Results section, we used a high-quality PPI network, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e247.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e248.jpg"/></inline-formula> provide a stable performance, and the fold enrichment is relatively high as around 2.45. To show how the performances of the method are affected depending on PPI data quality and scaling parameters, we simulated three PPI data sets with different qualities by randomly removing a fraction of existing edges from the PPI network and randomly adding the same numbers of edges into the PPI network. Then, the simulated PPI data sets were used with three different sets of scaling parameters in our model and corresponding results for each scaling parameter are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104993-t003">Table 3</xref>. For relatively high-quality data sets such as the original PPI and data set-1, the fold enrichment was increased with larger values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e249.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e250.jpg"/></inline-formula>. On the other hand, for the low-quality PPI data sets such as data set-3, the fold enrichment was decreased with larger values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e251.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e252.jpg"/></inline-formula>.</p>

    <p>WMAXC is flexible. It can be simply adapted to directed graphs or even to the integration of gene expression and pathways. For example, instead of using a PPI network, the union of regulatory pathways can be used to represent directed interaction and to compute the DBT score for a pair of genes. In this case, the weight matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0104993.e256.jpg"/></inline-formula> is non-symmetric, and only slight modifications are required to construct a bio-molecular network from the gene expression profile.
