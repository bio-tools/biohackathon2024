      <p id="Par1">DNA methylation plays vital roles in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. There are three forms of DNA methylation in prokaryotes: <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenine (6mA), <italic>N</italic><sup>4</sup>-methylcytosine (4mC), and 5-methylcytosine (5mC). Although many sequencing methods have been developed to sequence specific types of methylation, few technologies can be used for efficiently mapping multiple types of methylation. Here, we present NT-seq for mapping all three types of methylation simultaneously. NT-seq reliably detects all known methylation motifs in two bacterial genomes and can be used for identifying de novo methylation motifs. NT-seq provides a simple and efficient solution for detecting multiple types of DNA methylation.</p>

    <title>Background</title>
    <p id="Par2">Although epigenetic regulation has been reported in all domains of life, most studies focused on eukaryotes. However, mounting evidence for the crucial function of epigenetic regulatory pathways in prokaryotes has been reported. Three forms of DNA methylation, <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenine (6mA), <italic>N</italic><sup>4</sup>-methylcytosine (4mC), and 5-methylcytosine (5mC), are prevalent and play essential roles in viral defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], mismatch repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] in prokaryotes. DNA methylation occurs in a motif-dependent manner in bacteria, and methylation motifs vary among different bacterial strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. While emerging evidence has shown the functional role of bacterial methylation in transcriptional regulation, how DNA methylation and methyltransferases orchestrate the gene expression to determine the phenotype is still elusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. One of the major challenges is the lack of efficient and straightforward methods for comprehensive genomic methylome profiling.</p>
    <p id="Par3">Most of the next-generation genomic sequencing (NGS) methods for DNA methylation mapping have been developed for 5mC, such as bisulfite sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], but 6mA is the most prevalent form of methylation in prokaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Multiple antibody-based or enzyme-based approaches have been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], yet these methods are either complicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], low resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], or restricted to particular enzyme-cutting motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. While the 3rd-generation single-molecule real-time sequencing (SMRT-seq) has been utilized to detect DNA methylation motifs in bacterial genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the current SMRT-seq lacks open-source bioinformatic tools or independent methods that could cross-validate the results. Moreover, although SMRT-seq has been widely used to detect 6mA and 4mC in bacterial genomes, recent results from 4mC-TAB-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and mass spectrometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] indicated that SMRT-seq might overestimate 4mC in bacterial genomes. The Oxford Nanopore sequencing has also shown the ability to detect multiple types of DNA methylation in bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], but the signal of Nanopore sequencing in detecting bacterial DNA methylation, especially the 6mA, is still noisy, and the machine-learning analysis methods need more training datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, since SMRT-seq and Nanopore sequencing can only detect methylation from unamplified genomic DNA, the required amount of input DNA is the limitation for applying single-molecule methods on restricted clinical samples. Therefore, to help fully understand microbial epigenomics, we must develop an efficient chemical-based NGS strategy to detect all three types of DNA methylation (whole methylome profiling).</p>
    <p id="Par4">DNA base deamination is a well-known chemical strategy to detect DNA methylation; for example, bisulfite sequencing, in which unmethylated cytosine is efficiently deaminated and converted to thymine during PCR amplification, while the modified cytosines such as 5mC and 5hmC are not converted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For adenine methylation, although it was reported more than 60 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], such a condition that could be applied for sequencing was not clarified until recently. Deamination induced by nitrous acid has been shown only to deaminate unmethylated adenine but not 6mA, which was utilized to develop nitrite sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and NOseq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] for DNA 6mA or RNA m6A detection in oligos or targeted sequencing settings. As far as we know, nitrite treatment has not been applied for genomic methylome profiling because generating the genomic sequencing library in such conditions and following bioinformatic analysis are still challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par5">Based on the previous studies, we developed NT-seq (nitrite treatment followed by next-generation sequencing), a sequencing method for detecting multiple types of DNA methylation genome-wide. We demonstrate that NT-seq can detect not only 6mA but also 4mC and 5mC. NT-seq can identify methylation motifs of all three types of methylation in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> genomes. We also show that NT-seq can be used for methylation motif de novo discovery in a microbial community standard sample. Thus, NT-seq provides an efficient, cost-effective, and high-resolution method for methylation motif detection in both single bacterial species and metagenomic settings. Of particular note, 6mA has also been reported in lower eukaryotes and mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The 6mA methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (6mA DIP-seq) is the primary approach for profiling 6mA in eukaryotic genomes, but the specificity has been debated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Since our method can efficiently recognize 6mA, coupled with DIP-Seq, we present that DIP-NT-seq can detect 6mA at single-base resolution with high fidelity and eliminate the false-positive 6mA sites in DIP-seq. Thus, this method can be used independently or coupled with other protocols for methylome profiling, which will pave the way for DNA modification studies in different contexts.</p>

      <title>Experimental design of NT-seq</title>
      <p id="Par6">Nitrite treatment has been reported to deaminate adenine (A), cytosine (C), and guanine (G) for decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The deamination of A or C changes the bases and is read by polymerases as G or T, respectively, in PCR amplification (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. As the methyl groups of 6mA and 4mC are located at the amino groups of adenine and cytosine, 6mA and 4mC can block the deamination of adenine and cytosine under nitrite conditions. Recently, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) results showed that <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) was converted to <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-nitroso-m6A (m<sup>6</sup>A-NO) but not deaminated inosine by nitrite treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. While the nitrite treatment has been adapted to detect DNA 6mA and RNA m<sup>6</sup>A, it has been only tested in oligos or targeted RNA locus as a proof-of-concept for methylation sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Moreover, it can also be used to distinguish 5mC from cytosine because the deamination rate of 5mC in nitrite treatment has been reported to be up to 4.5-fold higher than cytosine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). However, whether this approach could be applied for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) with genomic DNA libraries remains unknown. Here, we hypothesize that the DNA 4mC, like the 6mA, can also be detected with nitrite treatment, and we can build the NGS sequencing library for NGS sequencing to define the whole methylome profiling (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a).
<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Principle and workflow of NT-seq. <bold>a</bold> Schematic illustration of nitrite treatment. Nitrite treatment induces deamination of adenine, cytosine, and 5mC at different frequencies, producing inosine, uracil, and thymine, respectively. Meanwhile, nitrite treatment nitrosylates 6mA and 4mC, producing nitrosylated 6mA (6mA-NO) and nitrosylated 4mC (4mC-NO). During PCR amplification and sequencing, base pairing and reading for each product are labeled on the right column. <bold>b</bold> The workflow of NT-seq. Single-stranded DNA is first annealed with protective oligos to protect PCR primer regions. Annealed DNA is treated with nitrite and then amplified to construct the sequencing library. Sequencing data from native DNA and PCR control are used to calculate the A to G or C to T mutation ratio and to call methylation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13059_2022_2689_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par7">We first characterized the products formed from the reactions between nitrite and 2′-deoxyadenosine/2′-deoxycytidine by HPLC separation followed by mass spectrometric analyses. We found that the two nucleosides can indeed be deaminated upon subjected to nitrite treatment (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1–S4). More importantly, when subjecting 6mA and 4mC to the same nitrite treatment conditions, 6mA-NO and 4mC-NO were the dominant products and there were minimal side products formed from nitrite treatment (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S5–S8). Additionally, we performed time-dependent nitrite treatment to investigate the reaction dynamics of these four nucleosides. Consistent with published m<sup>6</sup>A results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], we found that 6mA and 4mC are converted to 6mA-NO and 4mC-NO more rapidly than the deamination of their unmethylated counterparts (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S9).</p>
      <p id="Par8">We then designed an experimental workflow to investigate whether nitrite treatment can be used to develop a sequencing method to simultaneously detect genome-wide all three types of methylation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). In the workflow, we hybridized two protective oligos, which is reverse complementary to the primer regions of the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) since Watson-Crick base pairing has been shown to protect DNA bases from deamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The quantitative PCR (qPCR) results showed that the protected DNA could be more efficiently amplified than unprotected DNA by decreasing the cycle threshold (<italic>Ct</italic>) value up to 7.5 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1). Since the deamination by nitrite treatment is completed through nitrite-mediated diazotization followed by hydrolysis which requires acidic conditions and relatively high temperature, the deamination efficiency is positively correlated to acid concentration, incubation temperature, and treatment duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, increasing these conditions such as treatment duration can also result in an increased level of DNA degradation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S10). Therefore, it is crucial to optimize the treatment condition to achieve a high deamination rate while preserving enough DNA for library preparation when applying it to genomic DNA. Therefore, we treated six pmol (~250 ng) protected DNA oligos with different concentrations of acetic acid, different temperatures, and different durations of treatment and performed qPCR to estimate the amount of remaining amplifiable fragments. Considering Ct around 15 as the required amount of amplifiable DNA for downstream library preparation, we determined 2.3% acetic acid, 1 M sodium nitrite (pH = 4.187), and incubation at 37 °C as our optimal condition (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2). We also evaluated the damage level caused by nitrite treatment using 293T genomic DNA and found that nitrite-treated DNA is less fragmented compared to bisulfite-treated DNA. However, the DNA degradation from nitrite treatment is more severe than bisulfite treatment (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S10).</p>
      <p id="Par9">To enable methylation detection in genomic DNA, it is also essential to efficiently align NT-seq reads to the reference genome. Therefore, we developed an NT-seq analysis pipeline that can tolerate all deamination-elicited base substitutions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S11). Since the base deamination will only cause transition mutations (A to G, C to T, or G to A) but not transversion mutations, we degenerate A/C/G/T bases in both reads and reference to purine/pyrimidine bases. Using whole-genome sequencing data from <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 as a mock dataset, we artificially introduced A to G, C to T, or G to A change to mimic the base changes after nitrite treatment. The unique alignment rate is very similar to the original unchanged reads, indicating the NT-seq analysis pipeline can tolerate all possible base changes introduced by nitrite treatment (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S11).</p>

      <title>Detection of 6mA, 4mC, and 5mC in oligonucleotides using NT-seq</title>
      <p id="Par10">To investigate the feasibility of NT-seq for DNA 6mA methylation detection, we performed pilot experiments with 6mA modified oligo and unmodified oligo. Consistent with previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], we found that at the 6mA position, the A to G ratio (the ratio between A to G frequency in modified/native sample and A to G frequency in unmodified/amplified sample) is about 18-fold lower than that in other adenine positions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). We further performed NT-seq on oligos mixed with different percentages of 6mA modified oligo and found that the normalized A to G frequency at the 6mA position is linearly correlated to the 6mA percentage (<italic>r</italic> = −0.968, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b), indicating that the NT-seq can quantify the 6mA frequency precisely.

      <p id="Par11">We then used BamHI methyltransferase to methylate double-strand DNA oligo with GGATCC motif for 4mC modification, as the 4mC modified DNA oligo is not commercially available. The BamHI restriction enzyme was used to cleave unmethylated DNA oligo before nitrite treatment (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S12). The NT-seq result showed that C to T ratio at the BamHI methylated sites is about 4-fold lower than other cytosine positions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). Additionally, we performed NT-seq on oligos mixed with different percentages of 4mC modified oligo and demonstrated the C to T ratio at both 4mC positions is linearly correlated to 4mC percentage (<italic>r</italic> = −0.988 for position 39 and −0.992 for position 42), indicating that NT-seq can also quantify 4mC frequency (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d, e). These results demonstrated that NT-seq indeed could detect 4mC and 6mA in parallel. Of note, the fold change of 4mC oligo is lower than 6mA oligo, which is likely caused by a small proportion of hemimethylated/unmethylated 4mC oligo that escaped from restriction enzyme cleavage.</p>
      <p id="Par12">As for detecting 5mC using NT-seq, we performed NT-seq on 5mC modified and unmodified oligos. The C to T ratio at the 5mC position is about 40% higher than other cytosine positions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f), consistent with a previous study showing that 5mC is easier to deaminate than C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. We also performed NT-seq on oligo mixture with different percentages of 5mC oligo and found that the C to T frequency is also linearly correlated to the percentage of 5mC (<italic>r</italic> = 0.972, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S12). This result further demonstrated that NT-seq could also detect 5mC quantitatively. Notably, unlike bisulfite sequencing, the impact of 4mC and 5mC is the opposite during nitrite treatment, making NT-seq capable of distinguishing 4mC and 5mC. Taken together, we demonstrated that NT-seq could detect all three types of DNA methylation in DNA oligos.</p>

      <title>Detection of methylation motifs in bacteria by NT-seq</title>
      <p id="Par13">To determine the capability of NT-seq in detecting three types of methylation motif in genomic DNA, we applied NT-seq to the <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 genome. Firstly, we found that A to G frequency at known 6mA sites (Dam (G6mATC) and M.EcoKI (A6mACN<sub>6</sub>GTGC and GC6mACN<sub>6</sub>GTT) motifs) was significantly decreased compared to unmethylated adenine sites, while no difference was observed after PCR amplification (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Thus, the A to G ratio at Dam and M.EcoKI motifs was significantly decreased compared to unmethylated adenine positions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). The M.EcoKII motif was used as a negative control because the methyltransferase M.EcoKII is known not to be expressed under standard laboratory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. As expected, the A to G ratio at the M.EcoKII motif is not different from other unmethylated adenine sites (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). To further demonstrate that NT-seq detects bona fide 6mA motifs, we applied NT-seq to <italic>hsdM</italic> (the gene encoding M.EcoKI protein) KO strain and <italic>dam/dcm</italic> mutated strain. In contrast to the WT <italic>E. coli</italic> strain, the M.EcoKI motif in the <italic>hsdM</italic> KO strain shows no difference in A to G ratio from other unmethylated adenine sites (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). Similarly, the A to G ratio difference between the Dam motif and unmethylated adenine is also lost in the <italic>dam/dcm</italic> mutated strain (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e).

      <p id="Par14">Next, we performed NT-seq on the <italic>H. pylori</italic> JP26 genome, which contains two known 4mC motifs: 4mCCGG and T4mCTTC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Consistent with 6mA results, the C to T frequency at these two 4mC motifs was decreased compared to unmethylated cytosine positions, while no difference was observed after PCR amplification (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). The C to T ratio at these two motifs decreased around 4-fold compared to unmethylated cytosine positions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f). As there is no known 4mC motif in <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655, we analyzed C to T ratio at 4mC sites identified by SMRT-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Consistent with the previous report, the C to T ratio at these sites showed no difference from other cytosine sites (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>g), indicating NT-seq can only detect true 4mC-induced difference. In contrast, the A to G ratio at 6mA sites identified by SMRT-seq was decreased 4-fold on average (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S13). These results are consistent with the previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] that SMRT-seq may overestimate the total level of 4mC or falsely detect some 4mC motifs in the bacterial genomes.</p>
      <p id="Par15">We compared C to T ratio at two known 5mC motifs in the <italic>H. pylori</italic> genome to examine whether NT-seq also detects 5mC motifs. Consistent with 5mC oligo results, the C to T ratio at these two known 5mC motifs is significantly increased compared to unmethylated cytosine sites (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>h). Similarly, the Dcm motif in <italic>E. coli</italic> also shows a significantly increased C to T ratio between native and PCR samples (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S13). The increase in C to T ratio is diminished in <italic>dam/dcm</italic> mutant, further indicating that the 5mC can be detected by NT-seq (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S13). Overall, we demonstrated NT-seq could be used to simultaneously detect multiple types of DNA methylation motif in bacteria genomes.</p>

      <title>De novo discovery of methylation motifs in bacteria using NT-seq</title>
      <p id="Par16">As we showed that NT-seq could detect known methylation motifs in bacteria, we further explored whether we could discover novel methylation motifs using NT-seq. We traversed all possible 4mer, 5mer, and 6mer adenine motifs in the <italic>H. pylori</italic> JP26 genome and found that the average A to G ratio of these motifs can be clearly divided into two groups (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S14). Most of the upper group are known 6mA motifs, and the lower group includes mainly unmethylated motifs with few exceptions. We further investigated these exceptions and found one sub-motif (GAGG6mA) of a previously reported motif (GMRG6mA) showed no difference in A to G ratio from other adenine motifs. In contrast, the other three sub motifs are significantly different from other adenine motifs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). The same pattern was observed in SMRT-seq results (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S14), demonstrating that previous SMRT-seq workflow imprecisely combined GAAG6mA and GCRG6mA into GMRG6mA.

A similar trend was also observed in the SMRT-seq IPD ratio quantification, demonstrating GGWCN6mA is an actual 6mA motif (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S14).

      <title>Methylation motif identification in microbial community reference using NT-seq</title>
      <p id="Par19">Meta-epigenomic analysis based on SMRT-seq has recently revealed diverse DNA methylation in an environmental microbial community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. To determine whether NT-seq can be used to detect DNA methylation patterns in microbial community samples, we applied NT-seq on a commercial microbial community standard, including eight bacteria species and two fungi species. Since the composition of two fungi genomes is about six times lower than other bacterial genomes, and there is no reported methylation motif in both fungi species, we focused our 6mA analysis on eight bacteria species. We traversed all possible 4mer, 5mer, 6mer, and common type I RM bipartite methylated adenine motifs. We confirmed that all 6mA motifs with a high IPD ratio from the previous SMRT-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] in seven bacteria strains are significantly different from unmethylated motifs in NT-seq (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S15, S16).

Consistently, the current signals from Nanopore sequencing showed minor changes at any position of CTKVAG or CTCCAG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. For <italic>Lactobacillus fermentum</italic>, which has no available SMRT-seq data, a putative 6mA motif: AG6mAGG showed a similar extent of decrease in A to G ratio compared to known 6mA motifs in other species (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). A to G ratio distribution of most sub motifs of AG6mAGG displayed clear separation from unmethylated motifs, suggesting it is a true 6mA motif (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S15). A previous study using 6mA DIP-seq failed to detect any 6mA peaks in the <italic>L. fermentum</italic> genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, we reanalyzed their 6mA DIP-seq data and found we were able to identify 1557 6mA peaks by keeping all “duplication” reads at the exact location but failed to detect any peaks after default deduplication. The reads “duplication” here can be caused by excessive sequencing depth (15.7 million reads on average for a 1.9 million genome) rather than true PCR duplicates. Further investigation of identified 1557 6mA peaks revealed 75% of total AG6mAGG motifs intersected with 6mA peaks (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d). Motif discovery analysis also identified AGAGG as the top significantly enriched motif inside these 6mA peaks (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d).

      <title>Profiling 6mA at single-base resolution in E. coli and Oxytricha genome by DIP-NT-seq</title>
      <p id="Par22">DNA 6mA is the most common methylation in prokaryotes. Recently, 6mA has been identified in eukaryotes, including mammals, in which DNA 6mA methylation is motif independent. To evaluate the performance of NT-seq in detecting different types of DNA methylation at the single-base resolution, we generated a Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for each methylation type in the <italic>H. pylori</italic> genome (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S17). Consistent with oligo results, the performance of NT-seq in detecting 6mA and 4mC at single-base resolution is similar (AUC = 0.934 for 6mA and 0.948 for 4mC at positions with more than 25× coverage). The performance is significantly decreased for 5mC detection (AUC = 0.832 at positions more than 25× coverage). To explore whether the performance of NT-seq in detecting methylation at single-base resolution can be further improved, we coupled 6mA DNA immunoprecipitation (6mA-DIP) with NT-seq and tested it in the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a). We sequenced both the unenriched whole-genome sample and 6mA-DIP-enriched sample to a near saturation depth as indicated by PCR duplication level (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S4). We found that without enrichment, NT-seq is unable to cover the whole set of the 6mA sites with high sequencing depth (25×, Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). However, with 6mA-DIP enrichment, NT-seq can cover roughly 3-fold more 6mA sites at the same sequencing depth threshold (25×, Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). This might be due to the DNA damage effect induced by nitrite treatment under acidic conditions. Previous studies showed that depurination in xanthine (generated from guanine deamination) is more rapid than other bases under acidic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Additionally, xanthine was reported to induce polymerase arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], which may lead to a PCR amplification bias for xanthine-free DNA fragments. Consistently, compared to untreated samples, nitrite treatment causes the final sequencing result to be more biased for G-poor regions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S18). Therefore, 6mA-DIP can eliminate reads from unmethylated G-poor regions and concentrate sequencing reads to methylation loci. Additionally, 6mA-DIP also enriched 6mA, as shown by a significant decrease of A to G ratio at Dam/M.EcoKI motif in unenriched sample when compared to enriched sample (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c). To comprehensively evaluate the performance of NT-seq in detecting 6mA sites, we generated the ROC curve of unenriched and DIP-enriched samples using Dam/M.EcoKI motif as the gold standard for 6mA positions. Consistently, DIP enrichment greatly improves the AUC scores at different sequencing depth thresholds (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d). Similar results were also observed in the PR curve and AP scores (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S18).

Furthermore, using Dam/M.EcoKI-mediated 6mA as the ground truth, DIP-NT-seq can detect up to 76.8% of the false-negative sites from SMRT-seq and only 0.3% of false-positive sites from SMRT-seq, indicating that DIP-NT-seq was able to efficiently filter false-positive 6mA identified from SMRT-seq. In addition to SMRT-seq, we also compared DIP-NT-seq to a few other next-generation sequencing-based methods for <italic>E. coli</italic> 6mA detection, such as 6mA DIP-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and 6mACE-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

When comparing to 6mACE-seq, we found that DIP-NT-seq can detect 7% more 6mA sites but DIP-NT-seq generates more false-positive sites (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S19). Overall, F1 score indicates DIP-NT-seq is slightly improved compared to 6mACE-seq (0.843 for DIP-NT-seq and 0.833 for 6mACE-seq). It is also worth noting that the performance of NT-seq in identifying true 6mA can be improved using a higher sequencing depth threshold (25X, F1 score: 0.911; 50X, F1 score: 0.953) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S18), indicating these incorrectly classified 6mA sites by NT-seq were likely caused by the low sequencing coverage at these sites, which can be solved by increasing the sequencing depth.</p>
      <p id="Par24">6mA has recently been described in various eukaryotic organisms, including unicellular eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], metazoans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. 6mA is generally more abundant in unicellular eukaryotes than metazoans. In <italic>Oxytricha trifallax</italic>, the abundance of 6mA is around 7000 ppm (parts per million dA), and MTA1c has been identified as a methyltransferase complex of 6mA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Although the 6mA DIP-seq is the primary approach for profiling 6mA in eukaryotic genomes, the specificity of this antibody-based method has been debated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. To determine whether NT-seq can improve the specificity and resolution of DIP-seq, we performed DIP-NT-seq in WT and MTA1 mutated <italic>Oxytricha</italic>. In agreement with 6mA DIP-seq and SMRT-seq results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], 6mA level in MTA1 mutant is about 50% less than WT <italic>Oxytricha</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>f–h), suggesting that DIP-NT-seq can robustly detect 6mA changes at single-base resolution in eukaryotic genomes. The SMRT-seq IPD ratio of 6mA detected by DIP-NT-seq is significantly higher than 6mA undetected by DIP-NT-seq (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>i), indicating that 6mA sites detected by DIP-NT-seq can be cross-validated in SMRT-seq.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par25">In this study, we developed NT-seq to map multiple types of DNA methylation genome-wide. We demonstrated that NT-seq could be used to detect all three major types of methylation motifs in bacterial genomes simultaneously. Notably, NT-seq can not only detect known methylation motifs but also be used to discover novel methylation motifs. We demonstrated that NT-seq could be used for de novo methylation motif discovery in single bacteria species and microbial communities. Furthermore, our results also indicate that coupling methyl DNA immunoprecipitation (DIP) and NT-seq can profile 6mA at single-base resolution in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. We demonstrated that the performance of DIP-NT-seq in the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome is comparable to SMRT-seq. Moreover, we demonstrated that DIP-NT-seq could filter out the false-positive 6mA sites from DIP-seq or SMRT sequencing, which raised the concerns for 6mA detection in the field. Therefore, NT-seq improves the accuracy of 6mA detection and supply an independent method that can be used for cross-validation with SMRT-seq.</p>
    <p id="Par26">While 6mA has been identified in eukaryotes, including mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], current 6mA genomic profiling in eukaryotes are mainly dependent on 6mA antibody-based DIP-seq. However, 6mA antibodies have recently been shown might generate non-specific signals when the abundance of 6mA is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In fact, Wu TP. et al. have reported the 6mA DIP-seq sensitivity limitation in 2016. By coupling 6mA DIP and NT-seq, the non-6mA fragments (false-positive source) will not generate different A to G ratios than PCR control in nitrite treatment. Thus, NT-seq can improve the specificity and resolution of 6mA DIP-seq by filtering out false-positive signals.</p>
    <p id="Par27">Here, we would also like to discuss a few limitations of NT-seq. Firstly, the current nitrite treatment in NT-seq causes DNA damage, which causes trouble for library generation and makes us unable to completely deaminate A and C to reach a better performance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, b; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S13). Secondly, we found that NT-seq reads are biased on G-poor regions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S18), which may limit the application of NT-seq in GC-rich bacterial genomes, although we took advantage of annealing two protective oligos on the PCR primer regions before nitrite treatment to preserve amplifiable DNA fragments and can generate the NGS library of most of the genomic DNA. In the bacterial genomes we tested, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> has the highest GC content (66.2%), and we did find a slightly noisier distribution of A to G ratio in different motifs, compared to other genomes with low GC content (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S15). Therefore, high GC content bacterial genome may require more input DNA to achieve identical performance than low GC content genomes. Lastly, the 5mC detection by NT-seq is less efficient than bisulfite sequencing. Thus, we recommend performing a shallow bisulfite sequencing to cross-validate the NT-seq-detected 5mC motifs for unknown genomes or microbial community samples. These limitations might be overcome by searching for a mild nitrite treatment condition to achieve near complete deamination rate while decrease the DNA degradation.</p>
    <p id="Par28">Collectively, NT-seq provides an efficient chemical-based method to reliably detect multiple types of DNA methylation in single bacteria, microbial communities, and eukaryotic genomes. Importantly, since NGS is much more affordable and easier to access than current third-generation sequencing platforms, NT-seq makes bacterial methylation analysis more accessible and cost-efficient for epigenetic researchers. Recently, Nanopore sequencing was shown to be able to detect multiple types of DNA methylation motifs in bacteria and microbiome. However, accurate methylation detection from Nanopore sequencing requires computational training with known methylation motifs sequencing in the different contexts, which are currently generated from the high-cost SMRT-seq. To aim for mammalian methylome profiling with Nanopore sequencing, more training datasets will be necessary for the success analysis model development. Recent developed computational tools like nanodisco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] are still insufficient to reliably detect 6mA motifs in mouse gut microbiome samples (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S20), largely limited by the small training dataset (only 28 known 6mA motifs trained <italic>versus</italic> hundreds of thousands of possible 6mA motifs in microbial genomes). Since we have shown that NT-seq can reliably detect multiple types of DNA methylation motifs, NT-seq can be used to generate more accurate and large-scale training datasets with minimal cost and help to develop machine-learning-based computational tools for methylation detection from Nanopore and other single-molecule sequencing.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p id="Par29">We developed a method (NT-seq) to simultaneously map all three major types of DNA methylation in prokaryotic genomes. NT-seq allows accurate detection of methylation motifs in both single species and microbial community samples. Compared to SMRT-seq, NT-seq provides a cost-efficient solution for bacterial methylation mapping, which will boost the study of bacterial epigenetics. By coupling methyl DNA immunoprecipitation (DIP), we showed that NT-seq could accurately profile 6mA at single-base resolution in bacterial genomes, which could also be applied to eukaryotic genomes to help eliminating the non-specific signals in 6mA DIP-seq in eukaryotes. NT-Seq can cross-validate SMRT-Seq results and generate more training datasets for developing machine-learning tools for methylation analysis. This method paves the way for further epigenetic study on genomic DNA 6mA in eukaryotes.</p>

Aliquots (10 μL each) were taken out from the reaction mixtures at the indicated time points. To the aliquots were added 10 μL of 2.0 M TEAA, and the mixture was subjected immediately to HPLC analysis on a Beckman Gold HPLC system. A reversed-phase C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm in particle size) was used for the separation. Mobile phases A and B were 50 mM triethylammonium acetate (pH6.8) and 30% acetonitrile in mobile phase A, respectively, and the flow rate was 0.8 mL/min.

All other oligos, including 5mC modified oligo (100 nt with one 5mC at position 52), were synthesized at Sigma. 4mC modified oligo (91bp) was generated by treating dsDNA oligo with BamHI methyltransferase (methylates GGATCC motif at the first cytosine base) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (NEB, M0223S). BamHI methyltransferase-treated dsDNA was further treated by BamHI-HF restriction enzyme according to the manufacturer instructions to eliminate DNA with incomplete 4mC methylation. DNA oligo was first annealed to the equal number of protective oligos at both ends in 0.2 M NaCl (95 °C for 2 min, 25 °C for 5 min, and held at 4 °C with ramp rate for temperature decreasing at 0.1 °C/s). In total, 20 pmol of annealed DNA was treated with 1 M sodium nitrite (NaNO<sub>2</sub>) and 2.3% (v/v) acetic acid (AcOH) at 37 °C for 4–5 h. Nitrite-treated DNA was purified using Oligo Clean &amp; Concentrator Kits (Zymo Research, D4060).
