      <p id="Par1">In computer-assisted synthesis planning (CASP) programs, providing as many chemical synthetic routes as possible is essential for considering optimal and alternative routes in a chemical reaction network. As the majority of CASP programs have been designed to provide one or a few optimal routes, it is likely that the desired one will not be included. To avoid this, an exact algorithm that lists possible synthetic routes within the chemical reaction network is required, alongside a recommendation of synthetic routes that meet specified criteria based on the chemist’s objectives. Herein, we propose a chemical-reaction-network-based synthetic route recommendation framework called “CompRet” with a mathematically guaranteed enumeration algorithm. In a preliminary experiment, CompRet was shown to successfully provide alternative routes for a known antihistaminic drug, cetirizine. CompRet is expected to promote desirable enumeration-based chemical synthesis searches and aid the development of an interactive CASP framework for chemists.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="Par2">Since the 1960s, several researchers have proposed computer-assisted chemical synthetic route designs. Various computer-assisted synthesis planning (CASP) programs have been developed to assist synthetic organic chemists in their work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. While expert systems and knowledge-based programs were the primary focus of CASP during the early stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], recent breakthroughs in the field of deep learning and widespread availability of reaction datasets have accelerated its development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In particular, data-driven approaches have received attention across research fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These approaches for multi-step synthesis planning have shown outstanding performance at every stage, and more recently, they have provided realistic and preferable synthetic routes.</p>
    <p id="Par3">The pioneers of CASP, Corey and Wipke, stated the following requirements related to the above strategy in their paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]: the program needs to provide as many useful routes as possible, chemists can decide the depth of search or analysis of the synthetic route, and the given routes are evaluated by the chemists. As discussed above, several CASP approaches have been developed; however, the majority of them have aimed to directly obtain the optimal chemical synthetic route rather than attempting to provide multiple route candidates. According to Corey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], examining as many useful chemical synthetic routes as possible is an essential part of retrosynthetic analysis. It is well known that evaluation criteria used for the presented synthetic routes depend on the chemist’s situation, objectives, and/or needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], such as the early-stage derivatization of hits, optimization of lead compounds, or large-scale synthesis of drug candidates. Thus, a desirable framework should provide as many useful routes as possible under specific conditions (e.g., room and high temperatures) and choose multiple reliable routes based on given situations (e.g., drug discovery or drug development stages).</p>
    <p id="Par4">As a framework for providing multiple reliable routes, Kowalik et al. have developed a promising approach using the Network of Organic Chemistry (NOC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and an enumeration algorithm of possible synthetic routes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The NOC consists of all possible molecules and reactions that represent links from reactants to products. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] The reactions are practically represented as templates that include the conditional/contextual rules of chemistry. Additionally, they implemented a recommendation system of multiple synthetic routes for a target molecule as follows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Firstly, they extracted the network of molecules and reactions (chemical reaction network) related to the target from the NOC. Secondly, they enumerated all possible synthetic routes from the chemical reaction network, and then, selected promising candidate routes. Although they showed a vast number of synthetic routes for some molecules and presented realistic solutions, their approach has two potential issues: the NOC is very large, and thus, uneconomical for obtaining optimal routes for a specific target molecule, and the enumeration algorithm does not always provide all possible routes. Hence, an efficient algorithm for constructing a chemical reaction network is required for practical application. Further, an exact enumeration algorithm without loss or duplication is needed for practical usage and finding reliable alternative routes.</p>
    <p id="Par5">In this study, we propose a CASP framework called “CompRet,” which enumerates possible synthetic routes using a novel enumeration algorithm with a theoretical guarantee, and then selects useful routes based on several score functions. CompRet implements the following three steps to recommend synthetic routes: (1) constructing a chemical reaction network based on the depth-first proof number search (DFPN) and template-based retrosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], without a large chemical reaction network such as the NOC, (2) enumerating all synthetic routes from the network using a novel algorithm, and (3) recommending multiple synthetic routes by developing a naive visualization method and simple score functions. DFPN was initially developed by Nagai et al. in the context of artificial intelligence for games such as Shogi and Go [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In application to CASP, it has shown superior or comparable performance to that of depth-first search or Monte Carlo tree search [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Therefore, DFPN was adopted to construct the chemical reaction network proposed herein. The number of possible synthetic routes provided by the enumeration may reach or exceed several millions. As it would be impossible for chemists to manually examine all of them, several score functions and a visualization method have been introduced into the framework to simplify the process.</p>
    <p id="Par6">Here, we report the development of CompRet and mathematically prove the completeness and soundness of the proposed enumeration algorithm, which can precisely enumerate all synthetic routes from a given constructed chemical reaction network. To demonstrate the approach, possible synthetic routes were found for cetirizine, an antihistaminic drug. In addition to sorting routes by scores, an embedding method to obtain an overview of millions of synthetic routes by defining a route fingerprint was attempted.</p>

      <title>Construction of chemical reaction network</title>
      <p id="Par9">A synthetic route for a target molecule can be represented as a tree-like structure in which molecule nodes (circles) and chemical reactions (rectangles) appear alternately, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>(a). In order to make a route feasible, the end molecule nodes (molecules in the blue circles in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>(a)) must consist of starting materials (e.g., commercially available molecules), and each synthesis step should be reasonable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>AND/OR representation of synthetic routes.<bold> a </bold>Example of a single synthetic route for cetirizine. Retrosynthetic computation is performed recursively from the topmost node (target) until it reaches to the starting materials at the bottom.<bold> b</bold> The synthetic route can be represented as an AND/OR tree in which the OR and AND nodes denote molecules and reactions, respectively.<bold> c</bold> A chemical reaction network ideally consists of all possible synthetic routes to a target (red sphere) molecule</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13321_2020_452_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par10">The chemical reaction network of a target molecule is typically large and can efficiently express (ideally all) possible synthetic routes to the target represented by the molecule and reaction nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In this study, we represent synthetic routes and chemical reaction networks as AND/OR trees, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>(b), to efficiently construct chemical reaction networks and precisely perform enumeration (see Additonal file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: for details on the AND/OR tree and chemical reaction network). The synthetic route in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>(a) is represented as the black route in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>(b) by expressing the molecule and reaction nodes as OR and AND nodes, respectively. The gray route in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>(b) shows another route to synthesize the same reactant. In an AND/OR tree, a molecule is represented as an OR node because either black “OR” gray routes are available to synthesize the same reactant, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>(b). On the other hand, a reaction is represented as an AND node because all the reactants (e.g., B “AND” C OR nodes in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>(b)) of the reaction (AND node A in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>(b)) are required to synthesize the product. Merging the molecule and reaction nodes that appear in different synthetic routes in this manner (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>(b)) enables an efficient representation of a large number of routes as a chemical reaction network (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>(c)).</p>
      <p id="Par11">CompRet efficiently constructs the chemical reaction network for a given target molecule based on DFPN, a search method based on the AND/OR tree using proof and disproof numbers for each node (see Additonal file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: for details on the DFPN algorithm). To design a synthetic route, reaction templates are applied to a target to transform it into reactants. For the retrosynthetic computation, Reactor version 20.11.0 (ChemAxon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]), which can consider stereochemistry in reaction templates, was used. The relevance of the transformed reactants was checked by computing the product of the template and the reactants. By recursively performing this transformation according to the DFPN algorithm, all possible synthetic routes for a target molecule can be obtained upon reaching the preset maximum depth <italic>md</italic>. The algorithm can design longer synthetic routes with a larger <italic>md</italic> value. Furthermore, CompRet repeatedly searches for a new route and merges it into a chemical reaction network (see the section 1 and 2, and Fig. S1 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: for details on the construction algorithm).</p>

      <title>Route ranking for recommendation</title>
      <p id="Par14">Three scoring functions were utilized for recommendation from the enumerated synthetic routes: the step-based method (STEP), mean synthetic complexity score (MSCS), and reference route-based method (REF). STEP is a simple method that outputs the longest number of synthesis steps for a given synthetic route. Synthetic complexity score (SCScore) was developed by Coley et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] to evaluate the complexity of the molecule. Like the SCScore, the MSCS for a synthetic route ranges from 0 to 5. As the SCScore of a molecule is directly proportional to the complexity of its synthesis, a molecule with a lower SCScore is preferred in synthesis planning. Here, MSCS is defined as the average of the SCScores of all molecules in a synthetic route. MSCS takes into account the complexity of intermediate molecules. REF is calculated only if a reference synthetic route is given. First, all the molecules that appear in the reference route are extracted and sorted by molecular weight. A list of sorted molecules is similarly prepared for a designed synthetic route. Then, the sum of fingerprint-based similarities between the sorted molecules of the reference and given routes is calculated. The RDKit fingerprint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and Tanimoto metrics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] were employed for this similarity evaluation. If the lengths of the sorted molecule lists differ, REF is set to 0. This score function is designed to find synthetic routes that are slightly different from the reference route, using the same number of intermediate molecules. Smaller STEP and MSCS values indicate a superior route, whereas REF is designed such that a larger value indicates a more desired route.</p>

      <title>Proof of enumeration algorithm</title>
      <p id="Par17">The proposed algorithm can enumerate all possible routes without loss or duplication from a given chemical reaction network of a target molecule. To prove this, it is necessary to show that (1) the algorithm outputs only synthetic routes, (2) there are no duplicate outputs, and (3) the algorithm outputs all synthetic routes in a given chemical reaction network. Here, these properties have been proven using the partition method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], which is widely used for enumeration algorithms, and mathematical induction. Details of these proofs are given in the Additonal file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. The properties (1), (2), and (3) are shown in Theorem 4.1, Lemma 4.1, and Theorem 4.2, respectively. The algorithm described in the literature reported by Kowalik et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] cannot count the number of synthetic routes accurately, as discussed in the Methods section.

The seventh and eighth columns show the generation time of the chemical reaction network and the calculation time of enumeration, respectively. It can be seen that the time for construction tends to be much longer than that for the enumeration of the chemical reaction network. This is because searching for applicable templates for a molecule, and then, using them to divide it into its substances are time-consuming tasks. Besides, enumeration from a larger and more complex network tends to require more time because the number of synthetic routes in a chemical reaction network increases combinatorially. It should be noted that the benchmark originally consists of 20 molecules, half of which remain unsolved. This would be because the reaction templates we used did not include the reactions or starting materials needed to solve the problems (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>

      <title>Route recommendation for cetirizine</title>
      <p id="Par21">To examine the synthetic routes designed by CompRet in detail, we have applied CompRet to cetirizine, a drug whose reported synthetic route is relatively simple [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Here, the results of changing the template set size and the maximum depth <italic>md</italic> are shown, followed by the routes recommended by CompRet using three scoring methods: REF, MSCS, and STEP. We also performed additional experiments for several molecules; the results are shown in Fig. S5 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. First, the construction of the chemical reaction network and the synthetic routes for different template set sizes (top 50, 100, and 500) were investigated. The value of <italic>md</italic> was fixed to six. Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows the time taken for the network constructions. The dotted line indicates that the first route has been found. Finding a single route for the top 100 (orange line) and 500 (green line) template cases required an extended period of time, because the number of candidate routes increased exponentially with the increase in the number of templates. The blue line shows the result for size 50. In this case, the network construction was completed in approximately 30 seconds. In the cases of size 100 and 500, the number of routes increased significantly; thus, enumeration was halted when the number of routes exceeded 1,500,000. In the case of size 500, the time taken to find 1,500,000 routes was less than 2,000 seconds.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Searched synthetic routes for cetirizine with different template sets.

      <p id="Par22">Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> shows the scattered routes with the t-SNE embedding of the obtained synthetic routes, respectively. For ease of viewing, 1,000 randomly sampled routes are shown for each template set size. Three synthetic routes sampled from the distant plot at the top of Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> have different respective starting materials and reactions. The distribution of the synthetic routes designed for size 50 does not seem to be a subset of those for size 100 because the total numbers of designed routes are different, but the sampled size is the same. Additionally, the precursors of cetirizine in the middle and left routes contain carboxylic acid, while the precursor in the reported route [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], shown as the black sphere route in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, contains carboxylate ester.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Sampled route distribution by t-SNE embedding.

The blue line in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> is the result for <italic>md</italic> = 4, where the chemical reaction network was constructed in less than 10 seconds, and 853 routes were obtained. The orange line is identical to that in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, that is, the result of construction with <italic>md</italic> = 6. Enumeration was halted when the number of routes exceeded 1,500,000. Figure S4 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> depicts the scattered routes explored with each <italic>md</italic> using t-SNE embedding and several examples of them.

      <p id="Par24">Finally, the results of route recommendation using the route scoring methods REF, MSCS, and STEP are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>. The figure illustrates several examples of synthetic routes recommended by these methods, explored using the top 500 templates and an <italic>md</italic> of 6. We also show the details of REF and MSCS distributions in Fig. S2 and S3, and Table S1 and S2 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. Compret successfully obtained the synthetic route reported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], denoted by the black sphere in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>. Using this known route as the reference for the REF methods, CompRet recommended the yellow route that changed chloride to bromine in the reference route. Its similarity score was the highest (6.32) among the enumerated routes. This result indicates that the REF method is suitable for finding routes similar to the reference route. Using MSCS, CompRet recommended the orange and purple routes, whose MSCS scores were 1.80 (lowest) and 2.28, respectively. The two routes are different from the reference route; thus, the MSCS method would have the potential to provide a variety of synthetic routes. Using STEP, CompRet recommended the red and light blue routes, whose number of steps was the smallest. The green route also has a smaller number of synthetic steps. While these routes had smaller numbers of synthetic steps, their starting materials and reactions differed. Consequently, the recommendation of routes that differed slightly from the known route, as well as diverse alternatives, demonstrates the effectiveness of the CompRet framework.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Examples of multiple synthetic routes for cetirizine recommended by CompRet.

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p id="Par25">In summary, we developed CompRet, a new recommendation framework for CASP. It consists of three parts: DFPN-based chemical reaction network construction of a given target, enumeration of synthetic routes from a given chemical reaction network, and recommendation from the enumerated synthetic routes. In this study, the DFPN algorithm, which was employed to search for synthetic routes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], is extended to construct a chemical reaction network. Furthermore, we have mathematically proven the validity of the enumeration algorithm. Since a chemical reaction network is built for the target compound each time, synthetic routes can be designed for the new compound as well. This algorithm works in general for a given appropriate chemical reaction network with a mathematical guarantee. CompRet was also applied to Heifets’ benchmark molecules and cetirizine. It was demonstrated to be able to construct chemical reaction networks, containing over a million routes in some cases, with a relatively small computational cost. Furthermore, the recommendation and visualization methods could be useful to suggest a wide variety of conceivable synthetic routes, from a slight deviation from the existing route to significantly different alternatives.</p>
    <p id="Par26">The current version of CompRet is not at the stage of practical use and has room for improvement as follows. Naively enumerating all synthetic routes leads to exponential growth of a chemical reaction network. Although the exponential growth is essentially difficult to overcome, parallel tree search algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] have the potential to hand this problem. In-scope filter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] or other graph pruning algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] will also provide solutions. As shown in the demonstration of chemical reaction network constructions, the explored synthetic routes depend on the template set and maximum depth <italic>md</italic>. The set of starting materials also affects the search results. Basically, CompRet can find a larger number of routes with a larger dataset and deeper depth setting. However, for practical applications, such a dataset and parameters should be determined adaptively based on the given case.</p>
    <p id="Par27">Further, template-based methods possess weaknesses such as computationally expensive subgraph isomorphism calculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In the future, it may be effective to construct chemical reaction networks by using refined template extraction methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], user-defined reaction templates, and template-free methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Although CompRet employs Reactor for retrosynthetic computation, other engines, such as RDChiral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], ASKCOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and RTSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], would be effective alternatives. This study only considered simple methods for route recommendation. Designing synthetic route evaluation metrics that are effective in all situations is a challenging task because critical aspects of route design depend on the chemist’s objectives and/or needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. However, various route evaluation methods, including SCScore with reformulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and other deep learning-based methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], have been proposed in recent years. If these methods are appropriately combined with CompRet, the customized framework could function as a user-friendly route recommendation system. The results obtained in this work are considered to be a successful example of bridging CASP and the field of discrete mathematics and developing an enumeration algorithm from a new perspective. This can enable the practical improvement of CASP through algorithmic techniques. Finally, to improve usability of the framework, we plan to provide the Docker image and the web application of CompRet.</p>
