      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Aptamers are short single-stranded RNA/DNA molecules that bind to specific target molecules. Aptamers with high binding-affinity and target specificity are identified using an <italic>in vitro</italic> procedure called high throughput systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (HT-SELEX). However, the development of aptamer affinity reagents takes a considerable amount of time and is costly because HT-SELEX produces a large dataset of candidate sequences, some of which have insufficient binding-affinity. Here, we present RNA aptamer Ranker (RaptRanker), a novel <italic>in silico</italic> method for identifying high binding-affinity aptamers from HT-SELEX data by scoring and ranking. RaptRanker analyzes HT-SELEX data by evaluating the nucleotide sequence and secondary structure simultaneously, and by ranking according to scores reflecting local structure and sequence frequencies. To evaluate the performance of RaptRanker, we performed two new HT-SELEX experiments, and evaluated binding affinities of a part of sequences that include aptamers with low binding-affinity. In both datasets, the performance of RaptRanker was superior to Frequency, Enrichment and MPBind. We also confirmed that the consideration of secondary structures is effective in HT-SELEX data analysis, and that RaptRanker successfully predicted the essential subsequence motifs in each identified sequence.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Aptamers are chemically-synthesized short single-stranded RNA/DNA molecules that can bind various targets with high binding affinity and specificity. Aptamers have mainly two characteristics that distinguish them from other nucleic acid drugs. First, aptamers recognize the tertiary structure of target molecules, while other oligonucleotide drugs target mRNA molecules through their primary structures only. Second, aptamers can target extracellular molecules as well as intracellular molecules. Unlike other nucleic acid drugs, aptamers can be generated against various types of target molecules such as transcription factors (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1–4</xref>), proteins and their complexes (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), small organic molecules (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), viruses (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and cells (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9–11</xref>). Moreover, aptamer production by chemical synthesis offers easy manufacturing, batch-to-batch reproducibility, and long shelf life. Considering these features, aptamers show potential as replacements of antibodies in analytical, diagnostic and therapeutic applications.</p>
    <p>Aptamers bind their targets by forming tertiary structures that provide spatial complementarity (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Therefore, it is important to consider the structural features (e.g. RNA secondary structures) of aptamers when predicting their binding properties. The information regarding the secondary structure is utilized in aptamer development strategies such as motif definition and strategic truncation (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), <italic>in silico</italic> screening to reduce initial pool size (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and searching the sequence space for potent aptamers (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Although a variety of software is available for predicting secondary structures of aptamers (e.g. (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>)), only few analyze secondary structure information for the calculation of binding potentials of RNA aptamers.</p>
    <p>Recently, aptamers with high binding-affinities were identified using HT-SELEX method (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). HT-SELEX is an <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental method that improves the conventional SELEX method (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) by including next generation sequencing (NGS) technology so that a larger amount of nucleotide sequence information can be processed. In (HT-)SELEX procedures, the aptamers with high binding-affinities are enriched by repeating the ‘Amplify only sequences that bind target’ procedure, starting with large amounts of random RNA/DNA sequences. First, an RNA/DNA pool with 10<sup>12</sup> to 10<sup>15</sup> random nucleotide sequences called round 0 pool (0R pool) or initial pool is generated. Then, high binding-affinity aptamers are identified by performing repeated rounds of a five-step procedure as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. In HT-SELEX method, aptamers obtained in not only the final round but also in some of the previous rounds including the 0R pool are sequenced. Since a vast number of sequences are generated by HT-SELEX (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23–25</xref>), an efficient candidate selection method is required to reduce the number of non-binding clones, decrease experiment time, and minimize material cost.</p>

    </fig>
    <p>There have been some previous <italic>in silico</italic> studies to identify the high binding-affinity sequences from HT-SELEX data by various analyses. Frequency, Enrichment (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), and MPBind (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) were developed to achieve this purpose by scoring and ranking the candidate sequences. Frequency calculates the frequency of appearance for each sequence. Enrichment calculates transition of frequency between consecutive rounds for each candidate sequence. MPBind performs statistical analysis based on changes in relative frequencies of all k-mer units. However, none of them includes aptamer structure data in their analyses. In contrast, AptaTRACE (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) traces the transition of secondary structure between HT-SELEX rounds for each k-mer and predicts the binding motif independent of frequency data. However, AptaTRACE does not provide a ranking for the candidates. APTANI<sup>2</sup> (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) ranks candidates and identifies relevant structural motifs through the calculation of a score that considers secondary structures of aptamers. However, the score focuses on structural stability rather than structural similarity. In addition, APTANI<sup>2</sup> uses only one round of HT-SELEX as its input.</p>
    <p>Another challenge in software development is that there are only a few public HT-SELEX datasets. In aptamer-related research, only the aptamers that show high binding-affinity are reported; research reports rarely disclose the complete (HT-)SELEX data generated throughout the selection process. In many cases, even when the sequence data is made available, only the data from the final round is shared and the data generated in intermediate rounds of HT-SELEX procedure is not available. It should also be noted that there is little information about the candidate sequences that turn out to lack binding activity. This data of ‘aptamers with low binding-affinity’ is highly valuable for evaluating the performances of <italic>in silico</italic> HT-SELEX analysis methods.</p>
    <p>Here we present RNA aptamer Ranker (RaptRanker), a novel <italic>in silico</italic> method for identifying high binding-affinity aptamers from HT-SELEX data by scoring and ranking. RaptRanker determines unique sequences from all HT-SELEX rounds and clusters all subsequences of unique sequences by similarity based on both nucleotide sequence and secondary structure features. Then, RaptRanker identifies high binding-affinity aptamers by calculating the average motif enrichment (AME), which is a score assigned to each unique sequence based on frequency of subsequence clusters. We performed two new HT-SELEX experiments and evaluated sequence sets that include aptamers with low binding-affinity using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay. In both HT-SELEX dataset analyses, performance of RaptRanker was superior to Frequency, Enrichment and MPBind.</p>

    <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
    <p>RaptRanker clusters the subsequences of unique sequences based on similarity in both nucleotide sequence and secondary structure. Then, RaptRanker assigns a score for each subsequence and each unique sequence using the cluster data. Finally, RaptRanker ranks all unique sequences by score (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Importantly, the score calculated by RaptRanker reflects particular characteristics of aptamers and SELEX experiment, such as nucleotide sequence similarity, secondary structure similarity, and frequency information.</p>

      <caption>
        <p>An illustration of RaptRanker algorithm. First, RaptRanker determines the sequences to be analyzed from all the input FASTA/FASTQ files of HT-SELEX experiments by filtering. Second, RaptRanker extracts unique sequences by removing duplicates, and computes sequence-structure profiles (SSPs) which represents both sequence and structure information. Third, RaptRanker determines subsequences of unique sequences, and constructs subsequence-structure profile (SSSP) by decomposing SSPs. Forth, RaptRanker clusters subsequences (from all the rounds) by constructing Minimum Spanning Forest (MSF), based on similar pairs of SSSPs calculated by SketchSort. Finally, sequence scores are computed based on clustering. Each cluster obtained by RaptRanker can be regarded as a motif because it is a collection of similar subsequences of nucleotide sequence and secondary structure.</p>
      </caption>
      <graphic xlink:href="gkaa484fig2"/>
    </fig>
    <p>Specifically, RaptRanker identifies high binding-affinity aptamers through the five steps shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>: (i) import of the sequence data from FASTA or FASTQ input file, (ii) determination of unique sequences by removing duplicates and computation of sequence-structure profiles (SSPs) representing nucleotide sequence and secondary structure features as predicted by CapR (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), (iii) derivation of subsequences sequentially from all unique sequences, and generation of sub-sequence-structure profiles (SSSPs) representing nucleotide sequence and secondary structure features for each subsequence, (iv) enumeration of all subsequence pairs matched based on similarity in sub-sequence-structure profiles using SketchSort (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and clustering of subsequences by constructing minimum spanning forest (MSF) from all similar subsequence pairs and (v) calculation of the scores and ranking unique sequences.</p>
    <p>The details of each step are described in the following sections (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref> for notations utilized below).</p>
    <sec id="SEC2-1">
      <title>Filtering</title>
      <p>RaptRanker determines sequences to be analyzed by two-step filtering. First, only the sequences whose primer-binding region is the same as the design are extracted. Then, the random regions whose length is within the user-defined limits are extracted. The sequences (i.e. the set of random regions) that pass the filtering criteria are subjected to further analyses.</p>
      <p>In the first filtering, the sequences from FASTA or FASTQ files are imported and only the sequences whose primer binding regions exactly matches the design are extracted. Both ends of sequences obtained from the SELEX experiment include fixed nucleotide sequences necessary for amplification by PCR method. These sequences are called forward primer binding region (5′ end) and reverse primer binding region (3′ end). RaptRanker extracts only the sequences whose both forward and reverse primer binding regions exactly match the user-defined parameters <italic>forward_primer</italic> and <italic>reverse_primer</italic>.</p>
      <p>In the second filtering, the random regions whose lengths are between the upper and lower limits are extracted. RaptRanker uses the user-defined parameters <italic>minimum_length</italic> and <italic>maximum_length</italic>, and extracts only the random regions whose lengths <italic>l</italic> are <inline-formula><tex-math id="M7">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

        <p>RaptRanker determines the unique sequences by removing duplicates present in the imported sequence dataset in advance to reduce the calculation cost. First, for each round, count the appearance of each sequence and remove duplicates with radix sort (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). After that, summarize the results of each round, and remove duplicates with radix sort again. This result is the unique sequences from all inputted HT-SELEX data, and each unique sequence has the frequency information on each round.</p>

      <title>Newly acquired experimental data in this study</title>
      <p>Because the number of existing datasets is not sufficient for evaluating our method, we performed two new HT-SELEX experiments, and selected evaluation sequence sets that include aptamers with low binding-affinity as determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay. The target molecules of HT-SELEX experiments were human recombinant transglutaminase 2 (TG2; Cat. No. 4376-TG) and human recombinant integrin alpha V beta 3 (αVβ3; Cat. No. 3050-AV). In the following, we refer the data from TG2 experiment as Data1, and the data from αVβ3 experiment as Data2. The sequence data are available on DRA009383 and DRA009384, and evaluation of sequence sets in each dataset are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Tables S4 and S5</xref>.</p>
      <p>TG2 and αVβ3 were purchased from R&amp;D systems. Z-Gln-Gly (Cat. No. C6154) and Hydroxylamine hydrochloride (Cat. No. 169417) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All other buffers and chemicals were of special grade.</p>

        <p>Selection of aptamers was followed by a previously-reported SELEX method (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) with some modifications. The sequence of the first template for Data1 and Data2 were <monospace>5′-TCACACTAGCACGCATAGG –30N– CATCTGACCTCTCTCCTGCTCCC-3′</monospace> and <monospace>5′-GAGGATCCATGTATGCGCACATA –40N– CTTCTGGTCGAAGTTCTCCC-3′</monospace>, respectively.

The oligonucleotide libraries containing 2′-fluoro-pyrimidine nucleotides were prepared by transcription using a mutant T7 RNA polymerase. The binding buffer used for selection contained 145 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.05% Tween20, and 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.6). For Data2 SELEX, 1 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub> was used instead of MgCl2. The recombinant proteins were immobilized on NHS-activated Sepharose (17-0906-01, GE Healthcare) and bound nucleotides were released with 6 M Urea. After selection, nucleotide pools were sequenced using an Ion PGM Hi-Q View Sequencing Kit (A30044, Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>

Aptamers were prepared in 16-merpoly(A)-tailed form by in vitro transcription. A 5′-biotinylated dT16 oligomer was bound to the surface of the streptavidin sensor chip (BR100531, GE Healthcare) of active and reference flow cells. The poly(A)-tailed RNA was immobilized to the active flow cell by complementary hybridization to the dT16 oligomer. The recombinant protein in the binding buffer was injected to both flow cells of the sensor chip. Data was obtained by subtracting the reference flow cell data from the active flow cell data. Maximum response after injection was used for determination of true binding clone. Experimental parameters, including material concentrations, flow rate, contact time, and criteria of true binding clone were optimized for each target (see Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). To regenerate the sensor chip, bound material was completely removed by injecting 6 M urea.

      <title>Comparison of performances for the identification of high binding-affinity aptamer</title>
      <p>To assess the performance of high binding-affinity aptamer identification, we compared ‘True Positive Rate (TPR) when False Positive Rate (FPR) is 0’ metrics of two HT-SELEX datasets. This evaluation metrics corresponds to the rise of the ROC curve, and it considers the practical use that the binding-affinity is experimentally confirmed only for high scoring sequences (details are on section ‘Evaluation metrics of binding affinity prediction performance’). Among the existing methods, Frequency and Enrichment were re-implemented and calculated by RaptRanker (Appendix ‘Calculating of Frequency and Enrichment’D).</p>
      <p>We compared each approach in the final round of both datasets. RaptRanker showed the highest TPR in both datasets. So, RaptRanker identified the high binding-affinity aptamers with the highest performance among all three methods tested (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Here, the result of MPBind in Data1 was 0.0. MPBind is a method that can use control-round (SELEX round without adding target molecules) information. However, in this case, control-round information is not available in both data sets. This may be have caused the low performance of MPBind.</p>

      <title>Validation of the effectiveness of analyzing both sequence and secondary structure</title>
      <p>We validated the effectiveness of considering both nucleotide sequence and secondary structure. We compared binding-affinity prediction performances in a manner similar to that explained in the previous section. We included three types of analyses; first one is the analysis based on sequence similarity only, second one on secondary structure similarity only, and the last one on both parameters.</p>
      <p>For analyses relying on sequence similarity only, we calculated Average K-mer Enrichment (AKE) in a similar way we calculated Average Motif Enrichment (AME) based on RaptRanker’s clustering (Appendix ‘Calculation of Average K-mer Enrichment (AKE)’H); AKE is calculated based on k-mer, which is a set of subsequences with matching nucleotide sequences, while AME is calculated based on cluster RaptRanker clusters. Here, we calculated AKE for 10-mer because we set <italic>wide</italic> = 10 in RaptRanker.</p>
      <p>As a method considering only secondary structure similarity, we calculated AME with <italic>weight</italic> = 0.0. By setting the parameter <italic>weight</italic> = 0.0, RaptRanker clusters the subsequences based on secondary structures similarity only. The AME calculated based on this clustering can be regarded as a score that predicts binding-affinity using secondary structure similarity only.</p>
      <p>We evaluated the performances of each approach using the data from the final rounds of both datasets. Data generated by the method of analyzing similarities in both sequence and structural features showed the highest TPR in both datasets (Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). In Data1, the analysis based on ‘<italic>structure</italic> similarity only’ and the analysis based on ‘both similarities’ showed the same TPR values. In contrast, in Data2, the analysis based on ‘<italic>sequence</italic> similarity only’ and the analysis based on both similarities showed the same TPR values. These results suggest that there are several types of HT-SELEX data, and that both sequence similarity and structure similarity should be considered in HT-SELEX data analysis. These results also suggest that RaptRanker is particularly useful in cases where the existing methods based on sequence similarity only cannot provide sufficient identification performance.</p>

However, short and discontinuous motifs such as those shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> A may affect the binding-affinity prediction performance of RaptRanker negatively because such discontinuous motifs are recognized as two different motifs in RaptRanker. Moreover, short motifs are harder to detect when the actual motif length is shorter than the value of <italic>wide</italic> in RaptRanker. Considering these shortcomings, it is conceivable that the binding affinity prediction performance of RaptRanker in Data2 did not improve as much as in Data1 due to presence of discontinuous and short motifs.</p>

        <title>Significance of clustering all subsequences simultaneously</title>
        <p>RaptRanker enables the computation of motif enrichment by clustering all subsequences obtained in all rounds simultaneously. That is, RaptRanker takes advantage of data generated in multiple rounds of HT-SELEX by clustering all subsequences at once.</p>
        <p>In the case of clustering all subsequences at once, clustering is not affected differences among rounds even if ‘Subsequences from sequences not observed in some rounds’ are present. RaptRanker determines all unique sequences <italic>S</italic> from all rounds, and clusters all their subsequences <italic>P</italic>. In this case, those subsequences only affect the calculation of motif frequency and motif enrichment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).</p>

            <p>(<bold>A</bold>) In the case of clustering subsequences from all rounds simultaneously, the clustering is not affected by differences among rounds even if ‘Subsequences from sequences not observed in some rounds’ are present. (<bold>B</bold>) In the case of clustering subsequences on each round, it is necessary to follow individual clusters across rounds. In this case, cluster fragmentation or integration may occur between rounds.</p>
          </caption>
          <graphic xlink:href="gkaa484fig6"/>
        </fig>
        <p>In contrast, in the case of clustering subsequences on each round, it is necessary to follow individual clusters through rounds. Cluster fragmentation or integration may occur between rounds in some cases. Such events make cluster mapping and computation of motif enrichment difficult (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Since RaptRanker clusters all subsequences from all rounds simultaneously, it can track the transition of motif frequency and compute motif enrichment. As an example, we visualized the transition of motif frequency for the motifs shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A and B (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The motif on Data1 is not observed in rounds 0 to 2, but it was highly enriched between rounds 3 and 4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). In contrast, the motif in Data2 was enriched smoothly between rounds 3 and 6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>).</p>

        <title>Evaluation metrics of binding affinity prediction performance</title>
        <p>We used TPR when FPR is 0 as the metric for evaluation of binding-affinity prediction performance. This metric is based on the approach of ROC enrichment (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). ROC enrichment is used for evaluation of protein-ligand virtual screening and calculated by dividing TPR by FPR. According to Jain and Nicholls, ROC enrichment should be reported in four points of FPR = {0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%, 5.0%} (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). However, since there are few negative aptamers in both datasets, the FPR is 7.1% (Data1) and 8.3% (Data2) when False = 1. So, we used the TPR when FPR is 0 as an alternative metric.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="SEC3-4-3">
        <title>Analysis with ROC curves</title>
        <p>The analysis using ROC curve is another way for evaluating binding affinity prediction performance. For the data analysis in section ‘Comparison of performances for the identification of high binding-affinity aptamer’, the ROC curves for data from rounds 0 to 4 in Data1 are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref> and the ROC curves for Data2 are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>, respectively. ROC curves corresponding to analysis in section ‘Validation of the effectiveness of analyzing both sequence and secondary structure’ are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>. In addition, the ROC curves for data for rounds 0 to 8 in Data1 are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>.</p>
        <p>Here, ROC curves for data from rounds 0 to 3 in Data1 and round 3 in Data2 are not shown because they were not informative. In these rounds, AME and Enrichment scores were undefined because these scores calculate relative increase of frequency compared to the previous round (Equation <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="M5">5</xref> and Equation S2) and in these instances either no previous round was present or the sequence was not observed in the previous rounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Tables S6 and S7</xref>). In other words, unless a sequence is observed in successive rounds, AME and Enrichment scores are undefined and the ROC curve is almost a diagonal line. For the same reason, AME and Enrichment values for round 4 data in both Data1 and Data 2 were undefined for some sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S6a and S7a</xref>).</p>
        <p>Besides, since the ROC curves obtained for analysis with RaptRanker and all the existing methods were below the diagonal line for data from rounds 5 to 8 in Data1, we only used data from rounds 0 to 4 for analysis. We also confirmed significant amplification of the unique sequences whose binding-affinity is False data from rounds 5 to 8 in Data1. Frequency, Enrichment, MPBind, and RaptRanker take frequency information into account, so if the False sequences were amplified significantly in the experiment, they are ranked higher. The amplification of the False sequences in Data1, rounds 5–8 might be caused by some experimental errors.</p>

        <title>Compare sequence score definitions</title>
        <p>As AME is defined as the average motif enrichment of the subsequences from each unique sequence, we can consider best motif enrichment (BME) as the maximum value of motif enrichment.

        <p>AME assesses the conservation of features over a wider range, whereas BME assesses the conservation of features locally. Since AME is the average, ‘unique sequences whose nucleotide sequence and secondary structure are conserved as a whole’ receive higher scores. In contrast, since BME takes the maximum value, ‘unique sequences whose nucleotide sequence and secondary are conserved in a specific part’ receive higher scores.</p>
        <p>We compared AME and BME for the data from the final rounds in both datasets. AME showed higher TPR than BME in Data1 (Table <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). The ROC curve is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>. These results indicate that the dataset to be analysed highly influences the score obtained by either AME or BME. However, AME is more convenient than BME in identifying high-binding affinity sequences because multiple unique sequences that share the same high-score motif have the same BME scores.</p>

        <title>Effect of parameters</title>
        <p>We examined the effects changing the values of <italic>wide</italic>, <italic>weight</italic> and <italic>cosdist</italic> on the performance. We used the parameters (<italic>wide</italic> = 10, <italic>weight</italic> = 0.5, <italic>cosdist</italic> = 0.001, <italic>missing_ratio</italic> = 0.00001) on RaptRanker for both data. and observed that <italic>wide</italic>, <italic>weight</italic> and <italic>cosdist</italic> greatly affected the clustering result. Since the clustering of RaptRanker uses SketchSort, which is an approximation algorithm, we measured the TPR when FPR is 0 for each combination of parameters three times and calculated the average.</p>
        <p>The parameters used in this study showed high TPR on average for both datasets, and no significant change in the results was observed when parameters were modified in a range (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Tables S8 and S9</xref>).</p>

        <title>Future works</title>
        <p>RaptRanker calculates scores for each round and each unique sequence. As a result, RaptRanker, just like the existing methods, cannot detect <italic>bad</italic> rounds (such as rounds 5–8 in Data1). Since RaptRanker uses data from all rounds as the input, we are planning to realize identification of high binding-affinity aptamers in the presence of <italic>bad</italic> rounds.</p>
        <p>In the clustering method of RaptRanker, features of subsequences are transformed into sub-sequence-structure profiles (SSSPs), which are clustered using SketchSort and MSF. Since SSSPs need only a matrix of real values, various extensions are possible. For example, RaptRanker can identify DNA aptamers by using DNA secondary structure prediction software instead of CapR. Alternatively, RaptRanker can add new features like G-quadruplex (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) by adding new rows to SSSPs. Generally, this clustering technique can be applied to identification of nucleic acid motifs not only in aptamers but also in non-coding RNAs and/or messenger RNAs. In particular, compared to general <italic>k</italic>-mer analysis, it is more effective in searching long motifs.</p>
        <p>In this study, conventional secondary structures were utilized; however, by considering tertiary structures, which play more important roles in target recognition, in the RaptRanker algorithm, its accuracy could be improved. There are many studies about tertiary structure predictions of RNAs (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36–38</xref>), and our future work includes the development of an efficient method to incorporate tertiary structure information into RaptRanker.</p>

    <title>CONCLUSION</title>
    <p>We developed RaptRanker, a novel <italic>in silico</italic> method for identifying high binding-affinity aptamers from HT-SELEX data based on local sequence and structural information. RaptRanker determines unique sequences by analyzing data obtained in <italic>all</italic> HT-SELEX rounds, and clusters all subsequences of unique sequences based on similarity in both nucleotide sequence and secondary structure features. Then, RaptRanker identifies high binding-affinity aptamers by calculating AME, which is a score for each unique sequence based on inclusion of clusters.</p>
    <p>To evaluate the performance of RaptRanker in identifying high binding-affinity aptamers, we performed two new HT-SELEX experiments, and evaluated sequence sets that include aptamers with low binding-affinity as detected by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay. The sequence data which includes the intermediate rounds and evaluation sequence sets are freely available, which will be useful in future aptamer researches.</p>
    <p>In both HT-SELEX datasets, RaptRanker showed the best performance in identifying high binding-affinity sequences among all methods tested: Frequency, Enrichment, and MPBind. Moreover, we confirmed the effectiveness of including both nucleotide sequence and secondary structure data in HT-SELEX analysis by examining the identification accuracy of different approaches based on similarity in (i) nucleotide sequence only, (i) secondary structure only, or (iii) both parameters. In addition, we confirmed that RaptRanker correctly predicts the essential subsequence in each identified sequence. RaptRanker is particularly useful when the existing methods analyzing sequence similarity only cannot provide sufficient identification.</p>
