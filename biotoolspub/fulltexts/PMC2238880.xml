    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the National Institutes of Health was created in 1988 to develop information systems for molecular biology. In addition to maintaining the GenBank(R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) nucleic acid sequence database, to which data is submitted by the scientific community, NCBI provides data retrieval systems and computational resources for the analysis of GenBank data as well as a variety of other biological data. For the purposes of this article, the NCBI suite of database resources is grouped into three broad categories; recent developments, resource highlights and a synopsis of the remaining NCBI resources. All resources discussed are available from the NCBI home page at (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>). In most cases, the data underlying these resources is available for download at (ftp.ncbi.nih.gov), a link from the NCBI home page.</p>

    <title>RECENT DEVELOPMENTS</title>
    <sec>
      <title>The Database of Genotype and Phenotype (dbGaP)</title>
      <p>The correlation of genetic and environmental factors with human disease is vital to the development of diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. Large-scale genotype studies that provide the data for such analysis run the gamut from genome-wide association surveys, medical sequencing, molecular diagnostic assays and surveys of association between genotype and non-clinical traits. The Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gap">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gap</ext-link>) was recently created at NCBI to archive, distribute and to support submission of data that correlates genomic characteristics with observable traits. This database is an approved NIH repository for genome wide association study (GWAS) results (grants.nih.gov/grants/gwas/index.htm).</p>
      <p>To protect the confidentiality of study subjects, dbGaP accepts only de-identified data and requires investigators to go through an authorization process in order to access individual-level data. Summary metrics for phenotype measures and genotype frequencies, as well as study documents protocols and subject questionnaires are available without restriction.</p>
      <p>Authorized access data distributed to primary investigators for use in approved research projects includes de-identified phenotypes and genotypes for individual study subjects, pedigrees and some pre-computed associations between genotype and phenotype. The results of several studies, including the National Eye Institute Age-Related Eye Disease Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), the NINDS Parkinsonism Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), the NHLBI Framingham SHARe and GAIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) were released by dbGaP in 2007.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>New BLAST databases</title>
      <p>Two new Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) databases, one for human and one for mouse, were launched over the past year containing a combination of RefSeq transcript and RefSeq genomic sequences arising from NCBI annotations. Searches of the two databases generate a new, interactive tabular display that partitions the BLAST hits by sequence type—genomic or transcript—and allows sorting by BLAST score, percent of query sequence in the alignment, or percent identity within the alignment. Human and mouse ‘genomic + transcript’ MegaBLAST searches use a faster, indexed algorithm that typically reduces run time by two-thirds. The pre-indexed database has been filtered to eliminate matches to low-complexity and repeat sequences.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>BLAST home page redesign</title>
      <p>The BLAST homepage has been redesigned to provide easier navigation and simplified BLAST program selection. The new page highlights options for genomic searches, features automatic parameter optimization for searches with short queries and uses an auto-complete input box for specifying organism limitations. Using the new homepage, users can assign titles to their BLAST searches, review recent BLAST search results and save BLAST forms with custom parameters for indefinite periods via My NCBI. As part of the redesign, BLAST Request Ids (RIDs) have been shortened from 36 to 11 characters.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Short Read Archive</title>
      <p>The past year has seen a massive increase in sequencing data generated from a new generation of sequencers, including those from Roche-454 Life Sciences, Illumina Solexa and Applied Biosystems SOLiD. This motivated development of the Short Read Archive (SRA) to accommodate deposits from sequencing experiments using these platforms. The SRA recently entered service and currently holds data from 44 studies.</p>
      <p>The SRA offers more extensive associations than can be tracked within the Entrez system by separating the representation of study, experiment and sample parameters from actual instrument data. Indexing of these objects will allow for the presentation of a complete pipeline of scientific results going from instrument data all the way through publication. Auxiliary tools for searching short-read data and for visualizing multiple and pair-wise reference alignments are expected to appear in the coming year.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Entrez Nucleotide database is split to become CoreNucleotide, EST and GSS</title>
      <p>An important change in Entrez over the past year is the split of the Nucleotide database into three subset databases called ‘CoreNucleotide’, ‘EST’ and ‘GSS’ (specified as ‘nuccore’, ‘nucest’ and ‘nucgss’, respectively, within the E-Utilities). The CoreNucleotide database contains records for all Entrez Nucleotide sequences that are not found within the Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) or Genome Survey Sequence (GSS) divisions of GenBank. These include sequences from all remaining divisions of GenBank, NCBI Reference Sequences (RefSeqs), Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) sequences, Third Party Annotation (TPA) sequences and sequences imported from the Entrez Structure database. The EST database contains all records found within the EST division of GenBank. EST records contain first-pass single-read cDNA sequences and include no annotated biological features. The GSS database contains all records found within the GSS division of GenBank. GSS records contain first-pass single-read genomic sequences and rarely include annotated biological features. The partitioning of the Nucleotide database makes it easier for researchers to focus on the segment of interest by separating the most richly annotated sequences from those that are sparsely annotated. During a transition period, searches of the Nucleotide database on the Web will return links to search results in the three subsets. However, the Nucleotide database on the web will eventually be phased out entirely in favor of the three subset-databases. The Nucleotide database will be retained for E-Utility use.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Protein Clusters</title>
      <p>The new Entrez Protein Clusters database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?</ext-link>db=proteinclusters), contains over 222 000 sets of almost identical RefSeq proteins encoded by complete prokaryotic or chloroplast genomes and organized in a taxonomic hierarchy. These clusters are used as a basis for genome-wide comparison at NCBI as well as to provide simplified BLAST access, via Concise Microbial Protein BLAST (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/prokhits.cgi">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/prokhits.cgi</ext-link>). Protein Clusters provides annotation information, publications, domains, structures and external links and analysis tools including multiple alignments. Protein Clusters are also linked to genomic neighborhoods via Genome ProtMap (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/protmap.cgi?">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/protmap.cgi?</ext-link>), which maps each protein from a COG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) or VOG (Viral Orthologous Groups) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/VIRUSES/vog.html">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/VIRUSES/vog.html</ext-link>) back to its genome, and displays the genomic segments coding for members of its group of related proteins.</p>

    <title>HIGHLIGHTED RESOURCES</title>
    <sec>
      <title>PubChem</title>
      <p>PubChem is the informatics backbone for the NIH Roadmap Initiative on molecular libraries and focuses on the chemical, structural and biological properties of small molecules, particularly their application as diagnostic and therapeutic agents. A suite of three Entrez databases, PCSubstance, PCCompound and PCBioAssay, contain the substance information, compound structures and bioactivity data of the PubChem project. The databases comprise records for over 19.6 million compounds with over 11 million unique structures. The PubChem databases link not only to other Entrez databases such as PubMed and PubMed Central but also to Entrez Structure and Protein to provide a bridge between the macromolecules of genomics and the small organic molecules of cellular metabolism. The PubChem databases are searchable using, in addition to text queries, structural queries based on chemical Smiles, formulas or 3D chemical structures provided in a variety of formats. An online structure-drawing tool (pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/search.cgi) provides a simple way to construct a structure-based search.</p>

      <title>Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)</title>
      <p>GEO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) is a data repository and retrieval system for microarray and other forms of high-throughput molecular abundance data generated by the scientific community. In addition to gene expression data, GEO accepts array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) data, chromatin immunoprecipitation on array (ChIP-chip) data, SNP array data and some proteomic data types. The GEO repository accepts Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment (MIAME)-compliant data submissions. Several data deposit options and formats are supported, including web forms, spreadsheets, XML and Simple Omnibus Format in Text (SOFT). Data may be queried and visualized from both experiment (Entrez GEO DataSets) and gene-centric (Entrez GEO Profiles) perspectives. At the time of writing, the repository contains data from over 200 000 hybridization experiments, representing ∼10 billion individual measurements, derived from about 4000 array definitions, and spanning over 400 organisms.</p>

    <sec>
      <title>Influenza Genome Resources</title>
      <p>The Influenza Genome Sequencing Project (IGSP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) is providing researchers with a growing collection of virus sequences essential to the identification of the genetic determinants of influenza pathogenicity. To date, the project has generated almost 24 000 influenza sequences. NCBI's Influenza Virus Resource links the IGSP project data, via PubMed, to the most recent scientific literature on influenza as well as to a number of online analysis tools and databases. These databases include NCBI's Influenza Virus Sequence Database, comprised of almost 50 000 influenza sequences in GenBank and NCBI's RefSeq database. Using the tools of the Influenza Virus Resource, researchers can extend their analyses to the 56 000 influenza protein sequences, 111 influenza protein structures, and 269 influenza population studies accessible within the biological databases covered by NCBI's Entrez system. An online influenza genome annotation tool analyzes a novel sequence and produces output in a ‘feature table’ format that can be used by NCBI's GenBank submission tools such as ‘tbl2asn’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>The Conserved CDS database (CCDS)</title>
      <p>Model organism gene predictions made by various groups using different methods result in annotations that are similar but not always identical. These differences often make it difficult for researchers to relate sequence information obtained for a gene in one database with information in another. Among the model organisms, the human and mouse genome sequences are now sufficiently stable that the identification of a set of ‘consensus’ gene annotations is feasible. The CCDS project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CCDS/">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CCDS/</ext-link>) is a collaborative effort among NCBI, the European Bioinformatics Institute, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) to identify a set of human and mouse protein coding regions that are consistently annotated and of high quality. To date, the CCDS database contains some 18 000 human and 13 000 mouse CDS annotations. The web interface to the CCDS allows searches by gene or sequence identifiers and provides links to Entrez Gene, record revisions histories, transcript and proteins sequences, and gene views in Map Viewer, the Ensemble Genome Browser, the UCSC Genome Browser and the Sanger Institute Vega Browser. The CCDS sequence data is available at (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/CCDS/">ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/CCDS/</ext-link>).</p>

        <title>Entrez, My NCBI and the Entrez Programming Utilities</title>
        <p>Entrez (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) is an integrated database retrieval system that supports text searching, using simple Boolean queries, of a diverse set of 35 databases that together comprise well over a quarter of a billion records. In their simplest form, these links may be cross-references between a sequence and the abstract of the paper in which it is reported, or between a protein sequence and its coding DNA sequence or its 3D-structure. Computationally derived links between ‘neighboring records’ such as those based on computed similarities among sequences or among PubMed abstracts, allow rapid access to groups of related records. A service called LinkOut expands the range of links to include external services, such as organism-specific genome databases. The records retrieved in Entrez can be displayed in many formats and downloaded singly or in batches.</p>
        <p>‘My NCBI’ allows users to store personal configuration options such as search filters, LinkOut preferences and document delivery providers. My NCBI also saves searches and can automatically e-mail updated search results. A My NCBI feature called ‘Collections’ allows users to save search results and bibliographies indefinitely. BLAST parameter sets may also be saved indefinitely using an option on the newly redesigned BLAST pages, described subsequently.</p>
        <p>Scripted access to Entrez is provided by the Entrez Programming Utilities (E-Utilities), a suite of eight server-side programs supporting a uniform set of parameters used to search, link between and download from, the Entrez databases. The ‘einfo’ utility can be used to retrieve lists of supported databases and search fields. The ‘egquery’ utility returns the number of matches to a query in each Entrez database. E-Utilities such as ‘efetch’ or ‘esummary’, are used to retrieve full records or summaries, respectively. Espell checks spelling within Entrez queries and offers corrections. A Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) interface to the E-Utilities is supported. Instructions for using the E-Utilities are found under the ‘Entrez Tools’ link on the NCBI home page.</p>

        <title>PubMed and PubMed Central</title>
        <p>The PubMed database passed a milestone over the past year, indexing its 17 millionth citation and providing full-text links to some 8.7 million articles. PubMed covers more than 19 600 life science journals for biomedical articles back to the 1950s, most with abstracts and many with links to the full-text article. PubMed is heavily linked to other core Entrez databases, where it provides a crucial bridge between the data of molecular biology and the scientific literature. PubMed records are also linked to one another within Entrez as ‘related articles’ on the basis of computationally detected similarities using indexed Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) terms and the text of titles and abstracts. The default ‘AbstractPlus’ display format shows, in addition to the abstract of a paper, succinct descriptions of the top five related articles, increasing the potential for the discovery of important relationships.</p>
        <p>PubMed Central (PMC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), a digital archive of peer reviewed journals in the life sciences, also recently passed a milestone by adding its 1 millionth full-text article, growing by 47% over the past year. More than 340 journals, including <italic>Nucleic Acids Research</italic>, deposit the full text of their articles in PMC. Participation in PMC requires a commitment to free access to full text, either immediately after publication or within a 12-month period. All PMC free articles are identified in PubMed search results and PMC itself can be searched using Entrez.</p>

    <title>THE BLAST FAMILY OF SEQUENCE-SIMILARITY SEARCH PROGRAMS</title>
    <p>The BLAST programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16">14–16</xref>) perform sequence-similarity searches against a variety of databases, returning a set of gapped alignments with links to full database records, to UniGene, Gene, the MMDB or GEO. One variant, BLAST2Sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), compares two DNA or protein sequences and produces a dot-plot representation of the alignments. The basic BLAST programs are also available as standalone command line programs, as network clients, and as a local Web-server package at (ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/executables/LATEST/).</p>
    <sec>
      <title>BLAST output formats</title>
      <p>Standard output formats include the default pairwise alignment, several query-anchored multiple sequence alignment formats, an easily-parsable Hit Table and a taxonomically organized output. A ‘Pairwise with identities’ mode better highlights differences between the query and a target sequence. A Tree View option for the Web BLAST service creates a dendrogram that clusters sequences according to their distances from the query sequence. Each alignment returned by BLAST is scored and assigned a measure of statistical significance, called the Expectation Value (E-value). The alignments returned can be limited by an E-value threshold or range.</p>

      <title>MegaBLAST</title>
      <p>MegaBLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), designed to find nearly exact matches, is available through a web interface that handles batch nucleotide queries and operates up to 10 times faster than standard nucleotide BLAST. MegaBLAST is the default search program for NCBI's Genomic BLAST pages, is used to search the rapidly growing Trace Archive and is available for the standard BLAST databases as well. For rapid cross-species nucleotide queries, NCBI offers Discontiguous MegaBLAST, which uses a non-contiguous word match (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) as the nucleus for its alignments. Discontiguous MegaBLAST is far more rapid than a translated search such as blastx, yet maintains a competitive degree of sensitivity when comparing coding regions.</p>

Summaries, including protein RefSeq accession numbers, Entrez Gene IDs, lists of interacting amino acids, brief descriptions of interactions, keywords and PubMed IDs for supporting journal articles are presented at (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/HIVInteractions/index.html">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/HIVInteractions/index.html</ext-link>). All protein–protein interactions documented in the HIV Protein-Interaction Database are listed in Entrez Gene reports in the HIV-1 protein interactions section.</p>

    <title>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION</title>
    <p>The resources described here include documentation, other explanatory material and references to collaborators and data sources on the respective Web sites. The NCBI Handbook, available in the Books database, describes the principal NCBI resources in detail. Several tutorials are also offered under the Education link from NCBI's home page. A Site Map provides a comprehensive table of NCBI resources, and the About NCBI feature provides bioinformatics primers and other supplementary information. A user-support staff is available to answer questions at (<email>info@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</email>). Updates on NCBI resources and database enhancements are described in the NCBI News newsletter (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/About/newsletter.html">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/About/newsletter.html</ext-link>). In addition, a number of mailing lists provide updates on a variety of NCBI resources (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sitemap/Summary/email_lists.html">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sitemap/Summary/email_lists.html</ext-link>). RSS feeds for some NCBI resources (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/feed/">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/feed/</ext-link>) are also now available, including a new RSS feed, ‘ncbi-announce’ that broadcasts a variety of NCBI updates including announcements of upcoming NCBI training courses.</p>
