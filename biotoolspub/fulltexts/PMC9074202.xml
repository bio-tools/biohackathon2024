        <p id="Par1">Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs formed by pre-mRNA back-splicing, which are widely expressed in animal/plant cells and often play an important role in regulating microRNA (miRNA) activities. While numerous databases have collected a large amount of predicted circRNA candidates and provided the corresponding circRNA-regulated interactions, a stand-alone package for constructing circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions based on user-identified circRNAs across species is lacking.</p>

We further employ CircMiMi to identify circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions based on the circRNAs collected in NeuroCirc, a large-scale database of circRNAs in the human brain. We construct circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions comprising differentially expressed circRNAs, and miRNAs in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and cross-species analyze the relevance of the targets to ASD. We thus provide a rich set of ASD-associated circRNA-miRNA-mRNA axes and a useful starting point for investigation of regulatory mechanisms in ASD pathophysiology.</p>

    <title>Background</title>
    <p id="Par15">Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of long non-coding RNAs produced by pre-mRNA back-splicing with a distinct single-strand, non-polyadenylated circular loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. They were observed to be more stably expressed than their corresponding co-linear mRNA isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Genome-wide analyses of high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that circRNAs were abundant in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Some circRNAs are evolutionarily conserved in terms of both circle sequence and expression across mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The best understood function of circRNAs is the regulatory role in regulating microRNA (miRNA) activities, with either miRNA sponges or scaffolds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Accumulating evidence shows that circRNA-miRNA regulatory axes can involve in cancer-related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and neurobiological pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], suggesting the potential implications of circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory pathways in pathophysiology of human diseases.</p>
    <p id="Par16">Nowadays, numerous tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] have been developed for identification and analysis of circRNAs, providing a large amount of publicly accessible circRNA resources. However, there are great discrepancies among the circRNA candidates identified by different circRNA detectors, implying the uncertainty of detected circRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Indeed, a considerable number of circRNAs detected by many currently-available tools were still derived from ambiguous alignments with an alternative co-linear explanation or multiple hits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It is worthwhile to reexamine the alignment ambiguity of the circRNAs for further analyses. In terms of circularization, previous studies demonstrated that back-splicing can be promoted by reverse complementary sequences (RCSs) residing in the introns flanking the circularized exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and affected by the competition of RCSs across flanking introns (RCS<sub>across</sub>) or within individual flanking introns (RCS<sub>within</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Genome-wide analyses of circRNA-flanking introns further revealed that the number of RCS<sub>across</sub> was generally larger than that of RCS<sub>within</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], suggesting the association between RCSs and circularization. It is helpful to examine the existence of RCSs for further investigation of circRNA formation.</p>
    <p id="Par17">While several circRNA databases or web-based tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] also provide predictions of circRNA-miRNA interactions, they are often hampered by one or more of the following limitations: (1) the provided circRNA-regulated axes are based on the circRNA candidates identified/collected by the known circRNA databases only; (2) the examined circRNAs focus on human or limited species; (3) the number of query circRNAs is limited; or (4) the corresponding circRNA-miRNA or miRNA-mRNA axes are derived from computational predictions only. To address all the above limitations, we present CircMiMi (<bold><underline>circ</underline></bold>RNA-<bold><underline>mi</underline></bold>RNA-<bold><underline>m</underline></bold>RNA <bold><underline>i</underline></bold>nteractions), a Python-based software, to identify circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions across 18 species (including 16 animals and 2 plants) according to user-provided coordinates of circRNA junctions. It is noteworthy that the CircMiMi-identified circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions are derived from circRNA-miRNA and miRNA-mRNA axes with the support of computational predictions and/or experimental data (e.g., CLIP or microarray data). The executable files for visualizing the constructed circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory axes are provided. CircMiMi also provides optional functions for examining alignment ambiguity of circRNAs and RCSs across/within flanking sequences of back-splice junctions (BSJs). We further utilize CircMiMi to construct circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions based on the circRNAs collected in NeuroCirc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], which deposits more than 26,000 circRNAs derived from human brain tissues or neuronal cells. According to differentially expressed circRNAs (DE-circRNAs), miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a rich set of ASD-associated circRNA-miRNA-mRNA axes is also provided. With the ability in identifying circRNA-miRNA-mRNA axes across species, CircMiMi also identifies mouse circRNA-miRNA-mRNA axes based on human-mouse orthologous circRNAs. Enrichment analysis further shows that the targets of the DE-circRNA-associated axes are enriched for ASD risk genes. CircMiMi is highly automated and modularized, which is convenient to be expanded to include new experimental data in the future.</p>

      <title>Alignment ambiguity and RCS checking</title>
      <p id="Par18">The workflow of CircMiMi is illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a. CircMiMi can automatically collect the newest version of annotation information, if users do not specify the version. By inputting the coordinates of the BSJs, CircMiMi can automatically determine donor and acceptor sites of the circRNA candidates according to the input coordinates and strands. Since previous studies suggested that BSJs required canonical splice signals and tended to be located at well-annotated exon boundaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], CircMiMi offers users an optional function for checking whether the input BSJs are located at well-annotated exon boundaries and whether both the donor and acceptor splice junctions of a circRNA event are located at the annotated boundaries from the same annotated co-linear transcripts. For accuracy, this optional module also checks if the input BSJs of circRNAs are potential false-positives derived from ambiguous alignments with an alternative co-linear explanation or multiple hits. The exonic circle sequences flanking the BSJs (100 bp upstream and downstream sequences of the junctions; see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b) are concatenated using bedtools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The concatenated sequences are then BLAT-aligned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] against the reference genome and well-annotated transcripts, with the default parameter set (-titleSize = 11 -stepSize = 11 -repMatch = 1024). A retained concatenated sequence should not map to an alternative co-linear matched sequence with &gt; 80% similarity with the concatenated sequence or multiple hits with BLAT-mapping scores &lt; 3 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Since different BLAT parameters may result in different alignment results, we realigned the concatenated sequences against the reference genome and well-annotated transcripts with a new BLAT-parameter set (-titleSize = 9 -stepSize = 9 -repMatch = 32,768) that is quite different from the default set. The alignment ambiguity checking is performed again. Only the concatenated sequences pass the alignment ambiguity checking based on both BLAT-parameter sets are retained. Such processes were demonstrated to effectively detect potentially false circRNA candidates from alignment ambiguity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This module further provides a function to examine RCSs across the flanking sequences (RCS<sub>across</sub>) or within individual flanking sequences (RCS<sub>within</sub>) of the BSJs (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). For examining RCS<sub>across</sub> of a circRNA, both flanking sequences (± N nucleotides of the back-splice site; N is a parameter representing the number of nucleotides) are aligned each other using BLAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] with parameters –task blastn –word_size 11 –strand minus. For examining RCS<sub>within</sub> of a circRNA, each individual flanking sequence is aligned itself using BLAST with the same parameters stated above. Of note, N is a user-defined parameter. The potential RCSs should be simultaneously satisfied the following rules: bitscore &gt; 100, alignment length &gt; 50 bp, and identity &gt; 80%. The BLAST-parameters are set according to a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Overview of CircMiMi. <bold>a</bold> Flowchart of the overall pipeline. <bold>b</bold> Schematic illustration of back-splicing events arising from ambiguous alignments with an alternative co-linear explanation (left) and multiple hits (right).

      <title>Identification of circRNA-miRNA interactions</title>
      <p id="Par19">CircMiMi first generates putative exonic circle sequence for each circRNA event based on user-specified species, gene annotations and versions (Ensembl, Ensembl Metazoa, Ensembl Plants, or GENCODE) (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). According to the mature miRNA sequences extracted from miRBase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], two procedures were utilized to identify miRNA binding sites in the predicted circle sequences of circRNAs and construct potential circRNA-miRNA interactions. The first procedure screens potential miRNA binding sites at circRNAs using miRanda 3.3a (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/miranda/README.html">https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/miranda/README.html</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Here we use a stringent parameter set with pairing score &gt; 155 and energy score &lt; − 20 recommended by a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. For each predicted miRNA, the number of predicted binding site and the highest miRanda score of these binding site(s) were showed. The binding sites spanning the BSJ were also considered and represented. For human and mouse, CircMiMi provides the second procedure, which screens the miRanda-predicted miRNA binding sites and represents the binding sites supported by at least one Argonaute (Ago) CLIP-seq experiments. The Ago CLIP-seq data were downloaded from ENCORI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://starbase.sysu.edu.cn/">http://starbase.sysu.edu.cn/</ext-link>. The liftOver tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] was employed to obtain the genomic coordinates of binding sites on the GRCh38 assembly.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table

The former collected miRNA-mRNA axes predicted by MirTarget (version 4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] across five species; and the latter collected experimentally-supported miRNA-mRNA axes across 23 species. Of note, for the miRTarBase-collected miRNA-mRNA axes, we only considered the axes from the 18 species with Ensembl-based annotations (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

The lists of genes encoding postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins and targets of FMR1, RBFOX1, and ELAVL1 were downloaded from Lee et al.’s study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. We assessed each ASD-relevant gene list for the targets of the axes using the similar steps stated in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. For example, regarding the analysis of PSD gene enrichment for the target genes of the axes, we created a two-way contingency table with rows containing numbers of PSD and non-PSD genes and columns containing numbers of target genes and non-target genes. Here we used 20,070 protein-coding genes as the background set. We evaluated the statistical significance and odds ratio using one-tailed Fisher’s exact test with the <italic>fisher.test</italic> R function. <italic>P</italic> values were then FDR adjusted using BH correction.

      <title>Implementation</title>
      <p id="Par25">The CircMiMi provides four main functions: (1) collecting all required resources; (2) checking BSJ, alignment ambiguity, and RCS; (3) identifying circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions; and (4) generating a Cytoscape-executable file (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). CircMiMi is implemented in Python 3 (tested with 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9) and tested on major Linux distributions. CircMiMi is straightforward to install via “pip install circmimi”. The bedtools, BLAT, BLAST, and miRanda packages can be installed via “conda install -c bioconda bedtools = 2.29.0 blat blast miranda”. For user convenience, we also provide a program to automatically collect all required resources (genomic sequences, Ensembl- or Gencode-based annotation/version, miRBase, ENCORI, miRTarBase, and miRDB) in a specified folder via the command line “circmimi_tools genref” (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). If users do not specify the genome/annotation versions, CircMiMi automatically accesses the newest versions from the corresponding web sites. Moreover, the users can upload users-defined miRNA sequences or miRNA-target binding information into the specified folder (i.e., refs/) to determine circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions. The CircMiMi command lines also include the miRanda parameters for further screening circRNA-miRNA axes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). The output tables include “summary_list” and “all_interactions”. The former sums up the results through the CircMiMi screening processes; and the latter represents all identified circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions.</p>

    <title>Result and discussion</title>
    <p id="Par26">We employed the circRNA candidates collected in NeuroCirc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] as an example for analyzing circRNA-mediated interactions based on CircMiMi. Of note, NeuroCirc encompassed 26,136 circRNA candidates, providing an integrative view of circRNA expression in human brain tissues. After alignment ambiguity checking, we found that 1531 out of the 26,136 (5.9%) circRNA candidates were likely to be derived from ambiguous alignments with an alternative co-linear explanation (480 events) or multiple hits (1051 events) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Ambiguous alignments may originate from repetitive sequences or paralogous genes, which often result in false positive circRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Compared with five other well-known circRNA databases including circRNAdb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], CircBase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], CIRCpedia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], CircFunBase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], and CircAtlas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], we can find that the percentages of circRNAs derived from alignment ambiguity remarkably decreased with increasing numbers of supporting circRNA databases, regardless of the types of alignment ambiguity (circRNA candidates with an alternative co-linear explanation or multiple hits; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). The percentage was significantly reduced from 65% (the circRNAs were detected in NeuroCirc only) to 0% (the circRNAs were detected in NeuroCirc and all the five databases examined) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a), supporting the association of circRNA reliability with alignment ambiguity. This result suggests that the circRNA candidates passing the alignment ambiguity checking may be relatively reliable for the further investigation.</p>
    <p id="Par27">Since back-splicing can be facilitated by RCSs residing in the sequences flanking circularized exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and affected by the competition of RCSs across flanking regions (RCS<sub>across</sub>) or within individual regions (RCS<sub>within</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], RCSs were often used to investigate circRNA formation (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]). We found that the majority (76%; 19,865 out of the 26,136 circRNAs) of the NeuroCirc-identified circRNAs were observed to have RCSs (RCS<sub>across</sub>) in the flanking sequences of their back-splice sites (± 10 k nucleotides of the back-splice site) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Furthermore, 3847 out of the 19,865 circRNAs exhibited (RCS<sub>across</sub> − RCS<sub>within</sub>) ≥ 1 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). The RCS information may provide a starting point for further analysis of circularization, although the existence of RCS is not the absolutely necessary factor for circRNA formation in non-mammalian species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] such as <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Both the checks of alignment ambiguity and RCS are optional in the CircMiMi pipeline (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d).</p>
    <p id="Par28">Regarding the 26,136 NeuroCirc circRNAs, we proceeded to construct potential circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). We first identified potential circRNA-miRNA axes using miRanda and experimental data (Ago CLIP-seq data from ENCORI), respectively. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, a total of 416,103 circRNA-miRNA axes were identified. According to the miRNAs of the 416,103 circRNA-miRNA axes, we extracted miRNA-mRNA interactions from one database (miRDB) that contained bioinformatically predicted miRNA-mRNA axes and two databases (miRTarBase and ENCORI) that contained experimentally-supported miRNA-mRNA axes. A total of 2,849,904 miRNA-mRNA interactions were extracted. After that, the 468,117,154 potential circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions were constructed according to the common target miRNAs of the circRNAs and mRNAs. In terms of the experimental evidence of circRNA-miRNA axes and miRNA-mRNA axes, the identified circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions can be classified into three categories as follows (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b).</p>
    <p id="Par29"><italic>Category 1</italic> 108,816,445 axes; both circRNA-miRNA axes and miRNA-mRNA axes were supported by experimental data.</p>
    <p id="Par30"><italic>Category 2</italic> 230,384,315 axes; either circRNA-miRNA axes or miRNA-mRNA axes was supported by experimental data.</p>

    <p id="Par32">Since the circRNA candidates in NeuroCirc were derived from human brain tissue samples from neuronal differentiation datasets or individuals with neurodevelopmental diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], it is of interest to investigate the circRNAs that were perturbed in neurodevelopmental diseases (e.g., Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia) and the corresponding circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions. In terms of ASD, our previously identified DE-circRNAs (60 circRNAs) in ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] were all included in NeuroCirc (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). On the basis of the 60 DE-circRNAs, CircMiMi identified 79,552 circRNA-miRNA-mRNA axes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). Of the 79,552 axes, we further extracted 1777 circRNA-miRNA-mRNA axes that involved DE-circRNAs and DE-miRNAs simultaneously (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). Of note, the extracted DE-miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] were derived from the same postmortem brain samples used for identification of the 60 DE-circRNAs. We then examined whether the target genes of the 1777 circRNA-miRNA-mRNA axes were implicated in ASD. We performed enrichment analyses (see <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>) for the gene sets previously implicated in ASD from SFARI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and other classes of ASD-relevant genes, including genes encoding postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] and genes whose transcripts were bound by the three RNA binding proteins: FMR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], RBFOX1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], and ELAVL1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Indeed, these target genes showed significant enrichment (all FDR &lt; 0.05 by one-sided Fisher’s exact test and empirical gene enrichment analysis) for each class of ASD-relevant genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). The 70 circRNA-miRNA-mRNA axes that simultaneously involved DE-circRNAs, DE-miRNAs, and SFARI genes were illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c (the detailed information of the identified interactions and ASD relevance were given in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). These data may provide a useful resource for further investigating regulatory mechanisms in ASD pathophysiology.</p>
    <p id="Par33">Moreover, considering the 5 DE-circRNAs examined above (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a), 3 were orthologous to mouse circRNAs according to the CircAtlas annotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. On the basis of the 3 mouse circRNAs, CircMiMi identified 20,613 circRNA-miRNA-mRNA axes, which were associated 62 miRNAs and 1741 target genes in mouse (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). Intriguingly, we found that these target genes were significantly enriched for the SFARI genes based on mouse models (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e). This implies that the mouse circRNA-miRNA-mRNA axes derived from DE-circRNAs in human ASD brains is helpful for further investigation of regulatory mechanisms underlying ASD.</p>

    <p id="Par34">In this work, we describe a well-tested stand-alone software called CircMiMi, which allows users to examine alignment ambiguity and RCSs of the input circRNA candidates, construct potential circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions, and visualize the identified circRNA-miRNA-mRNA axes. We utilized CircMiMi to identify circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions for all the circRNAs collected in NeuroCirc, a large-scale resource of circRNAs in the human brain. We further constructed circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions comprising DE-circRNAs and DE-miRNAs in human ASD and found that the targets of axes were enriched for ASD-relevant genes, providing important insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms in ASD etiology. Since CircMiMi can be applied to circRNA candidates derived from multiple species, we also constructed mouse circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions based on human-mouse orthologous circRNAs that were previously identified DE-circRNAs in human ASD brains. Our results revealed that the targets of such constructed axes were enriched for ASD risk genes based on mouse models. Taken together, this user-friendly tool may contribute to evaluation of circRNA reliability, investigation of circRNA formation, and cross-species functional analyses of circRNA-associated regulatory interactions, expanding our understanding of this important but understudied class of transcripts. CircMiMi will be continually updated as new experimental data of circRNA-miRNA and miRNA-mRNA interactions are available.</p>
