        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Because of their high abundance, easy accessibility in peripheral blood, and relative stability <italic toggle="yes">ex vivo</italic>, antibodies serve as excellent records of environmental exposures and immune responses. Phage Immuno-Precipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) is the most efficient technique available for assessing antibody binding to hundreds of thousands of peptides at a cohort scale. PhIP-Seq is a high-throughput approach for assessing antibody reactivity to hundreds of thousands of candidate epitopes. Accurate detection of weakly reactive peptides is particularly important for characterizing the development and decline of antibody responses. Here, we present BEER (Bayesian Enrichment Estimation in R), a software package specifically developed for the quantification of peptide reactivity from PhIP-Seq experiments. BEER implements a hierarchical model and produces posterior probabilities for peptide reactivity and a fold change estimate to quantify the magnitude. BEER also offers functionality to infer peptide reactivity based on the edgeR package, though the improvement in speed is offset by slightly lower sensitivity compared to the Bayesian approach, specifically for weakly reactive peptides.</p>

    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>Understanding interactions between the immune system and antigens is important to advance our understanding of the disease, disease progression and for the development of therapeutics. Phage-ImmunoPrecipitation sequencing (PhIP-Seq) is a high-throughput technique to characterize antibody responses to extensive antigen libraries (<xref rid="btac555-B4" ref-type="bibr">Larman <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Normalized sera are mixed with bacteriophages expressing the target peptides of interest, forming antibody–phage complexes (<xref rid="btac555-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, left). These complexes are precipitated with magnetic beads, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified and barcoded for multiplexing. The resulting product is sequenced and a matrix containing the number of sequencing reads with alignment to each peptide in the library for each sample is generated. Any alignment tool suitable for DNA or RNA short-read sequencing such as Bowtie (<xref rid="btac555-B3" ref-type="bibr">Langmead, 2010</xref>) or exact matching via grep can be used to align sequencing reads to the peptides in the library, and fastq files are then converted to read count matrices (for a detailed bioinformatics workflow including recommendations for demultiplexing and read alignment to the reference sequence database, see <xref rid="btac555-B5" ref-type="bibr">Mohan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). PhIP-Seq libraries include VirScan (<xref rid="btac555-B10" ref-type="bibr">Xu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), quantifying antibody binding to around 100 000 peptides spanning the genomes of more than 200 viruses that infect humans, among others. The primary objective is to identify antibody reactive peptides and to quantify the strength of antibody binding. PhIP-Seq experiments require the use of negative controls (so-called ‘beads-only’ or ‘mock immunoprecipitations’ lacking antibody input), which are included as 4–8 wells of a 96-well plate, and are compared to the read counts from each individual serum sample on the plate. We recently developed and implemented BEER, a Bayesian framework for identifying reactive peptides (<xref rid="btac555-B2" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>, preprint available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.19.476926v1" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.19.476926v1</ext-link>).</p>

    <title>2 Features</title>
    <p>PhIP-Seq experimental data are coordinated with sample and peptide metadata using the S4 class <monospace>PhIPData</monospace> (<xref rid="btac555-B1" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). <monospace>PhIPData</monospace> extends <monospace>SummarizedExperiment</monospace>, enabling users to conveniently subset the data while preserving metadata information (<xref rid="btac555-B6" ref-type="bibr">Morgan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). Peptide metadata can be added to a <monospace>PhIPData</monospace> object from a database of peptide libraries. Additionally, <monospace>PhIPData</monospace> supports peptide subsetting using user-defined aliases for viruses (<xref rid="btac555-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, center).</p>
    <sec>
      <title>2.1 Detecting reactive peptides</title>
      <p>In the Bayesian approach for detecting peptide reactivity, we model the observed read counts as a Binomial distribution, with a Binomial sample size equal to the total number of reads in the sample, and varying Binomial ‘success probabilities’ (i.e. the probability of pulling a read) for different samples and peptides. These probabilities depend on whether a sample is a serum sample or a beads-only (mock IP) control. We model the overall distributions for the peptides in a beads-only sample using Beta distributions with peptide-specific shape parameters, borrowing strength across peptides. The fold changes are modeled as shifted Gamma distributions for the enriched peptides, and the enrichment status is modeled as Bernoulli. Both the proportion of peptides expected to be enriched and the attenuation constant are modeled as Beta distributions (<xref rid="btac555-B2" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). The model was implemented using the Just Another Gibbs Sampler (JAGS) infrastructure and was executed in the statistical environment R using the interface implemented in the add-on package rjags (<xref rid="btac555-B8" ref-type="bibr">Plummer, 2019</xref>). The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers can conveniently be run in parallel, for example, for all peptides on the virus level.</p>
      <p>The core function of BEER is <monospace>brew</monospace> (<xref rid="btac555-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, right). Each sample is compared individually to all beads-only samples. <monospace>brew</monospace> first estimates the underlying distribution of reads pulled for beads-only samples (see Section 2.2). The remaining parameters describing the prior distributions can be specified in the <monospace>prior.params</monospace> argument in <monospace>brew</monospace> (defaults are offered). To improve scalability, clearly enriched peptides [based on maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs)] above some user-defined thresholds are excluded, and prior parameters are re-estimated from the beads-only samples for the remaining peptides. MLEs are also used to initialize the MCMC sampler in JAGS. Parameters to specify the MCMC sampling scheme (such as the total number of iterations, the thinning parameters, the number of burn-in iterations, the randomization seed, etc.) are defined by <monospace>jags.params</monospace> in <monospace>brew</monospace>. The MCMC chains are summarized as posterior means for the model parameters, the key parameter being the binary indicator denoting whether a peptide elicits an enriched antibody response in the serum sample (<xref rid="btac555-B2" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). In addition, estimated fold changes, the proportion of enriched peptides per sample, etc. can be added to the <monospace>PhIPData</monospace> object (<xref rid="btac555-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, right column). Helper functions such as <monospace>getBF</monospace>, which returns the estimated Bayes factors in a new <monospace>PhIPData</monospace> assay, can be used to visualize the results. The false-positive rate can be estimated using a beads-only round robin, comparing each beads-only sample to all other beads-only samples on the same plate by setting the argument <monospace>beadsRR</monospace> in <monospace>brew</monospace> to <monospace>TRUE</monospace>.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.2 Edger functionality</title>
      <p>Since the output from both PhIP-Seq and RNA-Seq experiments are read count matrices, existing software for normalization and analysis of RNA-Seq data such as edgeR (<xref rid="btac555-B9" ref-type="bibr">Robinson <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>) can also be applied to PhIP-Seq data. However, important differences in the data structures, experimental design and study objectives exist between the two approaches (<xref rid="btac555-B2" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). We do recommend using existing functionality in the edgeR package for PhIP-Seq data to estimate the shape parameters for the Beta prior distributions for the probabilities of peptides pulling reads. edgeR uses an empirical Bayes approach to approximate the larger than binomial variability observed in the read counts, which improves performance compared to other estimation methods such as methods of moments and maximum likelihood estimation that do not borrow strength across peptides (<xref rid="btac555-B2" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>).</p>
      <p>Since edgeR does not rely on MCMC procedures and thus generates inference faster than BEER, we further investigated the performance of edgeR analyzing PhIP-Seq data in a two-group comparison with the mock IP samples in one group and a single serum sample in the other group (assuming equality of group variances) and found that BEER and edgeR are equally effective in detecting moderately and strongly reactive peptides, but BEER is needed to detect weakly reactive peptides (<xref rid="btac555-B2" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). For user convenience, we included an edgeR-based pipeline for PhIP-Seq data in the BEER package. The method (classic likelihood ratio test or quasi-likelihood F-test) can be chosen using the <monospace>de.method</monospace> argument in the <monospace>runEdgeR</monospace> function. Two-sided edgeR <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values are converted into one-sided <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values (only enriched read counts indicate peptide reactivity) and are added with the estimated log fold changes to the <monospace>PhIPData</monospace> object via the function <monospace>runEdgeR</monospace>. Functionality also includes the round robin approach described above to assess the false-positive rate, which can be executed in <monospace>runEdgeR</monospace> with the argument <monospace>beadsRR</monospace>.</p>

    <title>3 Conclusion</title>
    <p>The Bioconductor package BEER provides two approaches for identifying reactive peptides from PhIP-Seq data, a Bayesian approach using an MCMC sampler, and an approach implemented in the RNA-Seq software package edgeR. The former is more sensitive detecting weakly reactive peptides, which may be particularly important when analyzing historic infections or the early stages of a developing antibody response. The implementations of the respective main functions <monospace>brew</monospace> and <monospace>runEdgeR</monospace> support parallelization for running multiple samples on one plate using the package BiocParallel in R (<xref rid="btac555-B7" ref-type="bibr">Morgan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). BEER returns posterior probabilities for read count enrichment but does not explicitly generate a list of reactive peptides. We recommend to use posterior probabilities larger than 50% to delineate reactive peptides (<xref rid="btac555-B2" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>).</p>
