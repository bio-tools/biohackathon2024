    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>In the post-genomic era, a key task is to systematically and comprehensively understand the relationships between bioentities in living cells [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The foundation for this mission is the rapid development of high-throughput technologies and the discovery of new transcripts or translations [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For example, the increasing evidence prove that the biomolecule networks such as protein-protein interaction network, ncRNA-disease association network, drug-target interaction network play important roles in protein synthesis [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], gene expression [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], RNA processing [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and developmental regulation [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Consequently, research into the relationships between bioentities will not only provide novel insights into life processes but also facilitate disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and drug development.</p>
    <p>Wet lab experiments to identify relationships between bioentities in large-scale datasets are labor-intensive and time-consuming and have limited real-world utility. Meanwhile, the extensive amount of accumulated experimental data causes information overload, which makes it prohibitively costly to acquire valuable knowledge. Hence, biological experiments can be effectively guided by data-based computer modeling methods to accelerate genomics and proteomics research progress [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
    <p>The computational biology community has developed many computational methods, such as matrix factorization [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], machine learning [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and network analysis [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] to detect previously unknown relationships between entities. Guo et al. proposed a computational model to predict potential associations between diseases and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) by integrating evidence of known associations with disease semantic similarity [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Wang et al. adopted the logistic model tree methodology to integrate information from multiple sources to discover unknown associations between diseases and microRNA (miRNA) [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Li et al. used the position-specific scoring matrix to represent proteins, and then put these into an ensemble classifier to predict self-interacting and non–self-interacting proteins [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Wang et al. used rotation forest to discover unknown drug–target interactions by drug structure and protein sequence [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
    <p>However, the incompleteness of the data constrains the credibility of predictions made by these methods, resulting in high false-positive and false-negative rates [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In recent years, the discovery of new types of bioentities and their relationships has provided novel insights to improve this situation to some extent. Additional bioentities may be considered as bridges to synergistically facilitate our knowledge of underlying biological principles and improve prediction. For example, Chen et al. were able to effectively improve the prediction of miRNA–disease associations by taking environmental factors into account [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Similarly, Cui et al. drew from gene expression data to make preliminary explorations into predicting drug–disease associations [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
    <p>In the past few years, much molecular data have accumulated, but computational methods have failed to make significant breakthroughs because few people regard cells as being complete units. In fact, cells comprise nodes (bioentities) and edges (relationships), much like a network (graph), to maintain normal life activities and physiological functions. The ability to establish connections between internal or external factors and gene expression would be helpful for understanding biological systems. Here, we constructed a molecular association network (MAN), based on various online databases, such as NONCODE [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and miRbase [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], to help systematically analyze the relationships between bioentities within human cells.</p>
    <p>Faced with such a large-scale network, the most critical challenge is how to quickly and effectively describe the nodes. In general, each bioentity can be defined by its own attributes and behaviors [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Attribute features can be represented by RNA sequences, drug chemical structures, etc. [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22–24</xref>]. The semantic description of drug or disease can also be considered as a kind of representation, which is widely used in relationship prediction tasks, such as drug reposition [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. On the other hand, network-based methods, especially the rapid development of graph-embedding (network representation) algorithms, has provided great hope for being able to clearly describe relationships between nodes [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25–32</xref>].</p>
    <p>Graph embedding, in which nodes are represented in a network as dense vector forms, is chosen to respond to this situation [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Although some existing bioinformatics models contain the idea of graph embedding, many still focus on traditional techniques, including principal component analysis [<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], multidimensional scaling [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], Isomap [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and local linear embeddings [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In general, these methods offer satisfactory performance for small networks. However, at least quadratic time complexity restricts the application of these methods to large-scale data. Recently, deep learning has attracted research attention. Here, the representation method DeepWalk is applied.</p>
    <p>We constructed a MAN and propose a graph-embedding algorithm to represent each node as a vector (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>). Specifically, 18 kinds of associations or interactions between 8 kinds of biomolecules were collected from various databases to construct the network. The lower triangular part of the adjacency matrix, <italic>A</italic>, simplifies calculation and storage. Each bioentity can be represented as a vector by combining attribute and behavior features (see flow chart in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). We used random forest to predict multi-type relationships across an entire network, obtaining an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.9608, and an area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) of 0.9572, using 5-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, we implemented 3 experiments to compare feature importance, embedding strategy, and proportions of training sets. Our results suggest the potential utility of MAN for revealing previously uncovered relationships. We hope that this work can provide assistance and guidance for wet experiments and be useful for researchers seeking to understand gene regulation and disease mechanisms and to discover new drugs at the molecular level.</p>

      <title>Node attribute representation: <italic>k</italic>-mer, semantics, and fingerprint</title>
      <p>Protein and RNA sequences, disease and microbe semantics, and drug chemical structure are all essential features. We represented these as vectors using the following methods.</p>
      <p>For protein, mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA, and circular RNA (circRNA), sequences were collected from STRING (STRING, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:SCR_005223">RRID:SCR_005223</ext-link>) [<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], NCBI (NCBI, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:SCR_006472">RRID:SCR_006472</ext-link>) [<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], miRBase (miRbase, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:SCR_003152">RRID:SCR_003152</ext-link>) [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], NONCODE (NONCODE, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:SCR_007822">RRID:SCR_007822</ext-link>) [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and circBase [<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], respectively. Proteins are composed of 20 different amino acids; using the method described by Shen et al. [<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], we first classified these into 4 categories based on amino acid side chain polarity: (i) alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and proline; (ii) glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, asparagine, glycine, and tyrosine; (iii) arginine, lysine, histidine; and (iv) aspartate and glutamic acid. RNA, including mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA, and circRNA, is composed of 4 nucleotides: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and uracil (U), with the same sequence composition, so we directly encode their original sequences without pre-treatment. Each RNA molecule or protein can be represented as a vector by <italic>k</italic>-mer, in which all dimensions represent the full permutation of <italic>k</italic> nucleotide (or amino acid) combinations, and the value of each dimension is the normalized frequency of the corresponding <italic>k</italic>-mer appearing in the sequence. In this article, <italic>k</italic> = 3, and each protein or RNA can be represented as a 64-dimension (4<sup>3</sup> = 4 × 4 × 4) vector.</p>
      <p>Diseases and microbes were characterized using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) descriptors. Top-level categories in the MeSH tree structure are anatomy [A], organisms [B], diseases [C], and so on. The categories corresponding to microbes and diseases are B and C, respectively. As done by Wang et al. [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], we construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of diseases and microbes (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) to represent them through their semantics. For example, a microbe <italic>M</italic> can be represented as a graph DAG<italic>(M)</italic>= (<italic>M, N</italic>(<italic>M</italic>)<italic>, E</italic>(<italic>M</italic>)), where <italic>N</italic>(<italic>M</italic>) is the set of all nodes in <italic>M</italic>’s DAG and <italic>E</italic>(<italic>M</italic>) is the set of all edges in <italic>M</italic>’s DAG. The semantic contribution of microbe <italic>m</italic>, which is in the node set <italic>N</italic>(<italic>M</italic>) to <italic>M</italic>, can be defined as:

      <title>Node behavior representation: DeepWalk</title>
      <p>Using “guilt-by-association” assumptions, we use a more general behavioral feature in complex networks. Generally speaking, this involves embedding representations of known edges between nodes in a network. Despite this, a row or column of the adjacency matrix can directly be used as a representation vector for node behavior in a one-hot encoding method. However, there is no concept of similarity between each dimension of such high-dimensional, sparse vectors because it is represented as indices in a relationship. Meanwhile, the one-hot encoding method takes up a lot of storage space and is not conducive to the input of downstream tasks. Hence, how to extract information about behavior from nodes in complex networks such as a MAN is challenging.</p>
      <p>Here, we use a network embedding method called DeepWalk [<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The main idea is to obtain a certain length of the walk sequence through random walk, an ideal mathematical state of Brownian motion that can repeatedly access the visited nodes. After obtaining enough sequences, the vectors of the nodes can be learned by the SkipGram model. The direct analog is to estimate the likelihood of observing vertex <inline-formula><tex-math id="M4">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <p>The effects of parameters <italic>w</italic> and <italic>t</italic> on the results were not obvious. At the same time, smaller values can significantly reduce the experimental running time. Larger values of <italic>w</italic> and <italic>t</italic> may introduce additional noise and increase calculation burden. In fact, the structure of the MAN is totally different from those of previous benchmark datasets such as Facebook and Twitter. For traditional social networks, vertices with the same label are closely related. In the network of the present article, there are generally no edges between vertices of the same label, except in a protein–protein interaction network. The representation of vertices is mainly through the description of relationship with other types of vertices. To ensure as much experimental reproducibility as possible, we set the parameters <italic>w</italic> and <italic>t</italic> to the commonly used values 10 and 80. After generating the sequence of vertices, a Python package called gensim was applied to generate word-embedding representation.</p>

      <p>Random forest is a classifier containing multiple decision trees whose output is determined by the mode of the output of each decision tree. It can efficiently process high-dimensional features, even in large data volumes. In addition, its high adaptability makes it possible to accept both discrete and continuous data. Here, we used the Python package sklearn to perform the random forest classifier, with default values.</p>

      <title>Relationship prediction based on the whole dataset under 5-fold cross-validation</title>
      <p>Relationship prediction is common in both academia and industry. Here, some edges in the original graph are hidden as test sets and we construct the model based on the residual network. We evaluate the proposed method through 5-fold cross-validation. Under this strategy, the whole dataset is divided into 5 mutually exclusive subsets of roughly equal size. Each subset is used as the test set in turn to assess the effect of the classifier, and the remaining 4 subsets are used as a training set to construct the model. In each fold, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) and precision-recall curves (PR) are drawn to visualize the results, respectively. There are 114,150 valid experimental relationships in the whole network. In each fold cross-validation, 80% of the edges of the entire network are processed by Bioentity2vec and are treated as training samples; 20% of edges are considered test samples.</p>
      <p>Various evaluation criteria, including accuracy (Acc.), sensitivity (Sen.), specificity (Spec.), precision (Prec.), and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) are adopted to measure experimental results. Results are presented in Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and show that our method can help to make stable and robust decisions and accurately discover potential associations.</p>

      <p>Considering the “new sample” (cold start) problem in practical biological experiments, we do not guarantee that the degree of each node is &gt;0.

      <title>Comparison based on varying proportions of training sets</title>
      <p>Data integrity is a top priority in achieving global relationship prediction. To explore the effects of missing data on the results, we separately learned the representation vectors of each node in the whole graph. We built models using varying proportions of edges and evaluated their performance.</p>
      <p>Specifically, the dataset was divided into 4 parts: 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% of the edges of the full graph as training samples. Correspondingly, the remaining edges of the graph, 80%, 60%, 40%, and 20%, were used as test samples. Here, each node is characterized only by its behavioral feature.</p>
      <p>It can be seen from Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> that, when only 20% of the edges of the entire network are used to generate node features and model construction, our method still achieves an AUC of 0.8710 and an AUPR of 0.8747. This demonstrates the excellent data-mining ability of this method.</p>

In total, 17,414 experimentally verified drug–disease associations were collected from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) [<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].

      <p>For Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9b</xref>, node behaviors are represented based on only drug–disease associations. Taking the idea of “guilt-by-association,” each node is abstracted into a 128-dimension vector by combining attributes and single-type associations. Compared to Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">a</xref> slightly elevated AUC confirms the results of our feature importance comparison experiment and shows that measuring the local function of biomolecules improves prediction performance to some extent.</p>

In each cross-validation, Bioentity2vec handles 80% drug–disease pairs with 17 kinds of relationships. Taking the 128-dimension vectors that integrate attributes and behaviors as inputs, the random forest classifier is chosen for training and testing. Compared with previous methods, the results that we obtained indicate that the extra edges serve as an intermediary to facilitate the prediction of associations when faced with specific problems.</p>
      <p>For Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9d</xref>, we carried out a special embedding strategy based on that described by Chen [<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The remaining 17 types of relationship without drug–disease association pairs were learned by DeepWalk to obtain behavior representation vectors. This process does not depend on direct drug–disease associations. To eliminate the influence of the attribute feature on prediction performance, each node representation vector was constructed only by using behavior features under this special strategy. Nevertheless, the model still achieved a mean AUC of 0.7562 under 5-fold cross-validation, which implies that our MAN contains a wealth of biological information.</p>
      <p>Note: to ensure the fairness of the experiment, negative samples of 4 experiments and each subset under 5-fold cross-validation were all consistent.</p>

      <title>A case study based on drug–disease association</title>
      <p>A case study of ataxia was implemented to assess the performance of the proposed method in a real-world environment. As mentioned, we collected 17,414 drug–disease associations from CTD [<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and processed these as described by Zhang et al. [<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. To verify the prediction ability of the proposed model for new disease, we removed 61 association pairs related to ataxia. The remaining 17,353 drug–disease associations were used as a training set to generate features and construct the model. Ataxia is paired with each drug to form the test set. The top 10 results can be seen in Table <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. All association pairs were verified by CTD. Inference score and references were provided by CTD. The term “unconfirmed” refers to an association pair that we were not able to find in the CTD. We sorted all drugs by Direct Evidence Rank, and the top 10 results are presented in Table <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">4</xref>.</p>

      <p>Such prediction results can be attributed to the following 2 points: (i) in an open environment, there are many problems associated with new samples (cold start). These samples can only be represented by attributes because there are not enough known relationships. (ii) CTD and DrugBank are 2 different databases, and their differences lead to insufficient relationships to generate expressive behavior representations of abiotic entities.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>Current biological entity relationship calculation methods only focus on a single type of relationship and cannot simultaneously detect complex multi-type relationships between bioentities. The model proposed here may solve this issue. Specifically, in developing a comprehensive molecular association network, we propose the use of Bioentity2vec to generate representation vectors for different bioentities. Combined with the random forest classifier, promising results have been demonstrated in single- and multi-type relationship prediction. Our research represents a preliminary exploration from isolated molecules to complex molecular association networks. The concepts expressed in our research may yield novel ideas for the development of new theoretical systems, expand research objects, and accelerate the integration of proteomics and genomics.</p>
