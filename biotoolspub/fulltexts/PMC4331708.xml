        <title>Background</title>
        <p>microRNAs (miRNAs) play a vital role in development, oncogenesis, and apoptosis by binding to mRNAs to regulate the posttranscriptional level of coding genes in mammals, plants, and insects. Recent studies have demonstrated that the expression of viral miRNAs is associated with the ability of the virus to infect a host. Identifying potential viral miRNAs from experimental sequence data is valuable for deciphering virus-host interactions. Thus far, a specific predictive model for viral miRNA identification has yet to be developed.</p>

        <title>Methods and results</title>
        <p>Here, we present ViralmiR for identifying viral miRNA precursors on the basis of sequencing and structural information. We collected 263 experimentally validated miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) from 26 virus species and generated sequencing fragments from virus and human genomes as the negative dataset. Support vector machine and random forest models were established using 54 features from RNA sequences and secondary structural information. The results show that ViralmiR achieved a balanced accuracy higher than 83%, which is superior to that of previously developed tools for identifying pre-miRNAs.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>microRNAs (miRNAs) are non-protein-coding RNAs that is approximately 22 nucleotides long, which results in the degradation of mRNAs by complementarily binding to the 3' untranslated regions of target genes. Recent studies have demonstrated that miRNAs play a vital role in development, oncogenesis, and apoptosis by binding to mRNAs to regulate the posttranscriptional level of coding genes in mammals, plants, and insects. In addition, miRNAs modulate viral existence in plants and animals by targeting viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Conversely, miRNAs are produced by viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Recent studies have demonstrated that the expression of viral miRNAs is associated with the ability of the virus to infect a host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Additionally, studies have reported that viral miRNAs are associated with human diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. For example, the Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis B and C viruses, and human papillomavirus are highly associated with gastric and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, liver cancer, and cervical cancer, respectively.</p>
    <p>Recently, several approaches have been developed for computationally identifying miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Various classifiers, such as the support vector machine (SVM), random forest, relaxed variable kernel density estimator (RVKDE), and bootstrap aggregating, were applied while different features generated from sequences and secondary structural information were employed. The characteristics of the approaches are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.</p>

    <p>Triplet-SVM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] involves applying an SVM to human data by using features from local, contiguous structure-sequence information for distinguishing the hairpins of real pre-miRNAs from pseudo pre-miRNAs. Each hairpin is encoded as a set of 32 triplet elements. MiPred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] involves applying a random forest machine learning algorithm to human data by using a hybrid feature, which consists of the 32 features used in Triplet-SVM and the minimum of free energy (MFE) of the secondary structure, and using a <italic>P</italic>-value randomization test to distinguish the real pre-miRNAs from other hairpin sequences with similar stem-loops (pseudo pre-miRNAs). The de novo SVM classifier miPred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] identifies pre-miRNAs without relying on phylogenetic conservation; 17 primary sequence features, 5 secondary structural features, and 7 normalized features are used in the model. The miR-KDE tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] was developed using the novel RVKDE classifier, which exploits local information, and is particularly suitable for predicting species-specific pre-miRNAs. Each hairpin-like sequence is summarized as a 33-dimentional feature vector, including the 29 features used in miPred and 4 stem-loop features. The microPred tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] uses effective machine learning methods for classifying human pre-miRNA hairpins from both pseudohairpins and other ncRNAs. Each hairpin is encoded using the 29 features from miPred, 6 RNAfold-related features, 4 Mfold-related features, 7 base-pair features, and 2 MFE-related features. The classification results showed reliability in both sensitivity (<italic>SN</italic>) and specificity (<italic>SP</italic>). The MiRenSVM tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] is an ensemble-SVM classification system for detecting miRNA genes, especially those with multiloop secondary structures; 8 triplet structural features, 8 base-pair group features, and 16 thermodynamic group features are considered in feature extractions of hairpin-like sequences. The miR-BAG tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] uses a bootstrap-aggregation-based machine learning approach to identify miRNA candidate regions in genomes by using scanning sequences. Comparative analysis results showed that miR-BAG performed more favorable than the previous six tools did. A next-generation sequencing module was combined with miR-BAG to provide high-throughput data analysis. Vir-Mir db [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] is a database for collecting predictive viral miRNA candidate hairpins into a virus genome by using the prediction filters of Srnaloop, sequences and structures, and open reading frames.</p>
    <p>Most of the previously developed approaches mainly emphasized identifying pre-miRNAs in human, plants, and other animals. Thus far, a method designed specifically for identifying viral pre-miRNAs has not been developed. Therefore, we collected experimentally validated viral pre-miRNA data and constructed a predictive model by using several sequencing and structural features. This model can assist biological researchers who study virus-host interactions in identifying potential viral miRNAs in experimental sequencing data.</p>

      <title>Datasets</title>
      <p>The positive dataset was collected from miRBase (Version 19). Two hundred sixty-three pre-miRNAs, including 437 mature miRNAs, from 26 virus species were collected as the positive dataset. The negative dataset consisted of three types of sequences, namely the virus genome, human pre-miRNAs, and Pseudo-8494. The virus genome dataset was composed of 789 randomly selected fragments with lengths of 120 bps in the virus genome, and the fragments containing positive data were removed. The human pre-miRNA dataset contained 1600 human pre-miRNAs collected from miRBase. Redundant or highly similar sequences had been removed from the dataset. The negative dataset was obtained from Xue et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and was used in miPred, miR-KDE, and other tools. We named this benchmark negative dataset "Pseudo-8494" because it was composed of 8494 fragments from the coding regions of human chromosome 19.</p>

      <title>Feature extraction and selection</title>
      <p>The SVM and random forest classification methods were applied to develop predictive models for viral-pre-RNA identification. The minimal free-energy and base-pair-related information were obtained using the RNAfold of the Vienna RNA package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Fifty-four features were selected from previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and the feature score (<italic>F-score</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] was used to evaluate the discriminative power of each feature. The features used in our model are described in the following paragraphs.</p>

        <title>32 triplet elements</title>
        <p>The local contiguous triplet-structure composition was defined as Triplet-SVM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. For the predicted secondary structure, an opening parenthesis "(" or a closing parenthesis ")" and a dot "." were used to denote paired and unpaired nucleotides. Generally, the opening parenthesis "("represents a paired nucleotide located near the 5′-end that can be paired with another nucleotide at the 3′-end, which is denoted by the closing parenthesis ")". This study used "(" for both situations. For any three adjacent nucleotides, there are eight (2<sup>3</sup>) possible triple-structure compositions: "(((", "((.", "(.(", ".((", "(..", ".(.", "..(", and "...". Considering the middle nucleotide, there are 32 (4 × 8) possible structure-sequence combinations, which are denoted as "C(((", "A.((", etc.</p>

      <title>Classification and performance evaluation</title>
      <p>SVM is a machine learning approach for solving classification and regression problems. It constructs a set of hyperplanes in a high- or infinite-dimensional space and has been widely applied to biological sequence classification. Random forest is a nonparametric tree-based ensemble method that is broadly applied in machine learning and can account for interactions and correlations among features. It constructs multiple decision trees during training time and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes output by individual trees. Here, LIBSVM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and random forest approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] were adopted to develop the predictive models for viral pre-miRNA identification.</p>
      <p>Fivefold cross validation was applied in a performance evaluation of the predictive models. The <italic>SN</italic>, <italic>SP</italic>, precision (<italic>PRE</italic>), accuracy (<italic>ACC</italic>), balanced ACC, and Matthew's correlation coefficient (<italic>MCC</italic>) were used to measure the classification performance and were defined as follows: <italic>SN = TP/(TP + FN)</italic>; <italic>SP = TN/(TN + FP)</italic>; <italic>PRE = TP/(TP + FP)</italic>; balanced ACC = (<italic>SN </italic>+ <italic>SP</italic>)/2; <italic>ACC = (TP + TN)/(TP + FP + TN + FN)</italic>; and <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1" name="1471-2105-16-S1-S9-i1" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle class="text"><mml:mtext class="textsf" mathvariant="sans-serif">MCC</mml:mtext></mml:mstyle><mml:mo class="MathClass-rel">=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle class="text"><mml:mtext class="textsf" mathvariant="sans-serif">TP</mml:mtext></mml:mstyle><mml:mo class="MathClass-bin"> × </mml:mo><mml:mstyle class="text"><mml:mtext class="textsf" mathvariant="sans-serif">TN</mml:mtext></mml:mstyle><mml:mo class="MathClass-bin">-</mml:mo><mml:mstyle class="text"><mml:mtext class="textsf" mathvariant="sans-serif">FP</mml:mtext></mml:mstyle><mml:mo class="MathClass-bin"> × </mml:mo><mml:mstyle class="text"><mml:mtext class="textsf" mathvariant="sans-serif">FN</mml:mtext></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle class="text"><mml:mtext class="textsf" mathvariant="sans-serif">(TP</mml:mtext></mml:mstyle><mml:mo class="MathClass-bin">+</mml:mo><mml:mstyle class="text"><mml:mtext class="textsf" mathvariant="sans-serif">FN)</mml:mtext></mml:mstyle><mml:mo class="MathClass-bin"> × </mml:mo><mml:mstyle class="text"><mml:mtext class="textsf" mathvariant="sans-serif">(TP</mml:mtext></mml:mstyle><mml:mo class="MathClass-bin">+</mml:mo><mml:mstyle class="text"><mml:mtext class="textsf" mathvariant="sans-serif">FP)</mml:mtext></mml:mstyle><mml:mo class="MathClass-bin"> × </mml:mo><mml:mstyle class="text"><mml:mtext class="textsf" mathvariant="sans-serif">(TN</mml:mtext></mml:mstyle><mml:mo class="MathClass-bin">+</mml:mo><mml:mstyle class="text"><mml:mtext class="textsf" mathvariant="sans-serif">FP)</mml:mtext></mml:mstyle><mml:mo class="MathClass-bin"> × </mml:mo><mml:mstyle class="text"><mml:mtext class="textsf" mathvariant="sans-serif">(TN</mml:mtext></mml:mstyle><mml:mo class="MathClass-bin">+</mml:mo><mml:mstyle class="text"><mml:mtext class="textsf" mathvariant="sans-serif">FN)</mml:mtext></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <italic>TP</italic>, <italic>FP</italic>, <italic>TN</italic>, and <italic>FN </italic>are the numbers of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], respectively.

The classification results for the SVM and random forest models are shown in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>. The results showed that the performance of both models increased after feature selection. The performance of the SVM model was superior to that of the random forest model for all datasets, achieving ACC values of 86.02%, 97.85%, and 90.23% when applied to the negative virus genome, Pseudo-8494, and human pre-miRNA datasets, respectively. Therefore, the SVM model was chosen as our final predictor for viral pre-miRNA identification.</p>

      <title>Comparison with previous studies using an independent dataset</title>
      <p>For a comparison of our approach with previously proposed approaches, 63 viral pre-miRNAs from a positive dataset and 189 sequences from a virus genome dataset were collected as an independent testing dataset, and our model for the comparison was constructed using the remaining data. Seven tools, namely Triplet-SVM, MiPred, miPred, miR-KDE, microPred, MiRenSVM, and miR-BAG, were used for the comparison. The classification results are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">7</xref>. The results showed that miPred had the highest <italic>SP </italic>(93.65%), <italic>ACC </italic>(86.9%), and <italic>MCC </italic>(0.63). Our approach had the highest <italic>SN </italic>(79.36%) as well as the highest balanced ACC (83.06%), which is calculated by considering the inflation of performance estimates caused by the use of an imbalanced dataset. Some testing data could be used from previous approaches when constructing the model, potentially resulting in an increase of the prediction performance.</p>

      <p>In addition to the use of the partial dataset for independent testing, 32 newly released virus pre-miRNAs from miRBase (Version 20) were collected as the positive data, and 96 randomly selected fragments from the virus genome were generated as the negative dataset. The classification results are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T8">8</xref>. The results showed that Triplet-SVM had the highest specificity (91.67%) and <italic>ACC </italic>(85.94%). Our model, ViralmiR, had the highest sensitivity (78.13%), <italic>ACC </italic>(85.94%), balanced ACC (83.33%), and <italic>MCC </italic>(0.64). The results showed that ViralmiR exhibited favorable performance in viral pre-miRNA identification and was superior to related predictors.</p>

      <p>A ViralmiR web interface was developed for identifying viral pre-miRNAs in RNA sequences. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, the ViralmiR web page provides a user-friendly interface and information related to predictive results. Users of the website can submit a sequence in the FASTA format to identify potential viral pre-miRNA. The positive dataset and three negative datasets used in this study are also provided on the website. The web server is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/viralmir/">http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/viralmir/</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
    <p>As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> the features with high <italic>F-scores </italic>are related to triplet elements, with "G(((" and "C(((" being the features having the highest <italic>F-scores</italic>. Other base-pair- and thermodynamic-related features, such as <italic>ConsecBP</italic>, <italic>dP</italic>, and <italic>%(G-C)/stems</italic>, also had high <italic>F-score </italic>values. The results showed that the G-C base-pair-related features play vital roles in viral pre-miRNA identification. In our analysis pipeline, the secondary structure for sequences was derived using RNAfold. However, in many instances, the structure predicted using the MFE may not resemble the real structure, and, thus, the predicted structure of the viral pre-miRNAs could not be formed as a hairpin-like shape, affecting the performance of the predictive models. An examination of our positive dataset showed that only 219 of the 263 viral pre-miRNAs could be formed into hairpin-like shapes by using the MFE. The other pre-miRNAs were formed in other shapes. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T9">9</xref> shows the number of hairpin-like and non-hairpin-like shapes in true-positive and false-negative predictions. The results show that most sequences (more than 93%) of true positive prediction were formed in hairpin-like shapes and most sequences (more than 77%) of false negative prediction were not formed in hairpin-like shapes in SVM model. e similar situations present in random forest model, showing that the prediction performance is highly associated with structural prediction. Therefore, further analysis of various folding parameters and window sizes is warranted to facilitate obtaining a more suitable parameter combination for predicting the secondary structure of viral pre-miRNAs.</p>

    <p>A tool for predicting viral pre-miRNAs in sequences can benefit biomedical researchers who study interactions between viral miRNAs and host genes. In this study, we present a virus-specific pre-miRNA prediction model, ViralmiR, based on sequence and RNA secondary-structure information. ViralmiR achieved a balanced ACC higher than 83%, which is superior to that of previously developed predictors. The easy-to-use ViralmiR web interface has been provided as a helpful resource for researchers to use in analyzing and deciphering virus-host interactions.</p>
