      <p>For the edge computing network, whether the end-to-end delay satisfies the delay constraint of the task is critical, especially for delay-sensitive tasks. Virtual machine (VM) migration improves the robustness of the network, whereas it also causes service downtime and increases the end-to-end delay. To study the influence of failure, migration, and recovery of VMs, we define three states for the VMs in an edge server and build a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). Then, we develop a matrix-geometric method and a first passage time method to obtain the VMs timely reliability (VTR) and the end-to-end timely reliability (ETR). The numerical results are verified by simulation based on OMNeT++. Results show that VTR is a monotonic function of the migration rate and the number of VMs. However, in some cases, the increase in task VMs (TVMs) may conversely decrease VTR, since more TVMs also brings about more failures in a given time. Moreover, we find that there is a trade-off between TVMs and backup VMs (BVMs) when the total number of VMs is limited. Our findings may shed light on understanding the impact of VM migration on end-to-end delay and designing a more reliable edge computing network for delay-sensitive applications.</p>

    <title>1. Introduction</title>
    <p>With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), delay-sensitive computing tasks are increasing in cloud computing networks. Because of the long distance between the user equipment and the cloud, dealing with the IoT data in the cloud will cause unacceptable latency, especially for stream or real-time IoT data. To satisfy the strict delay requirements of such IoT services, edge computing emerged. Edge computing provides computing and storage resources at the edge of the network, so that latency-sensitive data and private data can be handled nearby the users, such as applications, e.g., driverless cars, real-time traffic management, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and healthcare IoT [<xref rid="B1-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Regardless of the application scenario, the success of the task relies on the powerful and reliable processing capability of edge computing servers, especially for latency-sensitive applications.</p>
    <p>To achieve scalability and robustness, computing and storage resources in cloud servers or edge servers are usually managed by virtualization technology [<xref rid="B3-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Computing tasks are performed by independent virtual machines (VMs). Owing to virtualization technology, the network can facilitate load balancing and maintain servers without terminating the task by live migration of VM [<xref rid="B7-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. More importantly, if a VM crashes or is about to crash, the memory image of this VM can be migrated to an idle one and restart the processing, improving fault tolerance of the system. According to [<xref rid="B9-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], many software failures are transient, which means the system can reboot to repair the problem. If the VM failure is transient, the failed VM can reboot to recover in a short time after the migration. The processing capability of the system is thus recovered. However, as for latency-sensitive tasks, the virtualized management also creates new reliability challenges, which are the failure of VM reducing the processing capability and the migration of VM causing the service downtime [<xref rid="B12-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
    <p>Although researchers are trying to design migration mechanisms to shorten the total migration time and downtime, the downtime caused by VM migration still cannot be ignored, especially for service under strict Service Level Agreements (SLAs) [<xref rid="B12-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B14-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As a result, the influence of failure and migration of VM on the satisfying of transmission time requirements needs to be studied, since it is critical for system reliability evaluation, optimizing of resources allocating, and designing of resource management policy. For example, to avoid the server crash, the computing server will not usually assign all the VMs to provide service, but keep a part of VMs idle as backups. When the total number of VMs is limited, more task VMs do not always reduce the delay, since this also brings about more failures in a given time and reduces the backup VMs. Designers of the network and service providers are curious about how to make a trade-off between the task computing resource and idle resource to achieve the highest reliability of the computing network.</p>
    <p>The ability of an edge computing network to transmit and process data within the given time can be measured by timely reliability [<xref rid="B15-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. To analyze whether the VMs in the edge server and the whole network satisfy the time requirements of a task, we define the VM timely reliability (VTR) and the end-to-end timely reliability (ETR), respectively, and propose analysis methods. The end-to-end delay in the computer network consists of four types of delay [<xref rid="B19-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], that is, processing delay, transmission delay, propagation delay, and queueing delay. Since queueing delay is the main random variable of the four components of end-to-end delay [<xref rid="B18-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], we only consider processing delay and queueing delay of the edge server in this paper. From the perspective of edge computing, an edge server can be treated as a multi-server queue with unreliable servers, where the VMs are servers and the tasks are customers. At the same time, to protect the data, the recovery of VMs will not start until the memory image and state have been migrated. To measure the timely reliability of edge computing more precisely, we need to build a queueing model considering failure, migration, and reboot of VM. Present mathematical models [<xref rid="B20-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] cannot take the migration of VM into account and neglect the migration downtime. Therefore, to analyze the edge computing system considering migration and recovery of VM, the essential migration-related states of VM need to be defined in a new evaluation model. From the perspective of the network, the end-to-end delay of an edge computing network is determined by the joint distribution of the successive delays of a packet traversing multiple nodes [<xref rid="B28-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The main difficulty of networked queueing model analysis is the characterization of the departure process of an upstream queueing node, which is the arrival process of the next queueing node when all intermediate nodes are pure relays [<xref rid="B28-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
    <p>In this paper, to measure the timely reliability of edge computing more precisely, we define three VM states (available, failed-unmigrated, and failed-migrated) and build a multi-server queueing model considering failure, migration, and recovery of VM for edge computing server. The considered failures of VM are all transient and can be recovered by rebooting. The proposed queueing model is analyzed by a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) with three types of transfer relations solved by a matrix-geometric approach. The probability density function (PDF) of the sojourn time at an edge computing server is calculated based on the first passage time method. Then, we build a serial queueing model for the edge computing network base on Burke’s theorem, considering edge service and cloud service, respectively. Thereupon, the end-to-end delay and end-to-end timely reliability are obtained. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of VM migration on VTR, the analyzed factors including failure rate, migration rate, reboot rate, and resource allocation. Our results are verified by simulations based on OMNet++.</p>
    <p>The main contributions of this paper include: (1) We build a multi-server queueing model that firstly takes account of failure, migration, and recovery of VMs. The present works merely analyze the situation where VMs run perfectly [<xref rid="B24-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B29-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. (2) A partitioned CTMC method is proposed to analyze three-dimension CTMC and obtain the VM timely reliability. (3) An analysis method based on Burke’s theorem is proposed to obtain the PDF of the end-to-end delay, which is indispensable for the evaluation of end-to-end timely reliability. Present works either obtain average metrics only, such as mean queue length and mean wait time [<xref rid="B24-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B29-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B31-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], or obtain the end-to-end timely reliability by simulations [<xref rid="B18-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B32-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. (4) We investigate the impact of VM migration and assigning of task VMs and backup VMs on the VTR, which can be a guidance for the designing of a more reliable edge computing network for delay-sensitive applications.</p>

      <title>2.1. Network Delay Analysis</title>
      <p>As mentioned before, the end-to-end delay in the computer network consists of processing delay, transmission delay, propagation delay, and queueing delay [<xref rid="B19-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We investigate the literature of the network delay analysis, especially on the queueing delay, and provide a comparative table mainly focusing on the analysis method as below. The main models and methods are described in the table. In <xref rid="sensors-21-00093-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, “Fixed queues” means that the structure of the queue models of a task is fixed. For example, in [<xref rid="B24-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], the queue model is a serial queue consists of the queue of edge computing, the queue of cloud gateway, and the queue of cloud computing; “Stochastic queues” means that the structure of the queue models is not fixed, but determined by some specific mechanisms with probabilities. For example, in [<xref rid="B33-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], tasks might be processed at the IoT layer, fog layer, or cloud layer with different probabilities; “Homogeneous servers” means that the queue servers in the model are all homogeneous, i.e., each server has the same service rate [<xref rid="B34-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; “Heterogeneous servers” means that the queue servers in the model are heterogeneous [<xref rid="B29-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>

      <title>2.2. VMs Timely Reliability Analysis</title>
      <p>In the delay analysis of a single node, the main delays include processing delay and queueing delay. Queueing theory is widely used to analyze node delay. Usually, the processes in the computing server are modeled with multiple servers, including homogeneous servers [<xref rid="B24-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and heterogeneous servers [<xref rid="B29-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B39-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. An admission manager or load balancer is often modeled as a single server ahead of the computing servers [<xref rid="B25-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B27-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For the task/data arrival, most studies described the task/data flow by Poisson distribution. Researchers then build solutions by constructing and solving a CTMC. For example, Kafhali and Salah [<xref rid="B24-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] modeled the edge server by M/M/s/K queueing model. Pereira et al. [<xref rid="B25-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] proposed a queueing model for a Fog node containing a load balancer and several web servers to solve a closed-form solution. Liu et al. [<xref rid="B27-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] analyzed the user equipment (UE) side delay and server-side delay, respectively, from a perspective of task offloading and resource allocation. However, the above studies only proposed metrics such as utilization of VMs, average throughput, mean response time, average queue length, and discard rate. Measuring the above quantities fails to manifest whether the low-latency constraints of delay-sensitive applications are satisfied. To solve this problem, the PDF of sojourn time at the edge server needs to be obtained.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the above analyses based on queueing theory are all under the assumption that the edge node serves perfectly. However, the failure of a server or a VM can reduce the processing capability of the edge node directly and increase latency [<xref rid="B12-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B40-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. To model the failure and repair of VMs, VMs can be treated as unreliable and repairable queue servers based on the multi-server queueing models with unreliable and repairable servers [<xref rid="B20-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B26-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. For instance, Ke et al. [<xref rid="B26-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and Chakravarthy et al. [<xref rid="B23-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] analyzed multi-server queueing models considering unreliable servers and vacation policy. Although the unreliable and repairable servers in these queueing models are similar to VMs of the edge node, the present multi-server queueing models cannot be applied to model the edge computing servers directly. The reason is that the VM needs to migrate memory images and states before its recovery, resulting in down states for the migration and recovery that cannot be described by present models.</p>
      <p>To investigate the influence of VM migration on node delay, some researchers focused on the performance evaluation of VM migration [<xref rid="B12-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B40-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B42-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and latency-aware VM migration algorithms [<xref rid="B14-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B48-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In these studies, migration time and service downtime [<xref rid="B13-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] were measured to evaluate the performance of VM migration, yet how the migration time and service downtime influenced the sojourn time at the edge node has not been studied. For the latency analysis of edge computing, most studies focused on the delay of specific activities, such as processing, task offloading, and resource allocation [<xref rid="B52-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The total sojourn time at the edge node has not been well investigated. Liu et al. [<xref rid="B53-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] analyzed the influence of migration, but they only studied the probability that the computing system can provide sufficient VMs. The delay at the server was not analyzed.</p>
      <p>All this considered, present studies on VM delay did not investigate the influence of VM migration on the total delay at the VMs, for the queueing models of VMs ignored the failure and migration of VMs [<xref rid="B24-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B27-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and the VM migration delay was measured separately from the total delay [<xref rid="B12-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B42-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B44-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B53-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Meanwhile, due to the unique process of failure, migration, and recovery of VMs, present queueing models with unreliable servers [<xref rid="B20-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B26-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] cannot be directly applied to analyze the VM delay. To analyze the timely reliability of the VMs and the network, we build a queueing model considering the whole process of failure, migration, and recovery of VMs and propose a method to obtain the PDF of the delay at the edge server.</p>

      <title>2.3. End-to-End Timely Reliability Analysis</title>
      <p>There are two types of serial queueing models for the analysis of end-to-end delay, which are analytic models and approximate models. By traversal of the end-to-end topology, the end-to-end delay is obtained based on the delay in each node. Some researchers analyzed the situation of two queuing nodes, i.e., tandem queue [<xref rid="B54-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B57-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. However, due to the mathematical complexity, the formulation of the networked queueing model is infeasible when the queueing nodes are more than three. Therefore, approximation methods such as simulation [<xref rid="B18-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B59-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and the upper bound method [<xref rid="B60-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] are widely applied. Researchers also studied the end-to-end delay of queueing networks based on the departure process approximation. For instance, Xie and Haenggi [<xref rid="B28-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] defined a parameter to measure the spatial correlation between interfacing queueing nodes based on the departure process approximation. Although Kafhali and Salah [<xref rid="B24-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] proposed a serial M/M/s/K queueing model for an edge-cloud computing system based on Burke’s theorem, they did not analyze the end-to-end delay in the model. In addition, Jie Shen et al. [<xref rid="B61-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] proved that the end-to-end delay distribution of a network system is the inverse Laplace transform of the transfer function of the signal flow graph and proposed an end-to-end delay analysis method based on frequency domain. The end-to-end delay analysis considering the structure of the edge computing network is still lacking.</p>

    <title>3. Problem Description</title>
    <p>As depicted by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-21-00093-f001">Figure 1</xref>, the edge computing network is composed of four parts—sensor nodes, the edge server, the cloud gateway, and the cloud server. The task data generated by sensors are transmitted to the edge server for necessary processing by VMs, including pre-processing, analysis, compression, and encryption, over Bluetooth Low Energy, or Wi-Fi. After the processing at the VMs of the edge server, a part of tasks will be transmitted to the cloud server by the cloud gateway for global storage, power computing, or running various applications. Usually, a task expects to be processed within an extremely short time at the edge server to guarantee the real-time application. Differently, the cloud server can process a task in hours or days. Therefore, the delay at the VMs in the edge server and the delay through the whole network need to be analyzed, respectively. For the edge service, a task only needs to queue at the edge server. Whereas, for the cloud service, a task needs to go through three queues, which are the queue at the edge server, the queue at the cloud gateway, and the queue at the cloud server successively. According to the delay analysis, the definition of timely reliability is given by [<xref rid="B18-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]: <disp-formula id="FD1-sensors-21-00093"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="mm1"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>Pr</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mstyle mathsize="100%" displaystyle="true"><mml:mo>∫</mml:mo></mml:mstyle><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>

      <p>In an application, the task data need to be transmitted to the edge server and be processed by VMs within a delay constraint of <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm5"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. In the edge server, <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm6"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> VMs are assigned to process tasks, which are called task VMs (TVMs), and <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm7"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> idle VMs are assigned as backups, which are called backup VMs (BVM). All the VMs are homogeneous. Then, the total number of VMs is <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm8"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. The task flow is generated following a Poisson process at each sensor, where the arrival rate is <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm9"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. The service time of each VM follows an exponential distribution where the mean service time is <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm10"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. If the <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm11"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> VMs are all occupied, the task can be stored in the buffer, whose capacity is <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm12"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.

If the buffer is full as well, a discard occurs. We assume that the discarded tasks all violate the delay constraints and do not consider the retrial queue.</p>
      <p>When a VM fails, the task will be migrated to an idle VM and restart the processing, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-21-00093-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The migration downtime follows an exponential distribution where the mean service time is <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm14"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. Note that if all the other VMs are occupied or failed, the task will stay in the failed VM and wait for an idle VM to migrate. Extremely, when all the VMs are failed and not ready to reboot, to avoid deadlock of the VMs, the last failed VM can reboot without migration, reserving the un-migrated task. After the migration of the task, the failed VM can reboot and become an available VM again. If there are fewer than <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm15"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> VMs available (capable to process a task), the newly recovered VM will be assigned as a TVM; otherwise, it will be assigned as a BVM. The reboot time of VM follows an exponential distribution where the mean reboot time is <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm16"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. Then, each VM has three states: available, failed-unmigrated, and failed-migrated. Here, the available state refers to the state that the VM is capable to process a task. An available VM can be either idle or occupied. Transitions among the three states are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-21-00093-f003">Figure 3</xref>: (1) From ① to ②, the running VM fails, transiting from available to failed-unmigrated. (2) If there is at least one idle VM, the migration begins, or the failed VM needs to wait for an idle VM to migrate. When the migration completes, the edge server transits from ② to ③, where the failed VM is failed-migrated. (3) By rebooting, the failed-migrated VM can recover to be available again, edge server transiting from ③ to ①. If there are fewer than S VMs running, the newly recovered VM will be assigned as a TVM, or it will be assigned as a BVM. (4) At ①, when the TVMs are all occupied, the new arrival task will be waiting in the buffer, edge server transiting from ① to ④. If the buffer is full as well, a discard occurs. (5) At ④, if a VM completes the processing of a task and becomes an idle VM, the task waiting in the buffer will get into the idle VM for processing, edge server transiting from ④ to ①.</p>

      <p>We assume that the states violating Equation (2) exist in the CTMC and name them as pseudo-states. The transitions of pseudo-states are the same as the real states.

      <p>Consequently, the transitions inside a block are all triggered by state transitions of VM (failure, migration, and reboot). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-21-00093-f005">Figure 5</xref> shows transitions inside block <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm56"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.

Then, the sojourn time at the edge server approximately equals the time that the edge server transits from the non-empty states to the empty states when no new task arrives, which can be obtained by the first passage time method.

      <p>To calculate VTR, the key is to solve the CTMC with a state-space of high dimension and obtain the PDF of the sojourn time at the edge server. For this purpose, we need to propose an algorithm to formulate the partitioned generator matrix and obtain the PDF of the sojourn time at the edge server based on the first passage time method. The obtaining of PDF of the sojourn time at the edge server is described in Algorithm 1. After that, VTR and ETR can be calculated according to <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4dot2-sensors-21-00093">Section 4.2</xref>.

    <title>5. Results and Discussion</title>
    <p>In this section, we provide a case study of traffic monitoring for the proposed timely reliability evaluation method. Simulation results are obtained to verify our model and numerical results. We also investigate the influence of different factors on timely reliability, which helps design a better edge computing network.</p>
    <sec id="sec5dot1-sensors-21-00093">
      <title>5.1. Experimental Setup</title>
      <p>At a crossroads, the edge computing network for traffic monitoring consists of several sensors, an edge server, a cloud gateway, and a cloud server. The architecture of this network is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-21-00093-f001">Figure 1</xref>. To monitor the traffic at this crossroads, the sensors collect task data in real-time and transmit the tasks to the edge server, where the tasks are processed by VMs. In addition, a part of processed tasks is transmitted to the cloud server through the cloud gateway for further process or storage. The parameters used in this case are shown in <xref rid="sensors-21-00093-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The data on sensor data refer to [<xref rid="B65-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B66-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The data on VM migration refer to [<xref rid="B40-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The data on system failure refer to [<xref rid="B10-sensors-21-00093" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec5dot2-sensors-21-00093">
      <title>5.2. Simulation Experiments</title>
      <p>The numerical results are verified by simulation based on OMNeT++ (V5.5.1), a C++ network simulation library and framework. We choose OMNeT++ for its open source and extensible features. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-21-00093-f008">Figure 8</xref> shows the simulation model in OMNeT++. In the simulation model, the sensors are modeled by the Wireless Host Module; the buffer of the edge server is modeled by the Passive Queue Module; the VMs of the edge server are modeled by the Server Module; the cloud gateway is modeled by the Passive Queue Module; the cloud server is modeled by the Cloud Module. Particularly, to model the migration time of the VM migration, a Downtime Generator (DG), modeled by the Passive Queue Module, is employed to connect the edge servers and VMs. Once a running VM fails, the task on this VM will be migrated to an idle VM through the DG, where a migration downtime of an exponential distribution is needed. Notably, the tasks spend no time to pass the DG unless it is on the way of migration. As soon as the migrating task arrives at the destination VM, the failed VM becomes failed-migrated, and its rebooting can begin. The values of the parameters are the same as those in <xref rid="sensors-21-00093-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>.</p>

Thus, if the migration time and reboot time are quite short, the designers do not need to be very rigid on the reliability of VMs. Conversely, if the migration time and reboot time are relatively long, designers can improve VTR of the edge computing network effectively by reducing the failure rate of VMs.</p>

        <title>5.3.2. Analysis of the Number of VMs</title>
        <p>The number of TVMs and BVMs are also influential factors of VTR. Results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-21-00093-f013">Figure 13</xref>a show that VTR is higher with the increase in the number of TVMs when the failure rate is high. The reason is that more VMs mean the server can process more tasks at the same time. However, when the failure rate is low, we have an interesting finding that VTR monotonically decreases as the number of TVMs grows, such as the cases when the failure rate equals 0.0002 or 0.0004 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-21-00093-f013">Figure 13</xref>a. In fact, the increase in the number of TVMs influences VTR by two means, i.e., (1) reducing the end-to-end delay by processing more tasks at the same time and (2) increasing the end-to-end delay by bringing about more failure, migration, and reboot of VMs in a given time. The second impact is more significant when the failure rate is high. Whereas when the failure rate is low, the first impact is more significant. Similar results are shown by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-21-00093-f013">Figure 13</xref>b, where with no BVM or extremely few BVMs, VTR monotonically increases as the number of TVMs grows, indicating that the first impact is more significant. However, with more BVMs, VTR monotonically decreases as the number of TVMs grows, indicating that the second impact is more significant. Therefore, the increase in TVMs is not always a good choice for improving VTR.</p>
        <p>According to the above findings, the resource manager can allocate an appropriate number of TVMs according to the above-mentioned analysis, which can be a guidance for the initial configuration of VMs. As for the number of BVMs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-21-00093-f014">Figure 14</xref> shows that VTR monotonically increases as the number of BVM grows.</p>

        <title>5.3.3. Management of VMs</title>
        <p>Since the increase in the number of TVMs and the number of BVMs both improve VTR generally, to achieve the highest VTR, there is a trade-off between the number of TVMs and the number of BVMs when the total number of VMs is limited. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-21-00093-f015">Figure 15</xref>a reveals that when the failure rate of VM is low, only assigning one VM as TVM is the best solution. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-21-00093-f015">Figure 15</xref>b shows that when the failure rate is high, more VMs should be assigned as TVMs to achieve the highest VTR. Therefore, to achieve the highest VTR, based on the analysis method of this paper, the resource manager can find the optimal allocation of VMs according to the related parameters of the edge computing network and the tasks.</p>

    <title>6. Conclusions</title>
    <p>In this paper, we analyzed the VTR and the ETR of the edge computing network, considering the failure, migration, and reboot of VMs. To model the state transitions of VMs, we define three states of VMs (available, fail-unmigrated, fail-migrated) and construct a partitioned CTMC for the edge server. We express the generator matrix as a partitioned matrix based on the matrix-geometric method. An algorithm is proposed to resolve the CTMC and obtain the sojourn time at the edge server as well as VTR. Moreover, to analyze ETR of the network, we build the delay analysis model based on Burke’s theorem and propose an end-to-end delay analysis method. The proposed method is more eligible to model the multi-state system of VMs. When the dimension of CTMC states is high, the constructing method of the generator matrix proposed in this paper can effectively reduce the difficulty of algorithm designing.</p>
    <p>We investigate VTR of the edge computing network under different conditions. The numerical results are verified to be correct by simulation based on OMNeT++. Results show that VTR is a monotonic function of the migration rate, reboot rate of VM, the number of TVMs, and the number of BVMs. However, in some cases, the increase in TVMs may conversely decrease VTR, since more TVMs also bring about more failures in a given time. Moreover, we find that there is a trade-off between the number of TVMs and the number of BVMs when the total number of VMs is limited. The resource manager can find the optimal allocation of VMs according to the migration rate, reboot rate, failure rate, etc., of the edge computing network and the arrive rate, computation complexity, etc., of the tasks. Based on the trade-off of TVMs and BVMs, in future research, we will further study the optimization of computing resources to obtain a better performance of the edge server. We will also study the case when the sizes of task data are different in future work.</p>
