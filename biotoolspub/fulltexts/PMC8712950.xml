      <p>Identifying the protein complexes in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks is essential for understanding cellular organization and biological processes. To address the high false positive/negative rates of PPI networks and detect protein complexes with multiple topological structures, we developed a novel improved memetic algorithm (IMA). IMA first combines the topological and biological properties to obtain a weighted PPI network with reduced noise. Next, it integrates various clustering results to construct the initial populations. Furthermore, a fitness function is designed based on the five topological properties of the protein complexes. Finally, we describe the rest of our IMA method, which primarily consists of four steps: selection operator, recombination operator, local optimization strategy, and updating the population operator. In particular, IMA is a combination of genetic algorithm and a local optimization strategy, which has a strong global search ability, and searches for local optimal solutions effectively. The experimental results demonstrate that IMA performs much better than the base methods and existing state-of-the-art techniques. The source code and datasets of the IMA can be found at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/RongquanWang/IMA" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/RongquanWang/IMA</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>Many complex systems in the real world are often modeled with complex networks, such as computer networks, social networks, and biological networks. The detection of community structure is an essential property of complex networks, and it helps us understand the structure and functionally of complex networks. Protein complexes mined from the PPI network are representative of detecting community structure in complex networks. In proteomics, proteins rarely act alone, and often organize together to form protein complexes to perform specific biological functions cooperatively (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Spirin and Mirny, 2003</xref>). Therefore, accurately identifying protein complexes from PPI networks can contribute to the study of the mechanisms of cellular functions and organization (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Gavin et al., 2002</xref>) in the post-genomic era. Although some experimental methods such as yeast two-hybrid and tandem affinity purification can detect protein complexes, they have limitations. Specifically, they are expensive and time-consuming. With the development of high-throughput experimental technologies, many PPI networks are now available. The computational methods developed complement the experimental techniques in identifying protein complexes. As a result, many computational methods have been proposed for the identification of protein complexes from PPI networks, which is a type of cluster analysis, which consists of grouping patterns into clusters based on the similarity, and it is a valuable technology in many areas such as bioinformatics, machine learning, and computer vision.</p>
    <p>To date, a variety of computational methods for detecting protein complexes in PPI networks have been proposed. Based on our work, we provide a summary of the related works by classifying the existing methods into three types: methods based on reducing noise, methods based on different topological structures, and methods based on evolutionary algorithms.</p>
    <p>Because the PPI networks are derived from high-throughput experiments, the high false positive and false negative rates in the PPI networks are high (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Von Mering et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Samanta and Liang, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Srihari, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Zaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Lei et al., 2018</xref>), which substantially affects the accuracy of protein complex identification. To reduce the influence of noise, some methods utilize various network topological properties for strong interactions and identify protein complexes. These algorithms include PEWCC (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Zaki et al., 2013</xref>), ProRank+ (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Hanna and Zaki, 2014</xref>), and EWCA (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019a</xref>). Alternatively, some studies have attempted to integrate the gene expression data (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Keretsu and Sarmah, 2016</xref>), gene ontology data (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>), and subcellular localization data (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) to improve the reliability of the interactions. These studies mainly use biological data to weight protein interactions and compensate the PPI network, which better reflects the real protein interactions. DPCT (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">SabziNezhad and Jalili, 2020</xref>) uses TAP and GO data to construct a weighted PPI network and to reduce the noise of PPI, and a memetic algorithm to detect protein complexes. <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Valdeolivas et al. (2019)</xref> extended the Random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm to multiplex and heterogeneous networks. This framework performs better as compared to the aggregation of the different interaction sources and the multiplex framework is more efficient than network aggregations to extract communities from biological networks. <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Blatti et al. (2020)</xref> presented Knowledge Engine for Genomics (KnowEnG), it is a free-to-use computational system for analysis of genomics data sets, it provides the standard clustering pipeline to cluster a collection of samples. However, further reducing the impact of random noise in PPI networks, and improving the performance of protein complex detection methods remain urgent problems to be solved.</p>
    <p>In recent years, various computational methods based on different topological structures have been developed to detect protein complexes in PPI networks. Among these methods, different types of topological structures are commonly assumed to be protein complexes. Some methods partition proteins into many non-overlapping clusters by using partition functions or principles. For example, Markov Clustering (MCL) (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Van Dongen, 2000</xref>) is a simulated random walk method, which mainly uses expansion and inflation operators to manipulate the adjacency matrix and mine protein complexes from the PPI networks. Meanwhile, RNSC (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">King et al., 2004</xref>) first moves the proteins randomly among the clusters to optimize the cost function, and then a post process, based on cluster size, density, and functional homogeneity is carried out. Some methods aim to find cliques. In 2006, CFinder (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">King et al., 2004</xref>) was developed to cluster proteins in the PPI network, and it used the concept of k-clique to discover protein complexes. In 2009, CMC (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2009</xref>) tried to enumerate cliques in the PPI network for discovering protein complexes, but it was too strict for most protein complexes. Therefore, several methods based on density have been designed to identify dense subgraphs in the PPI networks, where subgraphs with densities above a pre-defined threshold were considered as protein complexes. For example, MCODE (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bader and Hogue, 2003</xref>) first weighted every node by local neighborhood density and then extended locally dense nodes to detect protein complexes. Later, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. (2008)</xref> improved the seed-extended method by modifying the DPClus algorithm based on the diameter and density of the local graph. Furthermore, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Gavin et al. (2006)</xref> proposed that protein complexes have the core-attachment structure, and some identification methods based on the core-attachment structure. For example, COACH (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2009</xref>) and WPNCA (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Peng et al., 2014</xref>) have been proposed to find protein complexes. They first extracted the protein complex cores from the neighborhood graphs of the proteins, and protein complex cores were further extended to form complete protein complexes. Finally, some protein complexes with a high overlap were merged. There are some variants of network topological features that are used to detect protein complexes; these studies (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Nepusz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Giurgiu et al., 2019</xref>) have shown that proteins in a protein complex commonly display strong interactions within the core of the protein complex, and weak interactions with the proteins outer surface of the protein complex, ClusterONE (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Nepusz et al., 2012</xref>) starts from a seed node and inserts neighbors into it to form overlapping protein complexes by using cohesiveness. Subsequently, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2019b)</xref> proposed a novel seed-expand algorithm called SE-DMTG to identify protein complexes with a combinatorial function from the weighted PPI networks. Additionally, based on the 3-sigma principle (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), MPC-C (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) identifies the active points of proteins in a time serial of gene expression data and generates a series of time-sequenced subnetworks to identify static and dynamic protein complexes. In 2021, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. (2021)</xref> proposed a protein complex detection methods based on a semi-supervised model to detect protein complexes with clear module structures. A number of computational methods only consider single topological properties to identify protein complexes, and they recover protein complexes with other types of topological structures.</p>
    <p>Intensive studies on evolutionary algorithms have also been conducted. In recent years, some researchers have provided new ideas for solving protein complex identification problems by using optimized algorithms, by employing the characteristics of highly adaptive and good optimization abilities. Some successful methods have been applied to tackle the problems of identifying protein complexes and efficiency. In 2015, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Ramadan et al. (2016)</xref> introduced a genetic algorithm to detect protein complexes. Subsequently, in 2016, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Lei et al. (2016)</xref> presented F-MCL based on Markov clustering and the firefly method, which automatically determines the parameters by using the firefly method. In the same year, a novel fruit fly optimization clustering method was designed to detect dynamic protein complexes (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Lei et al., 2016</xref>). In 2017, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. (2017)</xref> proposed a new firefly clustering algorithm for transforming the protein complex detection problem into an optimization problem. <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. (2017)</xref> proposed a novel improved cuckoo search clustering method for discovering protein complexes in dynamic weighted PPI networks. In 2019, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Lei et al. (2019b)</xref> used a nature-inspired optimization method to detect protein complexes. In 2019, a moth-flame-optimization-based protein complex detection method was presented (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Lei et al., 2019a</xref>). In 2020, an evolutionary algorithm based on a heuristic biological operator was introduced to detect protein complexes (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abduljabbar et al., 2020</xref>). These evolutionary methods have a strong global search ability, but they have difficulty in locating the local optima efficiently.</p>
    <p>To solve these issues, we present a novel algorithm, named IMA, which uses an improved memetic algorithm we designed to detect protein complexes from the PPI network. First, we constructed a weighted PPI network by using the common neighbor, gene expression data, GO-slim data, and subcellular location data to reduce the impact of noise on our IMA. Second, many high-quality initial individuals, including protein complexes with different topological structures, are generated using EWCA (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019a</xref>), SE-DMTG (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>), and MPC-C (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). We propose a fitness function to identify protein complexes with various topological properties. Third, a new improved memetic algorithm is proposed to mine the protein complexes by optimizing this fitness function in the weighted PPI network. Remarkably, its selection, recombination, and updating population operators are used for the global search of the best individual, and a local optimization strategy is designed to locate the local optima individually. Finally, our IMA was applied to four different yeast PPI networks and compared with the 12 existing excellent methods. The experimental results illustrate that the IMA achieves state-of-the-art performance of computational metrics and biological relevance metrics in identifying protein complexes.</p>
    <p>In the materials and methods section, we introduce the datasets and standard protein complexes used in the evaluation of IMA and define all phases of IMA separately. In the experiments and results section, we evaluated the proposed method and compare it with the state-of-the-art methods. The case study and discussion section shows some examples of protein complexes detected by IMA and we conclude this paper in conclusion section.</p>

        <p>Since PPI networks are defined using graph-theoretic concepts, we first provide some of the terminologies used in our paper and then describe the IMA method in detail.</p>
        <p>A PPI network can be represented as an undirected graph <italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>, <italic>E</italic>), where <italic>V</italic> is the set of vertices (individual proteins) and <italic>E</italic> is the set of edges (protein interactions) between the vertices. The neighbors of <italic>v</italic> in <italic>G</italic>, denoted by <italic>N</italic>(<italic>v</italic>), are the set of vertices adjacent to <italic>v</italic>.</p>
        <p>Biologically, protein complexes are groups of proteins that interact with each other at the same time and place, forming a single multi-molecular machine. However, due to the inherent topological structures of protein complexes (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Nepusz et al., 2012</xref>) in PPI networks, protein complexes are usually assumed to be the subgraphs of PPI networks. Let <italic>C</italic> = (<italic>V</italic>

          <title>2.2.2.1 Constructing a Weighted PPI Network</title>
          <p>Many studies (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Lei et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2019b</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) have shown that the performance of protein complex identification methods can be improved by integrating multiple data sources into a single weighted PPI network, which enhances the confidence of interactions in PPI networks. Thus, we integrated the topological structures and multiple biological data to weight the interactions in the PPI networks. Our goal was to weight the edges of the PPI network to reflect the reliability of the corresponding interactions. Graph clustering algorithms can use these weights to reduce the influence of noisy edges and yield meaningful clusters.</p>

          <p>A memetic algorithm (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2014</xref>) is typically a hybrid-local heuristic search method used for optimization. Generally, memetic algorithms consist of a genetic algorithm and local optimization strategy. Here, the genetic algorithm is the global search method, which can explore a reliable estimate of the global optimum, but it does not obtain an optimal individual in the explored search space quickly. Therefore, the local optimal search strategy is typically used to accelerate searching and find the best individual in the local search space. In this paper, we present an improved memetic algorithm that can create new individuals that are located in new promising regions in the global search space and search around the newly generated individuals to optimize individuals of better quality (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Gach and Hao, 2012</xref>).</p>

            <p>The memetic algorithm is a valuable framework for dealing with combinatorial optimization problems. It provides a good balance between searching for diversification and optimization by employing a genetic algorithm and the local optimization strategy (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Žalik and Žalik, 2018</xref>). We designed a fitness function to evaluate the quality of the clusters. In addition, we propose a recombination operator and local optimization strategy for detecting protein complexes in the PPI network. Our goal is to maximize the individual’s <italic>FS</italic>
<sub><italic>fitness</italic></sub> (see <xref rid="e13" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 13</xref>) using an improved memetic algorithm. <xref rid="Algorithm_1" ref-type="statement">Algorithm 1</xref> is the main framework of IMA.

            <p>IMA begins with initial populations (line 1, see section generating the initial population) and then repeats an iterative procedure many times (generations) (lines 3–18). Two parent individuals in the current population are selected using a tournament selection strategy for each generation (line 4, see section selection operator). Two new children individuals were generated based on two selected parents using the recombination operator (line 5, see section recombination operator). Then, we select the children with the highest fitness function (line 6, see section fitness function: <xref rid="e13" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 13</xref>), and if its fitness function is larger than the 80<italic>%</italic> fitness of the individual with the maximum fitness, it is further improved using the local optimization strategy we proposed (line 7–11, see section local optimization strategy). Finally, a roulette wheel selection strategy is used to update the population (line 12, see section updating population operator). The individual with the highest fitness function (line 13, <xref rid="e13" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 13</xref>) mined during the search process is always recorded (lines 14–16). The entire IMA stops when <italic>iter</italic> consecutive generations (line 3, <italic>Max</italic>

            <title>2.2.2.3.2 Generating Initial Population</title>
            <p>As we know, most of existing protein complex detection methods are based on unsupervised learning, and they can only identify protein complexes with a single topology. However, real protein complexes have a variety of topologies. That is why we proposed the IMA. In fact, IMA algorithm is a typical swarm intelligence optimization algorithm, which needs to build an initial population <italic>P</italic>. In order to build an initial population, we should follow two basic requirements: 1) The individuals in the initial population should be high quality. It means that the protein complex detection method should produce the high accuracy initial population; 2) Individuals in the initial population need to be diverse. Obtaining initial population method should identify the protein complexes with different topological structures. Based on the above two points, we choose EWCA (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019a</xref>), SE-DMTG (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>) and MPC-C (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) as the methods to generate the initial population.</p>
            <p>In fact, according to their references, we can see that these three algorithms not only have high protein complex detection accuracy, but also can identify the protein complexes with different topological structures. And their advantageous than other existing methods are shown in their literatures (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). For example, EWCA can identify protein complexes with core-attachment structure, SE-DMTG can identify protein complexes with high density and modularity and MPC-C can predict static protein complexes and dynamic protein complexes with community structure. Moreover, the identification accuracy of these three algorithms is also excellent in the existing algorithms. Therefore, they can ensure the generation of protein complexes with high quality and different topological structures. That is why we chose these algorithms.</p>
            <p>The first approach is the EWCA, which generates <italic>o</italic> individuals by using different values of <italic>ss</italic> (structural similarity) threshold and ranges from 0.3 to 0.62 with 0.04 increment. The second approach is the SE-DMTG algorithm, which generates <italic>o</italic> individuals by randomly constructing seed queues, and then uses its seed-extended algorithm to generate individuals. The last method is the MPC-C algorithm, which is used to construct <italic>o</italic> individuals by setting different values of the filter <italic>Score</italic>(<italic>C</italic>) cutoff (from 0.1 to 0.8 with a step size of 0.1). Finally, we obtain <italic>Pop</italic> = 3 × <italic>o</italic> individuals and combine them to create the initial population, where the parameter <italic>o</italic> is 8.</p>

            <title>2.2.2.3.3 Fitness Function</title>
            <p>We first define the fitness function of the IMA method; this fitness function should reflect the topological properties of protein complexes in PPI networks. Generally, a high-quality protein complex is a group of proteins that are densely interconnected but only sparsely connected with the rest of the PPI network (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Nepusz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Meanwhile, in identifying various topological properties of protein complexes, the combination of multiple single objective functions can compensate for the shortcomings of a single objective function, which leads to an improved quality of the identified protein complexes. Therefore, we propose a multi-objective function (<xref rid="e12" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 12</xref>) by integrating five objective functions (<xref rid="e7" ref-type="disp-formula">Eqs 7</xref>–<xref rid="e11" ref-type="disp-formula">11</xref> to describe the topological properties of protein complexes: <italic>cohesiveness</italic>(<italic>C</italic>), <italic>density</italic>(<italic>C</italic>), <italic>AIEW</italic>(<italic>C</italic>), <italic>ABEW</italic>(<italic>C</italic>), and <italic>AWM</italic>(<italic>C</italic>).</p>

            <p>The selection operator is an essential operation used in the memetic algorithm. The main idea of the selection strategy is that the better an individual, the higher is its chance of being a parent. In the IMA algorithm, the recombination operator and updating population operator need individual selection strategies.</p>
            <p>In the parent selection operator, a selection strategy is required to select two parent individuals from the current population to generate individual children. The fundamental principle of this operation is that individuals with a higher fitness function are more likely to be selected as parent individuals. Here, we use a binary tournament selection strategy to select the parent individuals. Meanwhile, the recombination operator also uses a binary tournament selection strategy to select protein complexes from composite parent individuals to create individual children.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the population updating strategy needs to update the population according to the fitness of individuals in current population and generate children individuals. In this updating process, we use the roulette wheel selection strategy to update the current population to balance the relatively good individuals and avoid precocity.</p>

            <title>2.2.2.3.5 Recombination Operator</title>
            <p>The recombination operator is the critical diversification mechanism of memetic algorithm. An effective recombination operator should generate not only diversified solutions but also transfer significant components from parents to children (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Hao, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2014</xref>). The recombination operator is responsible for combining the genetic material of several individuals (usually two individuals) to create a new children (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Spears and De Jong, 1995</xref>). New children inherit many high-quality protein complexes from their parents. Additionally, the recombination operator plays a vital role in the effectiveness of the memetic algorithm in the global search space. Traditional recombination operators, having uniform crossover and two-point crossover, are challenging to convey the excellent protein complexes of two parents to a new children simultaneously. This method is less suitable for protein complex detection. Therefore, we present a recombination operator based on the fitness function, whose children can inherit the better protein complexes of their parents. This operator plays an essential role in preventing the algorithm from being trapped in an optimal local solution and exploring the global search space. The main idea of this operator is to take the protein complexes from two parents as the genetic material and try to retain the high-quality protein complexes in parents for the new children. The recombination operator is described in <xref rid="Algorithm_2" ref-type="statement">Algorithm 2</xref>.</p>

            <p>To improve the quality of the generated offspring, we presented a new local optimization strategy to obtain better offspring. This strategy is different from the general sense of local search strategies, such as the hill-climbing strategy and simulated annealing strategy. The purpose of the local optimization strategy is to obtain offspring of relatively high quality. Here, each protein complex in children is optimized using a multi-objective function (<xref rid="e12" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 12</xref>) and a local optimization strategy.

The roulette wheel selection strategy can balance the diversity of the population and guarantee that individuals with higher fitness always have a greater probability of being retained in the population.</p>

      <title>3.2 The Effects of Parameters</title>
      <p>IMA includes two parameters which need to be tuned:Generations(MaxIter) and Population size (Pop). Pop controls the number of initial population by EWCA, SE-DMTG, MPC-C. MaxIter determines the number of iterations of population optimization. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> show how performance is influenced by these parameters in three PPI networks and two standard protein complexes.</p>

      <p>Effect of Pop. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows how Total score changes with the value of Pop. We can see that Total score is not very sensitive to Pop, especially when Pop falls in [6, 10]. So in our experiments, Pop is set to 8 by default.</p>
      <p>Effect of MaxIter. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows the changing trend of Total score when MaxIter increases from 40 to 80. We can see that for the three PINs, the fluctuations of Total score are not significant. In our experiments, we set MaxIter = 60 by default.</p>
      <p>According to <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, we can see that the Total score is not very sensitive to the changing trend of MaxIter and Pop, so we only set MaxIter = 60 and Pop = 8 as the default value. To avoid evaluation bias and overestimation of the performance, we do not tune the parameter to a particular dataset and set them as the default value in the all experiments.

        <title>3.2.1 Comparison With Competitive Algorithms</title>
        <p>To demonstrate the performance of the IMA, we compared it with 12 state-of-the-art methods. These include MCODE (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bader and Hogue, 2003</xref>), MCL (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Van Dongen, 2000</xref>), IPCA (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2008</xref>), COACH (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2009</xref>), ClusterONE (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Nepusz et al., 2012</xref>), PEWCC (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Zaki et al., 2013</xref>), ProRank+ (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Hanna and Zaki, 2014</xref>), WPNCA (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Peng et al., 2014</xref>), WEC (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Keretsu and Sarmah, 2016</xref>), EWCA (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019a</xref>), SE-DMTG (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>), and MPC-C (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). The total score is used for a more comprehensive evaluation of the different methods. We obtained the software implementations for all the compared methods, and their parameters are shown in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Although better results could probably be obtained by fine-tuning these parameters, we only use default or suggestion thresholds to maintain the fairness of different algorithms.</p>

        <p>First, we compared them with the standard protein complexes 1. As shown in <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, IMA outperformed the other algorithms on the Krogan dataset. IMA obtained a F-measure of 0.6272, CR of 0.3917, MMR of 0.3266, Jaccard of 0.4373, and total score of 2.0688, which were obviously superior to other detection algorithms. MCL predicted 370 protein complexes and achieved the highest ACC of 0.3192. Second, we compared the 13 approaches using the DIP dataset. IMA detected 1338 protein complexes, and achieved the highest F-measure, MMR, Jaccard, and Total scores, respectively. ClusterONE found 904 protein complexes and achieved a CR of 0.5062 and ACC of 0.3270, the best performance in terms of CR and ACC. However, it only achieved a F-measure of 0.5118, MMR of 0.1467, Jaccard of 0.3297, and total score of 1.8214, which were lower than those obtained using the IMA method. Second, we compared our IMA and other methods using the combined6 dataset. <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows than the results obtained by using combined6 dataset are similar to those obtained using the DIP dataset. IMA detected 1054 protein complexes and achieved the highest F-measure, MMR, Jaccard, and total score with values of 0.7256, 0.3364, 0.4869, and 2.3052, respectively. IPCA found 2160 protein complexes and achieved a better CR of 0.5106. ClusterONE predicted 648 protein complexes, achieving a ACC of 0.3306, which was the highest. Finally, we also used the WI-PHI dataset to evaluate the performance of all methods, and IMA identified 2561 protein complexes, and IMA scores of F-measure, CR, MMR, Jaccard, and total score were higher than those determined by the other methods, and they were 0.7503, 0.6223, 0.3965, 0.4828, and 2.5579, respectively. As for the ACC, which is among the top three, only lower than SE-DMTG and ClusterONE. From the above analysis, we found that the IMA algorithm achieved the best performance in the most evaluation metrics, with the exception of CR and ACC in some cases. Therefore, these results demonstrate that the IMA outperforms the base and could be an excellent approach to detect protein complexes in PPI networks. More evaluation metrics are made available in the <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/RongquanWang/IMA/Additional" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/RongquanWang/IMA/Additional</ext-link> file 2.</p>
        <p>The comparison results obtained using standard protein complexes 2 in <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> are basically consistent with those obtained using standard protein complexes 1 in <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. This means that the performance of the proposed IMA is relatively stable. The IMA algorithm performs significantly well on four PPI networks, and it is competitive with the other algorithms in term of computational evaluation metrics. Additionally, in order to further verify the performance of our IMA algorithm, we also use CYC2008 protein complex dataset and MIPS protein complex dataset to evaluate these identification algorithms. The evaluation results are shown in <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/RongquanWang/IMA/Additional" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/RongquanWang/IMA/Additional</ext-link> file 4. From the experimental results, we can see that the performance of IMA algorithm on CYC2008 protein complex dataset and MIPS protein complex dataset is basically consistent with the performance on two datasets (standard protein complexes 1 and standard protein complexes 2). This experimental results show that IMA algorithm has strong adaptability and stability to different standard protein complexes.</p>

      <title>3.3 Comparison With Functional Enrichment Analysis</title>
      <p>We needed to conduct a multi-angle analysis for this statistic, because the <italic>p</italic>-value of the identified protein complexes is closely related to the size of the identified protein complexes (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>). For this purpose, the number of detected protein complexes (Num), the number of significantly identified protein complexes, and the percentage of significantly identified protein complexes with different <italic>p</italic>-values from 1E-2 to 1E-20 were used to analyze their functional enrichment. We used a <italic>p</italic>-value test to analyze the protein complexes discovered by the IMA, MCODE, MCL, IPCA, COACH, ClusterONE, PEWCC, ProRank+, WPNCA, WEC, EWCA, SE-DMTG, and MPC-C. The results of the <italic>p</italic>-values of these methods are shown in <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>.</p>

      <p>As shown in <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, the number of protein complexes that could be significantly detected by IMA was higher than that determined by the other methods in the four PPI networks. This means that IMA can detect more protein complexes with biological significance compared to other methods. Although some detected protein complexes do not match standard protein complexes currently, they are likely to be real protein complexes. As for the percentage of significantly detected protein complexes at different thresholds of the <italic>p</italic>-value from E-2 to E-20 in <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, we can conclude that IMA could detect a relatively higher proportion of protein complexes with biologically significance in most PPI networks. The above analysis demonstrates that the IMA method could be a promising method for discovering new protein complexes with biological significance.</p>

      <title>3.4 Comparison With Subcellular Location Score</title>
      <p>According to the definition of colocalization score, it is based on the average colocalization of all detected protein complexes. It should be noted that the lower the number of detected protein complexes, the higher the colocalization score. Here, we used the ProCope tool (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Krumsiek et al., 2008</xref>) to calculate the colocalization score.</p>
      <p><xref rid="T7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref> shows the average co-localization scores of protein complexes detected using various methods on localization dataset, (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Huh et al., 2003</xref>). In Krogan, the best co-localization score of 0.7442 is obtained by the MCODE method, but MCODE only detected 39 predicted protein complexes, which was beneficial for achieving high the co-localization score, and IMA obtained a score of 0.7351, lower than MCODE. In DIP, ProRank + detected 357 protein complexes and obtained a co-localization score of 0.6933, which was better than that of all the other methods. In combined6, IMA method detected 1054 detected protein complexes and achieved the highest the co-localization score of 0.7440. In WI-PHI, IMA achieved the highest co-localization score, and the number of protein complexes was 2561. Based on the co-localization score of the detected protein complexes by IMA, it indicates that the proteins of protein complexes predicted by IMA have better localization consistency; these proteins in the same protein complex tend to carry out a similar function.</p>

    <title>4 Case Study and Discussion</title>
    <p>IMA algorithm can detect protein complexes with multiple topological structures. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> shows some examples of the detected protein complexes with different topological structures by using the IMA algorithm. Note that the standard protein complexes 1 and 2 are also detected by the IMA algorithm. These protein complexes contain the number of proteins between 3 and 14. These protein complexes with different topological structures include linear, triangular, star-like, rectangular, k-clique, dense subgraph, and core-attachment structure, and hybrid structure. Proteins that have binary interactions are connected by dashed lines. More examples can be found them at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/RongquanWang/IMA/Examples" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/RongquanWang/IMA/Examples</ext-link>.</p>

    <p>From <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, we can see that SE-DMTG correctly identifies 14 proteins, but misidentifies a protein. Moreover, the other methods have inaccurately proteins. Our IMA can correctly identify almost all proteins, which suggests that the IMA algorithm is superior to the other comparative methods.</p>

    <title>5 Conclusion</title>
    <p>In this paper, we present a novel IMA method for identifying protein complexes in PPI network. The key idea of IMA is enabled us to design an improved memetic algorithm to optimize a fitness function for identifying protein complexes in PPI networks based on existing contending methods and a weighted PPI network. Here, an improved memetic algorithm is the cooperation of a genetic algorithm with a local optimization strategy. A genetic algorithm is used to improve the diversity of the population, and the local optimization strategy helps to locate better solutions more quickly. Furthermore, we designed a fitness function to overcome the limitations of a single objective function in estimating an individual’s fitness. The experimental results show that IMA significantly outperforms the existing outstanding algorithms in various metrics. We will use graph neural networks (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>) and other evolutionary algorithms to improve the accuracy of protein complexes identified in the future.</p>
