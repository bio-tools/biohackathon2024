      <p>Deciphering the interplay between chromatin accessibility and transcription factor (TF) binding is fundamental to understanding transcriptional regulation, control of cellular states, and the establishment of new phenotypes. Recent genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiling studies have provided catalogs of putative open regions, where TFs can recognize their motifs and regulate gene expression programs. Here, we present motif enrichment in differential elements of accessibility (MEDEA), a computational tool that analyzes high-throughput chromatin accessibility genomic data to identify cell-type-specific accessible regions and lineage-specific motifs associated with TF binding therein. To benchmark MEDEA, we used a panel of reference cell lines profiled by ENCODE and curated by the ENCODE Project Consortium for the ENCODE-DREAM Challenge. By comparing results with RNA-seq data, ChIP-seq peaks, and DNase-seq footprints, we show that MEDEA improves the detection of motifs associated with known lineage specifiers. We then applied MEDEA to 610 ENCODE DNase-seq data sets, where it revealed significant motifs even when absolute enrichment was low and where it identified novel regulators, such as NRF1 in kidney development. Finally, we show that MEDEA performs well on both bulk and single-cell ATAC-seq data. MEDEA is publicly available as part of our Glossary-GENRE suite for motif enrichment analysis.</p>

  <p>In eukaryotic development, gene transcription happens in precise spatiotemporal patterns that require the specific binding of highly regulated transcription factors (TFs) to dynamically accessible <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements. The majority of the approximately 1500 TFs present in the human genome are up-regulated in a tissue-specific and cell-type-specific manner (<xref rid="GR260877MARC78" ref-type="bibr">Vaquerizas et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC40" ref-type="bibr">Lambert et al. 2018</xref>). The ectopic expression of a combination of fewer than 10 TFs is often sufficient to drive differentiation and reprograming (<xref rid="GR260877MARC61" ref-type="bibr">Riddell et al. 2014</xref>). The precise identification of lineage specifiers, their regulators, and their binding sites is crucial for understanding how the genome encodes the regulation of gene expression programs and cellular functions.</p>
  <p>Several sequencing-based techniques for genomic profiling of chromatin accessibility (e.g., DNase-seq [<xref rid="GR260877MARC67" ref-type="bibr">Song and Crawford 2010</xref>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC33" ref-type="bibr">John et al. 2013</xref>], FAIRE-seq [<xref rid="GR260877MARC51" ref-type="bibr">Nagy et al. 2003</xref>], ATAC-seq [<xref rid="GR260877MARC4" ref-type="bibr">Buenrostro et al. 2013</xref>]) or nucleosome occupancy (e.g., MNase-seq [<xref rid="GR260877MARC9" ref-type="bibr">Cui and Zhao 2012</xref>]) have been developed (for a comparative review, see <xref rid="GR260877MARC76" ref-type="bibr">Tsompana and Buck 2014</xref>). Some of them are widely used both by large consortia to map the human epigenome in a high-throughput manner (<xref rid="GR260877MARC74" ref-type="bibr">Thurman et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC62" ref-type="bibr">Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al. 2015</xref>) and by an increasing number of laboratories to characterize chromatin accessibility in specific cell types and cellular conditions. Of these, ATAC-seq is currently the most versatile assay because it simultaneously identifies open chromatin regions and nucleosomes, is suitable for single-cell applications (<xref rid="GR260877MARC5" ref-type="bibr">Buenrostro et al. 2015</xref>), and requires both less input material (<xref rid="GR260877MARC4" ref-type="bibr">Buenrostro et al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="GR260877MARC5" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC8" ref-type="bibr">Corces et al. 2018</xref>) and less sample handling. However, thus far, there are considerably fewer ATAC-seq data sets currently available than the extensive DNase-seq data sets produced by large consortia, such as ENCODE and the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium (<xref rid="GR260877MARC14" ref-type="bibr">The ENCODE Project Consortium 2012</xref>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC74" ref-type="bibr">Thurman et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC62" ref-type="bibr">Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al. 2015</xref>). These DNase-seq data sets have enabled the cataloging of open chromatin regions in a wide variety of human cell types (<xref rid="GR260877MARC74" ref-type="bibr">Thurman et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC62" ref-type="bibr">Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al. 2015</xref>). The ENCODE Project Consortium recently reanalyzed a subset of those data to provide highly curated DNase-seq data sets, together with RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data sets, for a DREAM Challenge to predict in vivo TF binding sites (TFBSs) (<uri xlink:href="http://dreamchallenges.org/project/encode-dream-in-vivo-transcription-factor-binding-site-prediction-challenge/">http://dreamchallenges.org/project/encode-dream-in-vivo-transcription-factor-binding-site-prediction-challenge/</uri>).</p>
  <p>To identify TFBSs, DNase-seq data are often mined for digital footprints (DFPs), which are short (∼10 bp) sharp decreases of accessibility within open chromatin regions, suggesting the presence of bound proteins (i.e., TFs) that locally protect the DNA from DNase I cleavage (<xref rid="GR260877MARC29" ref-type="bibr">Hesselberth et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC55" ref-type="bibr">Pique-Regi et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC42" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 2019</xref>). Although DFP analysis can indicate TFBSs (<xref rid="GR260877MARC54" ref-type="bibr">Neph et al. 2012b</xref>), several experimental and computational limitations impair its widespread use, including the need for greater sequencing depth compared with standard chromatin accessibility detection (<xref rid="GR260877MARC76" ref-type="bibr">Tsompana and Buck 2014</xref>). Experimentally, footprint detection is biased by the intrinsic sequence preference of DNase I, which can be adjusted computationally (<xref rid="GR260877MARC26" ref-type="bibr">He et al. 2014</xref>). Another bias originates from TFs with short residence time on DNA (<xref rid="GR260877MARC3" ref-type="bibr">Boyle et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC55" ref-type="bibr">Pique-Regi et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC4" ref-type="bibr">Buenrostro et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC52" ref-type="bibr">Nakahashi et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC26" ref-type="bibr">He et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC64" ref-type="bibr">Sherwood et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC70" ref-type="bibr">Sung et al. 2014</xref>), which can hinder footprint detection and cannot be corrected in silico. Computationally, DFP calling is challenging, time-consuming (e.g., requires between 31 and &gt;7000 h of CPU time for a single human genome), and algorithm dependent (<xref rid="GR260877MARC22" ref-type="bibr">Gusmao et al. 2016</xref>), thus welcoming alternative methods to identify the most relevant TF motifs in a particular cell type or to prioritize which TF motifs to use for a DFP search. Moreover, the binding sites identified by a DFP analysis do not inform directly on whether the underlying motifs are associated with lineage-specific TFs versus general “housekeeping” TFs (e.g., SP1, CTCF, ZNF143) (<xref rid="GR260877MARC13" ref-type="bibr">Eisenberg and Levanon 2013</xref>) or on whether the identified motifs are significantly enriched in the regulatory elements of that cell type. Furthermore, to our knowledge, there is no comprehensive DFP database to aid in the analysis of motif enrichment across cell types.</p>
  <p>In the main DNase-seq protocol adopted by ENCODE (<xref rid="GR260877MARC33" ref-type="bibr">John et al. 2013</xref>), the nuclear DNA is digested mildly and purified to select fragments &lt;500 bp for sequencing. The resulting sequencing reads can be used to call narrow peaks of ∼150 bp, which potentially come from mononucleosomes displaced by TF binding (<xref rid="GR260877MARC54" ref-type="bibr">Neph et al. 2012b</xref>). Therefore, these peaks closely resemble TF ChIP-seq peaks, which are often used to test for the presence of lineage specifiers through the enrichment of their TF binding motifs (<xref rid="GR260877MARC81" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC46" ref-type="bibr">Mariani et al. 2017</xref>). The analysis of DNase-seq peaks for enriched motifs, which is easier and quicker than DFP calling, has rarely been performed separately from TF ChIP-seq peaks (<xref rid="GR260877MARC25" ref-type="bibr">He et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC68" ref-type="bibr">Stergachis et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC19" ref-type="bibr">Goode et al. 2016</xref>). Those studies, which focused on a few, well-characterized mammalian lineages and compared chromatin accessibility profiles obtained upon cellular differentiation or activation processes, showed that dynamically accessible regions can be used to identify the binding motifs of lineage-specific TFs. Similarly, clustering ATAC-seq peaks obtained from a large variety of cancer cells followed by motif enrichment analysis within each cluster revealed motifs associated with up-regulated TFs (<xref rid="GR260877MARC8" ref-type="bibr">Corces et al. 2018</xref>). However, such analyses are computationally demanding, may vary depending on the choice of clustering algorithm, and may not be feasible in uncharacterized cell types for which closely related cellular states are not available to distinguish cell-type-specific motif enrichment. Therefore, novel statistical methods are needed for the analysis of chromatin accessibility data to distinguish the motifs of lineage specifiers.</p>
  <p>Despite the role of TF binding within accessible regulatory elements, many other processes can influence chromatin accessibility beyond cell-type-specific gene regulation (e.g., chromatin architecture, housekeeping processes, cell cycle), and very few bioinformatic tools have directly addressed the task of optimizing TF binding motif enrichment analysis of the accessible genome. MEME (<xref rid="GR260877MARC48" ref-type="bibr">McLeay and Bailey 2010</xref>) and HOMER (<xref rid="GR260877MARC28" ref-type="bibr">Heinz et al. 2010</xref>), two popular bioinformatic suites for the analysis and discovery of motifs, allow users to find enriched TF motifs in genomic data sets through a comparison with background sequences, either provided by the tool or by the users. When provided by the tool, the background sequences are not specific to the accessible genome, which may introduce compositional biases in the motif enrichment analysis. When provided by the users, it remains unclear what features should characterize an unbiased background, potentially leading to discrepant results. An alternative to MEME and HOMER is SeqUnwinder (<xref rid="GR260877MARC35" ref-type="bibr">Kakumanu et al. 2017</xref>), which can be used to leverage differences in chromatin accessibility profiles between cell types to improve the detection of enriched motifs associated with lineage specifiers. For the sake of flexibility, SeqUnwinder requires users to provide peak annotation as part of the input data, which here would require labeling the peaks that are differentially accessible in each cell type; how such labeling is performed could bias the inference of the enriched motifs. SeqUnwinder also performs a regularization step that requires parameter optimization and adds stochasticity to the results. The recently developed coTRaCTE tool (<xref rid="GR260877MARC77" ref-type="bibr">van Bömmel et al. 2018</xref>) infers cooperative TF pairs that co-occur in a cell-type-specific manner within accessible chromatin regions. coTRaCTE takes user-provided chromatin accessibility peak sets from many cell types, defines both the most cell-type-specific peaks and the most ubiquitous peaks, and performs a motif enrichment analysis between them. Despite directly sorting cell-type-specific peaks, coTRaCTE's analysis of each data set depends on the user-provided accompanying data sets, which may impair robustness and reproducibility of the results. To our knowledge, these computational tools have not been used extensively to allow evaluation of their accuracy in inferring motifs associated with lineage-specifying factors from genomic accessibility profiles.</p>
  <p>Here, we present motif enrichment in differential elements of accessibility (MEDEA) as a novel method to analyze genome-wide chromatin accessibility data for TF binding by evaluating the enrichment of their motifs within the accessible regions. MEDEA combines (1) filtering for cell-type-specific accessibility peaks using a curated, high-quality reference ensemble of accessibility peaks (e.g., ENCODE-DREAM); (2) calculation of TF motif enrichment against genomic background regions with similar compositional features; and (3) statistical analysis of the typical enrichment levels of each motif to help the evaluation of users’ results. We benchmarked MEDEA on data obtained by using a variety of assays (i.e., DNase-seq, ATAC-seq, scATAC-seq, and FAIRE-seq) for the main ENCODE cell lines. We then compared MEDEA to bioinformatic tools that have similar goals, as well as to transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles. To reveal novel regulatory interactions, we also applied MEDEA to 610 ENCODE DNase-seq data sets spanning a wide variety of human cell types.</p>

      <title>Standard motif enrichment analysis of DNase-seq peaks does not yield enrichment of the motifs of several known lineage specifiers</title>
      <p>We selected a panel of 12 human cell lines from ENCODE (<xref rid="GR260877MARC74" ref-type="bibr">Thurman et al. 2012</xref>) as a benchmark data set, comprising between 60,036 (H1-hES) and 291,130 (iPS) DNase-seq peaks representing accessible regions in each cell line, for identification of the binding motifs of lineage specifiers (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Table S1.1</ext-link>). In those DNase-seq peaks, we quantified TF motif enrichment by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve statistic, which is a well-established metric in these types of analysis (<xref rid="GR260877MARC21" ref-type="bibr">Gordan et al. 2009</xref>) and which we used to assess the presence of a TF motif among the 500 peaks with the highest signal (<italic>input set</italic>) compared with a <italic>background set</italic> of sequences (Methods) (<xref rid="GR260877MARC83" ref-type="bibr">Weirauch et al. 2013</xref>). For the AUROC implementation, we used two tools that we recently described for the analysis of TF ChIP-seq data: a TF-8mer glossary, representing the binding specificities of 671 metazoan TFs across all possible 8-bp sequences (8-mers), and GENRE for the construction of genomic background sets that are well matched for the sequence features of the input set (<xref rid="GR260877MARC46" ref-type="bibr">Mariani et al. 2017</xref>). In our benchmarking analysis of these DNase-seq peaks, we used 13 glossary modules that describe the specificities of TF families known to contain relevant developmental TFs for the selected cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF1">Fig. 1</xref>A).</p>

However, several motifs associated with known lineage specifiers, such as GATA in K562 cells (<xref rid="GR260877MARC7" ref-type="bibr">Cantor and Orkin 2002</xref>), IRF in GM12878 (<xref rid="GR260877MARC73" ref-type="bibr">Taniguchi et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC44" ref-type="bibr">Lu 2008</xref>), and POU in H1-hES cells (<xref rid="GR260877MARC86" ref-type="bibr">Young 2011</xref>), were not enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF1">Fig. 1</xref>A, black boxes; <xref rid="GR260877MARC46" ref-type="bibr">Mariani et al. 2017</xref>). Moreover, we noticed systematic enrichment of certain motifs (KLF, ETS); such enrichment could originate from multiple sources, such as experimental artifacts in the chromatin accessibility assay, computational biases in the prediction of motifs, or the constitutive binding of genomic target sites by sequence-specific housekeeping TFs (e.g., KLF3/9, SP1, and CTCF for the KLF motif) (<xref rid="GR260877MARC13" ref-type="bibr">Eisenberg and Levanon 2013</xref>). These results were robust to increasing numbers of DNase-seq peaks analyzed and to the use of PWMs instead of <italic>k</italic>-mer motif models (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S1A,B</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Table S1.4</ext-link>).</p>
      <p>As further evaluation, we inspected RNA-seq transcriptomic profiles provided by ENCODE-DREAM.

      <p>To elucidate the origin of such discrepancies, we inspected the distribution of accessibility peaks and other genomic profiles in five representative loci that control genes known to be regulated in a cell-type-specific manner (<italic>HBB</italic>, <italic>IL6</italic>, <italic>ALB</italic>, <italic>IGF2</italic>, <italic>NANOG</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF1">Fig. 1</xref>C; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S3</ext-link>). In the hemoglobin subunit beta (<italic>HBB</italic>) cluster locus, three chromatin accessibility peaks were shared across many different cell types, despite the fact that H3K4me1 and H3K27ac ChIP-seq peaks, RNA-seq transcripts, and 24 DNase-seq peaks were specific to K562 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF1">Fig. 1</xref>C). We observed similar trends at the other loci, with constitutively accessible peaks always overlapping the ChIP-seq peaks of a variety of ubiquitous housekeeping chromatin factors (<xref rid="GR260877MARC13" ref-type="bibr">Eisenberg and Levanon 2013</xref>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC27" ref-type="bibr">Heidari et al. 2014</xref>), such as CTCF, ZNF143, TAF1, SIN3A, and SP1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S3</ext-link>).

      <title>MEDEA enhances the enrichment of TF binding motifs associated with lineage specifiers</title>
      <p>We hypothesized that constitutively accessible regions can hinder the identification of enriched TF binding motifs of lineage specifiers. To avoid such bias, we developed a computational suite to detect TF motif enrichment in differential elements of accessibility (MEDEA), described below.</p>
      <p>The first task of the suite, MEDEA filtering, categorizes the accessibility peaks specific to an input cell type by performing pairwise comparisons between the open regions of the input cell type and each cell type within a reference panel (Methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF2">Fig. 2</xref>A). As the default reference panel for filtering, we equipped MEDEA with 12 highly curated DNase-seq data sets from ENCODE-DREAM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Table S1.1</ext-link>), which encompass a wide range of lineages and allow the creation of a series of accessible peak subsets (“MEDEA peaks”) for any cell type of interest (e.g., subset 1: peaks in the input cell type but not in A549; subset 2: peaks in the input cell type but not in GM12878, etc.) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S4</ext-link>). For each MEDEA peak series, we found that the top 500 peaks of the median MEDEA peak subset were still within the top 12% of peaks overall (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Table S2</ext-link>).</p>

Across the panel of selected cell types and motifs, the AUROC values were largely homogeneous within each series (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S4</ext-link>, right insets), suggesting the stability of the method. The use of the median AUROC (“MEDEA AUROC”) ensures robustness against outliers, which could appear when the input cell type is similar to a reference cell line. In the case of the pluripotent cell types H1-hES and iPS, their differential peaks relative to each other show no enrichment for motifs of pluripotency factors (e.g., POU), but enrichment of pluripotency motifs is identified nevertheless by the MEDEA AUROC because of the comparisons to other unrelated cell types in the reference panel (e.g., HepG2) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S4</ext-link>).</p>
      <p>The MEDEA AUROC values often highlighted different motifs than those enriched without MEDEA filtering (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF1">Fig. 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF2">Fig. 2</xref>B). In agreement with the high expression of <italic>IRF4/8</italic> in GM12878 and <italic>GATA1/2</italic> in K562 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF1">Fig. 1</xref>B), MEDEA revealed enrichment of the IRF and GATA motifs in DNase-seq data from those cell lines, respectively, as quantified by AUROC values significantly higher than the “nonenrichment” value of 0.5, which had been seen before filtering (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF1">Fig. 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF2">Fig. 2</xref>B). Similarly, POU and other motifs (e.g., SOX, ZIC, TEA) associated to pluripotency and embryonic TFs (e.g., POU5F1/SOX2 [<xref rid="GR260877MARC86" ref-type="bibr">Young 2011</xref>], ZIC2/3 [<xref rid="GR260877MARC45" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al. 2015</xref>], and TEAD3/4 [<xref rid="GR260877MARC85" ref-type="bibr">Yagi et al. 2007</xref>]; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S2</ext-link>) marked H1-hES and iPS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF2">Fig. 2</xref>B). In contrast to the enrichment patterns obtained without filtering, MEDEA did not systematically enrich for the KLF or ETS motifs across cell lines (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF1">Fig. 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF2">Fig. 2</xref>B). Furthermore, the MEDEA AUROC values were robust to the number of input peaks and TF motif model (i.e., <italic>k</italic>-mer models vs. PWMs) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S1C,D</ext-link>).</p>
      <p>To benchmark the performance of MEDEA against prior motif enrichment analysis tools, we compared the motif enrichment results obtained from applying various alternative tools to our benchmarking panel of DNase-seq data for 12 ENCODE cell lines and of 13 TF motifs. First, we tested AME from the MEME suite (<xref rid="GR260877MARC48" ref-type="bibr">McLeay and Bailey 2010</xref>) and findMotifsGenome.pl from the HOMER suite (<xref rid="GR260877MARC28" ref-type="bibr">Heinz et al. 2010</xref>), both of which quantify whether a particular motif set is enriched within a set of input sequences. When we used these tools’ default backgrounds (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S5A,B</ext-link>), we obtained two markedly distinct motif enrichment patterns, with limited motif enrichment of the expected lineage specifiers. We then asked whether using the ENCODE-DREAM data sets as the user-defined background sequences, and not as the comparative sequences for MEDEA filtering, could improve the detection of enriched motifs. To test this possibility, we used such data sets as background sequences both with the AUROC implementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF2">Fig. 2</xref>C; cf. with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF1">Fig. 1</xref>A) and with AME (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S5C</ext-link>; cf. with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S5A</ext-link>); in neither case did this improve the enrichment of the expected motifs. Finally, analysis of this reference panel using the recently proposed tool coTRaCTE (<xref rid="GR260877MARC77" ref-type="bibr">van Bömmel et al. 2018</xref>) resulted in constitutive enrichment of several lineage-specifying motifs (FOX, GATA, POU, SOX, TEA) across cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF2">Fig. 2</xref>D), which we interpreted as an artifact of comparing cell-type-specific peaks to ubiquitous peaks as opposed to peaks specific to another cell type.</p>
      <p>To quantitatively compare the motif enrichment results obtained by these different methods, we again turned to RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF1">Fig. 1</xref>B). Briefly, we correlated the up-regulation of TF families with the enrichment of their corresponding motifs in the various input sets, backgrounds, and software programs used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF2">Fig. 2</xref>E; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S6</ext-link>). By using these correlation values as our metric, MEDEA outperformed all the other methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF2">Fig. 2</xref>F), thus confirming the overall improvement of motif enrichment obtained after an accurate filtering of accessibility peaks for cell-type specificity. We further validated that these correlation values were robust to the number of input peaks. Although the RNA-seq correlation for the unfiltered DNase-seq peaks slightly improved upon inclusion of more peaks, MEDEA is already correlated better with the top 500 peaks (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S7</ext-link>).</p>

      <title>MEDEA selects for active regulatory regions and correlates with the recruitment of lineage specifiers</title>
      <p>The recruitment of lineage-specific TFs in regulatory regions is often associated with the displacement of occluding nucleosomes and the deposition of active histone marks in the surrounding nucleosomes (<xref rid="GR260877MARC18" ref-type="bibr">Ghisletti et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC28" ref-type="bibr">Heinz et al. 2010</xref>). Therefore, we examined the colocalization of accessibility peaks with ChIP-seq peaks for both histone marks H3K4me1, which has been associated with enhancers, and H3K27ac, which marks active enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF3">Fig. 3</xref>A, top), as well as the coactivator EP300 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S8</ext-link>), which is also a mark of active enhancers (<xref rid="GR260877MARC6" ref-type="bibr">Calo and Wysocka 2013</xref>). These ChIP-seq peaks showed significantly higher overlap with the MEDEA-filtered DNase-seq peaks than with the unfiltered DNase-seq peaks. Concomitantly, we noticed that MEDEA-filtered peaks were depleted of CTCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF3">Fig. 3</xref>A, bottom) and other housekeeping chromatin binders (e.g., ZNF143, SIN3A, SP1, POLR2A, TAF1) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S8</ext-link>). Altogether, these results indicate that MEDEA improves the detection of lineage-specific regulatory motifs by filtering for accessible regions that are associated to cell-type-specific active enhancers and dismissing peaks associated to common chromatin binders.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>To further corroborate that MEDEA-filtered peaks are enriched for regulatory regions recognized by cell-type-specific TFs, we inspected TF footprint data (DFPs). Briefly, for three of our benchmark cell lines (GM12878, K562, and H1-hES), we first identified a high-confidence set of DFPs that contained TF motifs supported by ChIP-seq data for the corresponding TFs (<xref rid="GR260877MARC42" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 2019</xref>). Next, we evaluated these high-confidence DFPs for colocalization with both the MEDEA-filtered peaks and the unfiltered DNase-seq peaks, and we determined their fold-change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF3">Fig. 3</xref>B). The TFs whose DFPs were more colocalized with MEDEA-filtered peaks were often associated to known lineage specifiers, such as POU5F1 in H1-hES, IRF4 and SPI1 in GM12878 (<xref rid="GR260877MARC81" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2012</xref>), and GATA1 and TAL1 in K562 (<xref rid="GR260877MARC79" ref-type="bibr">Wadman et al. 1997</xref>). These results, which are in strong agreement with the enriched motifs detected by MEDEA AUROC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF2">Fig. 2</xref>B), further indicate that MEDEA filtering selects accessible regions that regulate cell identity. This analysis also suggested a previously unappreciated pivotal role for TCF12 in embryonic stem cells, MEF2A and JUND in GM12878 B cells, and NR2F2 and JUND in K562 erythroleukemia cells. We evaluated these predictions by checking for the enrichment of these candidate motifs in their associated TF ChIP-seq peaks in factorbook (<xref rid="GR260877MARC81" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2012</xref>). Analysis of ChIP-seq data for those TFs (TCF12, MEF2A, NR2F2, and JUND) showed significant enrichment and centering within the ChIP-seq peaks for their cognate motifs and for the motifs of lineage specifiers (POU5F1, GATA1, TAL1, IRF4, SPI1) in those cell lines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S9</ext-link>), suggesting that the ChIPed TFs bind directly to DNA with cobinding of these lineage specifiers. Altogether, these results support the claim that MEDEA analysis of chromatin accessibility data can highlight lineage specifier motifs.</p>

      <p>To show the potential of MEDEA to reveal novel biological features, we applied MEDEA to more cell types represented in ENCODE. At first, we focused on the transition from ESCs through hematopoietic progenitors (HPs) to a variety of well-characterized committed lineages (B, Th1, Th2, and NK cells) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S10A</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Table S1.3</ext-link>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC68" ref-type="bibr">Stergachis et al. 2013</xref>). We applied MEDEA with its default settings (i.e., filtering against a panel of 12 reference ENCODE-DREAM data sets and using median AUROC for scoring) to evaluate the enrichment of motifs for several well-characterized regulators of these cell types (e.g., EBF1, RUNX, NFIL3) (<xref rid="GR260877MARC88" ref-type="bibr">Zhu and Paul 2008</xref>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC36" ref-type="bibr">Kamizono et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC58" ref-type="bibr">Ramírez et al. 2010</xref>). Similar to our previous results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF2">Fig. 2</xref>B), MEDEA prevented the constitutive enrichment of certain motifs (e.g., KLF, ETS, NANOG) and revealed enriched motif signatures specific to each cell type, associated to the expected regulators (e.g., TCF3 and SPI1 in B cells [<xref rid="GR260877MARC58" ref-type="bibr">Ramírez et al. 2010</xref>] and NFIL3 in NK cells [<xref rid="GR260877MARC36" ref-type="bibr">Kamizono et al. 2009</xref>]) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S10B,C</ext-link>).</p>

Because we observed large variability of the MEDEA AUROC values across these 126,270 combinations, we used the AUROC values obtained in the same DNase-seq data sets without MEDEA filtering as reference for the nonspecific motif enrichment variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF4">Fig. 4</xref>A, <italic>x</italic>-axis in left panel; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Table S3.1</ext-link>). We investigated the potential sources of this large variability to check for potential biases in the motif enrichment analysis. Here, we reasoned that AUROC values can be modulated both by genuine motif enrichment and by biases associated to particular motifs or cell types, such as the systematic enrichment we reported for KLF and ETS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF1">Fig. 1</xref>A). We tested for both types of bias by using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) of the AUROC distribution, which grouped the AUROC values by cell type or motif and tested whether the variability between groups was larger than the variability within groups. Although both tests were significant (F-statistic <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), this analysis revealed that biases owing to motifs were much stronger than biases owing to cell types (F<sub>Motifs</sub> = 640 vs. F<sub>Cell Types</sub> = 4.2; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Methods</ext-link>). Therefore, to control for motif-associated biases, we stratified the AUROC values by motifs, which resulted in far less dispersed distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF4">Fig. 4</xref>, cf. B and D), thus allowing for better discrimination of those DNase-seq data sets that are enriched for a particular motif.</p>

      <p>The third and final task of the MEDEA suite, MEDEA thresholding, leverages the fact that the motif-stratified AUROC distributions are typically characterized by a small pool of high MEDEA AUROC values (“high pool”) that lie above the bulk of the AUROC values (“low pool”) and are most likely to contain the cell types whose DNase-seq data are enriched for the particular motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF4">Fig. 4</xref>B; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S11</ext-link>). To distinguish between these two pools, we determined motif-specific thresholds (“MEDEA thresholds”; Methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF4">Fig. 4</xref>B, green lines; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Figs. S11, S12B</ext-link>), which have an average value of 0.55 (±0.03) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF4">Fig. 4</xref>C; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Table S3.2</ext-link>). Certain motifs can show a significant enrichment value even if their MEDEA AUROC is close to 0.5 (typically considered to indicate lack of enrichment).</p>
      <p>We reasoned that the incorporation of these thresholds in MEDEA could help in evaluating whether the enrichment of a motif is significant, and thus could potentially reveal biologically relevant <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory motifs that might be missed by standard analyses. To explore this possibility, we first checked whether the cell types within each motif's high pools were similar to each other, which was often the case. The RFX high pool mostly contained cell types from the neuronal lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF4">Fig. 4</xref>B, left), confirming previous findings on the essential role of RFX in sensory neuron differentiation (<xref rid="GR260877MARC71" ref-type="bibr">Swoboda et al. 2000</xref>). Despite the fact that the NF-kB and NFAT motifs are associated to two related families of Rel Homology Domain (RHD) TFs mostly known for their roles in B- and T-cell activation (<xref rid="GR260877MARC50" ref-type="bibr">Müller and Rao 2010</xref>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC65" ref-type="bibr">Siggers et al. 2012</xref>), the NF-kB high pool contained just lymphoid cells, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF4">Fig. 4</xref>B, center), whereas the NFAT high pool contained mostly muscle and a few endothelial cell types, in agreement with prior studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF4">Fig. 4</xref>B, right; <xref rid="GR260877MARC30" ref-type="bibr">Horsley and Pavlath 2002</xref>). Similarly, many other high pools were enriched for specific lineages (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S11</ext-link>), both confirming well-characterized regulatory functions (e.g., EBF1 in B cells [<xref rid="GR260877MARC2" ref-type="bibr">Boller et al. 2016</xref>], MEF2 TFs in the heart [<xref rid="GR260877MARC43" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al. 1997</xref>], HNF1 and HNF4 in kidney and intestinal tissues [<xref rid="GR260877MARC63" ref-type="bibr">Ryffel 2001</xref>], LIM TFs in the eye [<xref rid="GR260877MARC56" ref-type="bibr">Porter et al. 1997</xref>], TCF7 in immune cells [<xref rid="GR260877MARC84" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al. 2012</xref>], and TAL bHLH TFs such as ATONAL, NEURO TFs and OLIG TFs in the brain [<xref rid="GR260877MARC32" ref-type="bibr">Imayoshi and Kageyama 2014</xref>]) and supporting less-characterized ones (e.g., EBF1 in in vitro differentiated bipolar neurons [<xref rid="GR260877MARC17" ref-type="bibr">Garel et al. 1999</xref>], LIM TFs in neuroblastoma [<xref rid="GR260877MARC12" ref-type="bibr">Durbin et al. 2018</xref>], and KLF in gastrointestinal tissues [<xref rid="GR260877MARC37" ref-type="bibr">Katz et al. 2002</xref>]). Altogether, these examples show that the use of motif-specific MEDEA thresholds aids in identifying lineage specifiers.</p>
      <p>We also checked for enrichment biases owing to motif similarities. In the case of KLF, its core consensus sequence is contained within the CTCF motif (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S12A</ext-link>); therefore, the constitutive enrichment of the KLF motif observed in unfiltered peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF1">Fig. 1</xref>A) could come from constitutive open regions encompassing CTCF TFBSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF1">Fig. 1</xref>C). When we compared KLF and CTCF AUROC values across the 610 ENCODE data sets, we indeed noticed that the CTCF motif had a far less pronounced enrichment compared with the KLF motif (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S12B</ext-link>), despite a strong correlation both before and upon MEDEA filtering (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S12C</ext-link>). MEDEA decreases KLF motif enrichment substantially (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S12C</ext-link>, dashed line), likely because of the removal of CTCF TFBSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF3">Fig. 3</xref>A, bottom). Overall, these observations agree with our hypothesis that KLF motif enrichment is in part contaminated by overlapping CTCF motifs, but such bias is mitigated by MEDEA filtering.</p>
      <p>The vast majority of the high pool enriched motifs would not have been discovered without MEDEA filtering of the DNase-seq peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF4">Fig. 4</xref>B, <italic>x</italic>-axis). At an AUROC threshold of 0.6 across all motifs, the use of unfiltered DNase-seq peaks would have (1) missed 6352 (∼87%) of the high pool cases from being identified as enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF4">Fig. 4</xref>A, center), and (2) misidentified 3445 (∼3%) of the low pool cases as enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF4">Fig. 4</xref>A, right). Thus, accurate prefiltering of cell-type-specific accessible regions profoundly changed the identification of enriched motifs, which mostly agreed with prior reports on the regulatory roles of the corresponding TFs.</p>

      <title>Clustering of motif enrichment data from MEDEA reveals novel regulatory principles underlying lineage specification</title>
      <p>To explore how MEDEA will impact the inference of motif enrichment for single data sets submitted by users, we rearranged all the AUROC low and high pools according to cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF4">Fig. 4</xref>D; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S13</ext-link>). To evaluate the accuracy of the enriched motifs, we selected nine matched pairs of similar cell types (e.g., “right lung” vs. “left lung” cells; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Methods</ext-link>) that we expected to share similar motif enrichment patterns. We found that the correlation between matched samples was much greater than that between dissimilar cell types (<italic>P</italic>-value &lt;&lt; 0.01, Wilcoxon test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF4">Fig. 4</xref>E), thus confirming that MEDEA captures biologically relevant features of transcriptional regulatory programs. Inspection of the motif enrichment results confirms the accuracy of the MEDEA results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF4">Fig. 4</xref>D; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S13</ext-link>). As examples, in spinal cord cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF4">Fig. 4</xref>D, left), MEDEA identified motifs that correspond to TFs known to play roles in neuronal differentiation (e.g., NFIX [<xref rid="GR260877MARC11" ref-type="bibr">Deneen et al. 2006</xref>], OLIG [<xref rid="GR260877MARC72" ref-type="bibr">Takebayashi et al. 2002</xref>], YY1 [<xref rid="GR260877MARC24" ref-type="bibr">He et al. 2007</xref>]), whereas SOX (<xref rid="GR260877MARC69" ref-type="bibr">Stolt et al. 2002</xref>) was the only motif shared with neuronal stem progenitor and pluripotent cells (e.g., NT2 D1) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S13</ext-link>). As another example, MEDEA not only identified the expected RUNX/ETS motifs in T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF4">Fig. 4</xref>D, center) but also revealed the relevant TCF7/NF-kB motifs despite their low MEDEA AUROC values, highlighting the power of MEDEA thresholding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF4">Fig. 4</xref>C). In forelimb muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF4">Fig. 4</xref>D, right), MEDEA highlighted both the known regulator NFIX (<xref rid="GR260877MARC49" ref-type="bibr">Messina et al. 2010</xref>) and also the NFAT, MYF, ZBTB18, and TAL/E2A/TCF3 motifs, whose roles in this cell type are less characterized but are partially shared with related tissues (e.g., “tongue” in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S13</ext-link>). In yet more cell types, MEDEA uncovered enriched motifs that confirmed well-characterized regulatory interactions (e.g., GATA/MEF2 TFs in cardiac tissues, LHX and other homeodomain factors in retinal development, GATA TFs in adrenal tissues), reinforced less characterized ones (e.g., estrogen receptor and Jun factors in adrenal tissues), and distinguished motifs between cell types from the same lineage (e.g., islet precursor and body of pancreas cells within the pancreatic lineage) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S13</ext-link>).</p>
      <p>To investigate how motif enrichment patterns reflect regulatory programs, we clustered the MEDEA AUROC values of the high pools by TF motifs and by cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF5">Fig. 5</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S14</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Table S3.3</ext-link>). Cell types largely clustered according to their lineage class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF5">Fig. 5</xref>, colored bars at the top), supporting the claim that the MEDEA AUROC values capture genuine features of cell fate specification. For example, the enriched motifs found in DNase-seq data from placenta and trophoblast cells clustered together tightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF5">Fig. 5</xref>). The GCM1 and AP2 motifs were enriched very specifically in this small cluster, in agreement with previous observations that GCM1 is involved in placental growth factor expression in human trophoblast-derived cells (<xref rid="GR260877MARC41" ref-type="bibr">Li and Roberson 2017</xref>) and TCFAP2C establishes the extraembryonic trophoblast maintenance program in murine embryos (<xref rid="GR260877MARC39" ref-type="bibr">Kuckenberg et al. 2010</xref>). The GRHL1 motif also shows enrichment in these two tissues, and its paralog GRHL2 (which recognizes a similar motif) is specifically expressed in the placenta, where it controls trophoblast branching morphogenesis in mice (<xref rid="GR260877MARC80" ref-type="bibr">Walentin et al. 2015</xref>).</p>

Motifs for FLI1 and other ETS domain TFs were strongly enriched throughout the supercluster, as expected because FLI1 is a known regulator of both hematopoiesis and angiogenesis in humans and other vertebrates (<xref rid="GR260877MARC66" ref-type="bibr">Smeets et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC75" ref-type="bibr">Toyama et al. 2017</xref>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC82" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2018</xref>).

      <p>We observed a cluster containing most of the kidney-derived samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF5">Fig. 5</xref>), which showed enrichment for several very similar HOX motifs (e.g., HOXD9, CDX2), consistent with the known roles of these factors in kidney development. <italic>Hoxd9/Hoxd10</italic> knockout mice show a severe reduction in kidney size (<xref rid="GR260877MARC10" ref-type="bibr">de la Cruz et al. 1999</xref>), and a CDX2-Cre construct drives expression in kidney (<xref rid="GR260877MARC60" ref-type="bibr">Reyes-Fernandez and Fleet 2016</xref>). This kidney cluster also showed enrichment of the motif for the metabolic regulator NRF1, which has been shown to be expressed at lower levels in clinical samples from chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients undergoing dialysis than in healthy controls (<xref rid="GR260877MARC87" ref-type="bibr">Zaza et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="GR260877MARC23" ref-type="bibr">Hashad et al. 2016</xref>). This observation was previously interpreted as evidence of a homeostatic response to oxidative stress secondary to dialysis; however, our results suggest the alternative possibility that lower levels of NRF1 expression may predispose people to the development of CKD. Consistent with this hypothesis, a study combining CKD GWAS with analysis of eQTLs in healthy kidney samples found that kidney eQTLs are significantly enriched in NRF1 binding sites described by ENCODE (<xref rid="GR260877MARC38" ref-type="bibr">Ko et al. 2017</xref>).

For several of the ENCODE cell lines that we used to benchmark MEDEA, data sets obtained by ATAC-seq, scATAC-seq, or FAIRE-seq were publicly available. Motif enrichment analysis of those data sets without MEDEA filtering confirmed several results that we had obtained when analyzing the corresponding unfiltered DNase-seq peaks, such as a lack of strong enrichment for the POU motif in embryonic stem cells, the IRF motif in GM12878 cells, and the GATA motif in K562 cells (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF6">Fig. 6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF1">Fig. 1</xref>A).

      <p>Similar to our previous comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF2">Fig. 2</xref>E,F), we evaluated the AUROC motif enrichment of TFs by their correlation with the corresponding transcriptomic up-regulation from RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF6">Fig. 6</xref>C; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S15</ext-link>). For all assays, we observed that this correlation was higher with MEDEA peaks than with unfiltered peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF6">Fig. 6</xref>D, pink vs. purple bars), indicating that MEDEA improves motif enrichment analysis of accessibility data obtained from multiple different chromatin accessibility profiling technologies.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>MEDEA is a computational suite created to identify the motifs of lineage-specifying TFs that are enriched within the accessible chromatin regions in any cell type. To achieve this goal, MEDEA performs three main tasks: (1) filtering the accessible regions to identify relevant, cell-type-specific peaks; (2) assessing the filtered, accessible regions for enrichment of a large collection of human TF binding motifs; (3) imposing motif-specific thresholds on enrichment to identify lineage specifiers. To validate MEDEA, here we compared results from analysis of DNase-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF1">Figs. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF2">2</xref>) and ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF6">Fig. 6</xref>) data against RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF3">Fig. 3</xref>) and characterized lineage specifier motifs solely by their enrichment in chromatin accessibility profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF4">Figs. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF5">5</xref>).</p>
    <p>The need for motif enrichment tools specifically designed for analysis of chromatin accessibility data as opposed to TF ChIP-seq data is a problem that previously had not been addressed sufficiently. In TF ChIP-seq data, for a TF that binds DNA directly through its own DNA binding domain, its cognate motif is typically anticipated to be enriched and centered within the ChIP-seq peaks. In contrast, there is no expectation of motif centering within chromatin accessibility peaks, which merge the influence of nucleosome organization and the many TFs active in a given cell type. Although these aspects challenge the identification of the most relevant TF binding motifs in a given cell type, chromatin accessibility assays, in principle, allow a much broader exploration of potential <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory motifs within a cell type. Thus, because multiple lineage-specific TFs may be active in any one cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF4">Fig. 4</xref>D,E), it is not surprising that their corresponding motifs may show relatively low (0.55 on average) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF4">Fig. 4</xref>C) enrichment scores (MEDEA AUROC values) in a particular cell type's chromatin accessibility data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF4">Fig. 4</xref>D).</p>
    <p>Our finding that MEDEA filtering selects for regulatory regions without requiring any additional information on other epigenetic features (e.g., histone marks, TF binding) supports a recent study of murine tissue-specific enhancers (<xref rid="GR260877MARC15" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al. 2018</xref>) in which detection of active enhancers was improved by restricting to DNase-seq or H3K27ac ChIP-seq peaks that differed between phenotypically distant tissues. Although the incorporation of additional epigenomic information (e.g., ChIP-seq profiles of binding factors or histone marks) could potentially improve the power of MEDEA in identifying enriched motifs associated with regulatory elements, MEDEA requires only chromatin accessibility data; moreover in many research and clinical applications, it may be too costly or tissue samples may be too limiting to be able to generate additional epigenomic data sets (e.g., TF ChIP-seq).</p>
    <p>MEDEA outperformed other state-of-the-art tools, as evaluated by the correlation of motif enrichment in open chromatin with the up-regulation of the cognate TFs. Two features of MEDEA are likely major contributors to its improved performance. First, instead of constructing the background for the motif enrichment analysis from genomic regions open in other cell types (as in AME with user-supplied background) or from regions open across cell types (as in coTRaCTE), for any particular cell type, MEDEA identifies chromatin accessibility peaks specific to that cell type compared individually with a panel of reference cell types before any enrichment analysis is performed. Second, MEDEA performs motif enrichment analysis using compositionally matched genomic regions as background sequences. Incorporation of either or both of these approaches might improve the performance of other tools used for analysis of chromatin accessibility data.</p>
    <p>MEDEA is also the only available tool equipped with a highly curated reference chromatin accessibility data set; this reference panel is essential for its robustness, flexibility, and reproducibility, as well as for its integration with other tools such as SeqUnwinder. Because SeqUnwinder requires prelabeled open regions to determine cell-type-specific enriched motifs, MEDEA filtering can be used to generate such labels by categorizing open regions according to their specific presence in MEDEA reference sets. As SeqUnwinder identifies de novo motifs using MEME, it would be interesting to compare those motifs with the known motifs found enriched within the MEDEA collection. Overall, MEDEA offers a middle ground among the other methods: It takes user-defined peaks and defines cell-type-specific labels itself and independently from other data sets.</p>
    <p>MEDEA analyzes chromatin accessibility peaks to quickly provide a genome-wide characterization of overrepresented motifs, allowing users to infer the lineage-specifying TFs that may be particularly important for gene regulatory programs in a given cell type. MEDEA is an orthogonal approach to the identification of DFP, which requires higher read coverage compared with standard peak calling in order to identify specific sites of TF occupancy within chromatin accessibility data (<xref rid="GR260877MARC76" ref-type="bibr">Tsompana and Buck 2014</xref>). The bias observed in DFP calls against TFs with short residence times on DNA (<xref rid="GR260877MARC70" ref-type="bibr">Sung et al. 2014</xref>) does not apply to the data used by MEDEA, as long as the regions containing such a TF's binding sites remain accessible when the TF is transiently released. In contrast to DFP algorithms, which limit the analysis to single accessibility profiles (<xref rid="GR260877MARC22" ref-type="bibr">Gusmao et al. 2016</xref>) or to time series data across cellular differentiation (<xref rid="GR260877MARC64" ref-type="bibr">Sherwood et al. 2014</xref>), MEDEA is empowered by integrating data from a wide reference panel of cell types to identify genomic regions that are accessible in a cell-type-specific manner.</p>
    <p>By using highly curated chromatin accessibility data (e.g., DNase-seq data from ENCODE-DREAM), we showed that MEDEA can filter cell-type-specific peaks obtained from ATAC-seq, scATAC-seq, or FAIRE-seq. This ability to integrate information from different chromatin accessibility assays is crucial, as it obviates the need to generate additional assay-specific reference panel data sets for each new technology that may be developed in the future for profiling accessible regions of the genome. Indeed, MEDEA may serve as a useful computational validation tool to assess the quality of chromatin accessibility data resulting from novel assays.</p>

We omitted data sets from ENCODE that had red flags or multiple yellow flags indicating concerns about data quality. For DNase-seq and ATAC-seq data sets, we considered just 150-bp peaks that were present in both replicates according to a reciprocal overlap of 50% (command “intersectBed” in BEDTools) (<xref rid="GR260877MARC53" ref-type="bibr">Neph et al. 2012a</xref>). The overlapping peaks were merged, trimmed at 150 bp, and assigned an average signal intensity value. For scATAC-seq data sets, we considered single replicate count matrices of the top 50,000 peaks, we ranked the peaks by the percentage of associated cells, and we trimmed the peaks to 150 bp. FAIRE-seq data were already merged, so we only trimmed to 150 bp. For ChIP-seq data, we collected all the ENCODE data sets specific to the 12 benchmarking cell lines as narrowPeaks for a variety of constitutive chromatin binding factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF3">Fig. 3</xref>A, bottom; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.260877.120/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S8</ext-link>) and as broadPeaks for two histone marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR260877MARF3">Fig. 3</xref>A, top); they were used without further postprocessing.</p>

These DFPs were based on DNase-seq data, computed using HINT, and validated by the copresence of ChIP-seq peaks for the associated TFs. The true TF labels per footprint were provided by the Costa laboratory, and we used them without further postprocessing.</p>

    <p>This project was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant R21 HG009268 to M.L.B. K.W. was supported in part by the NIH Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics training grant T32 HG002295. We thank Anshul Kundaje (Stanford University), the ENCODE-DREAM Challenge Organizers, and the following ENCODE data production centers (Snyder laboratory, Myers laboratory, Stamatoyannopoulos laboratory) for the production of the ENCODE-DREAM DNase-seq data sets that we used as our reference sets as well as the RNA-seq data we used as part of our validation. We thank Sai Ma and Jason Buenrostro (Harvard University), who performed narrowPeak calling on previously published ATAC-seq data in GM12878 cells (<xref rid="GR260877MARC4" ref-type="bibr">Buenrostro et al. 2013</xref>) and provided counts matrices for previously published scATAC-seq data (<xref rid="GR260877MARC5" ref-type="bibr">Buenrostro et al. 2015</xref>). We thank Zhijian Li and Ivan Costa (RWTH University Hospital) for providing HINT DFP data with TF ChIP-seq support categorized by TF, especially for the extra TFs we asked for in addition to those previously published. We thank Alena van Bömmel and Martin Vingron (Max Planck Institute) for help with coTRaCTE. We thank the members of the Bulyk laboratory for discussions and suggestions. We share copyrights for the TF-8mer glossary and GENRE background construction software that is used by MEDEA for motif enrichment analysis.</p>
