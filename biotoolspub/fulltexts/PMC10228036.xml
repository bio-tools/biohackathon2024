        <p id="Par1">CRISPR/Cas is an efficient genome editing system that has been widely used for functional genetic studies and exhibits high potential in biomedical translational applications. Indel analysis has thus become one of the most common practices in the lab to evaluate DNA editing events generated by CRISPR/Cas. Several indel analysis tools have been reported, however, it is often required that users have certain bioinformatics training and basic command-line processing capability.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Results</title>
        <p id="Par2">Here, we developed CRISPR-GRANT, a stand-alone graphical CRISPR indel analysis tool, which could be easily installed for multi-platforms, including Linux, Windows, and macOS. CRISPR-GRANT offered a straightforward GUI by simple click-and-run for genome editing analysis of single or pooled amplicons and one-step analysis for whole-genome sequencing without the need of data pre-processing, making it ideal for novice lab scientists. Moreover, it also exhibited shorter run-time compared with tools currently available.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p id="Par3">Therefore, CRISPR-GRANT is a valuable addition to the current CRISPR toolkits that significantly lower the barrier for wet-lab researchers to conduct indel analysis from large NGS datasets. CRISPR-GRANT binaries are freely available for Linux (above Ubuntu 16.04), macOS (above High Sierra 10.13) and Windows (above Windows 7) at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/fuhuancheng/CRISPR-GRANT">https://github.com/fuhuancheng/CRISPR-GRANT</ext-link>.

    <p id="Par12">CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) is a genome-editing technology derived from type II bacterial adaptive immune system, among which CRISPR/Cas9 and CRISPR/Cpf1 are the most widely used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. When guided by a short gRNA transcript, CRISPR-Cas could be easily targeted to virtually any genomic loci and generate double-strand DNA breaks by recruiting cellular DNA repair machinery through either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR), generating DNA insertion or deletion mutations (indels) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Since its discovery, CRISPR has been widely used to understand basic biological processes and has been developed as a potential game-changer for therapeutic applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, the off-target effect is still one of the major concerns for CRISPR-mediated genome editing experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and quantitative analysis of targeted/off-target indels has thus become a standard practice in the lab. Especially with the application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and routine generation of large-scale datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], systematic analysis of genome edits has become highly dependent on efficient bioinformatics tools.</p>
    <p id="Par13">We reasoned that an ideal bioinformatic program for analyzing CRISPR-mediated genome editing would feature: (1) user-friendly design with graphic user interface (GUI) to guide potential users throughout the process; (2) easy installation in support of cross-platform usage; (3) all-in-one solution to enable both single and multiple amplicon analysis and detection of base-editor mediated single nucleotide changes; (4) locally deployed to avoid uploading of sensitive data or large NGS datasets; (5) highly efficient and could finish whole-genome analysis within a reasonable time frame. To systematically analyze genome edits, currently several tools have been developed, including CRISPResso/CRISPResso2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], Cas-analyzer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], CRISPR-DAV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], CRIS.py [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and a few others (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), which could accurately analyze certain kinds of genome editing events, but each has its limitations. They were categorized mainly into two types. One type was locally used, such as CRISPResso, CRIPSResso2 and CRISPR-DAV. These tools often came with command-line based usage, requiring the users had some bio-informatics experiences. Additionally, these command tools were often implemented for Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux, Unix or macOS, not compatible for Windows systems. The other type was web services, such as Cas-analyzer, which had web GUI for online use, convenient for common users. CRISPResso2 also provided web services for amplicon analysis. However, CRISPResso2 only made analysis for amplicon pools or whole-genome available in command-line utilities. Nevertheless, web services could not be used offline, not suitable for NGS data, which was very large, often at the size of megabytes (MB) or even gigabytes (GB). Furthermore, computers in many laboratory holding sensitive data, therefore, usually off the internet, could also not meet the requirement. This would make it difficult for common researchers to use NGS data for CRISPR indel analysis, for they either should have some expertise in bio-informatics or would bear to upload their data to web servers. In addition, among the tools, CRISPResso2, a successor of CRISPResso, was the only one still in heavy development and updating, others, on the contrary, either stopped maintaining or not available for download and use. However, CRISPResso2 was developed in Python2, which had been end of life at April 2020. Therefore, there would be difficulties for users to download and install CRISPResso2 ever since. Furthermore, the amplicon, pooled amplicons and whole-genome analysis command-line tools also had very different interface in CRISPResso2, which might not be friendly for common users. Particularly, most of these tools rely on command line-based usage to analyze target datasets and thus are very difficult for common users such as traditional experimental biologists in the lab. In summary, although several indel analysis tools have been developed, they either require users to have certain bio-informatics training and basic command-line processing capability or need an internet connection during analysis. Therefore, developing a CRISPR indel analysis tool with intuitive GUI, easy installation, and offline cross-platform support is highly desired.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>A list of indel analysis tools which were previously reported</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Tools</th><th align="left">Platform(s)</th><th align="left">Interface</th><th align="left">References</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">CRISPR-GA</td><td align="left">NA</td><td align="left">NA</td><td align="left">Guell et al.

      <title>Graphical user interface on multiple platforms</title>
      <p id="Par20">CRISPR-GRANT was written to provide a straightforward cross-platform GUI, where the users could complete indel analysis by simple point-and-click (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The GUI consists of two parts: one is for basic inputs where the FASTQ file(s), reference sequence file, and output folder could all be input by simple mouse-clicking. Default options are given through GUI and support custom changes by users. The other mode is for advanced users with additional options. For users who would like to set more parameters for the tools within the analysis pipeline, additional options would pass to those tools directly. A universal GUI was provided for single-end or paired-end sequencing data from amplicon, pooled amplicons, and allele-specific analysis, supporting analysis for genome editing events from Cas9/Cpf1 and base-editors. The overall procedure was the same for all the analyses. All the needed data could be given through the same GUI with similar operations and easy to learn and use. The only required inputs are: (1) FASTQ file(s); (2) reference sequence(s); (3) the output folder for analysis results. For single-end sequencing, the respective FASTQ file is required. As for paired-end sequencing results, two separate FASTQ files, one for each end, should be provided. The input reference sequence is needed in FASTA format. Depending on the intended analysis, one (amplicon), two (allele-specific, e.g.), or more (pooled amplicons) sequences could be put into a single reference file. The overall procedure is kept the same for all the different analyses, for common users to run the processing with minimum guidance.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>CRISPR-GRANT provides intuitive GUI for CRISPR indel analysis on multiple platforms.

      <p id="Par21">In addition, CRISPR-GRANT also provides command-line tools for more advanced users. All the tools in the pipeline are independent and could be used separately when the correct input data are given, which is developed in case of special requirements from end-users.</p>

      <title>Whole-genome sequencing analysis from raw data</title>
      <p id="Par23">Since genome-wide identification of CRISPR editing events (such as off-target effects) has become a common strategy for evaluating on-target and off-target efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], CRISPR-GRANT was also designed to support one-step analysis from raw WGS data, a unique feature compared with other available indel analysis tools. CRISPR might cause mutations beyond expectation among the whole genome. Pooled amplicon sequencing could evaluate mutations at some specific sites on the genome, such as prediction tools or other assays, while most of the genome remained no investigation. Though CRISPResso or CRISPResso2, for example, had provided utilities, CRISPRessoWGS, analyzing genome editing from WGS data, however, BAM file(s) aligned to genome reference still must be provided, which expected users to have bio-informatics background. Therefore, none of those CRISPR analysis tools currently, as far as we know, could analyze indel mutations of whole-genome for wet-lab researchers from raw WGS data. Using CRISPR-GRANT, the users only need to provide raw sequencing data (single-end or paired-end FASTQ files), reference genome sequence and a file containing regions of interest to analyze through point and click. This function was especially useful in investigating and quantifying CRISPR indel frequencies of potential target or off-target sites on the whole genome for biologists. This feature enables the user to systematically identify and evaluate DNA mutations caused by CRISPR/Cas system, supporting both regular Cas9/Cpf1 and base-editors. When comparing with one of the benchmark programs that have been widely used, CRISPResso2 for example, pre-processing of WGS data, such as alignment to the reference genome, is expected for CRISPResso2 before analysis, which would require the users to have some bioinformatics background and finish the procedure using command line when running the program. In CRISPR-GRANT, however, the end-users would only need to provide raw sequencing data (single-end or paired-end FASTQ files), the reference genome sequence, and a file containing regions of interests to analyze, through the simple point-and-click, which would be especially useful for lab scientists to analyze and quantify indel frequencies of potential off-target sites on the genome-scale.</p>

      <title>Performance comparison with representative benchmark tools.</title>
      <p id="Par24">To evaluate the performance of CRISPR-GRANT on data analysis, a cross-comparison of single amplicons analysis was performed with representative benchmark tools, CRISPResso2 and Cas-analyzer, using the same sample data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. When analyzing small or medium-size data, all the tools could finish the run within a reasonable time frame, while CRISPR-GRANT cost the least time to complete the analysis. When analyzing simulated data containing a large number of reads (1 M (million) reads), CRISPR-GRANT was the most efficient and only took about half an hour to complete the analysis. (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>CRISPR-GRANT is an efficient stand-alone program for large-scale indel data processing. <bold>A</bold> CRISPR-GRANT outperformed other representative tools currently available in processing different scales of data.

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p id="Par25">In this study, we developed a stand-alone indel analysis tool, CRISPR-GRANT, for the efficient evaluation of CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing. CRISPR-GRANT supports easy installation on multiple platforms, including macOS, Windows, and Linux, and provides a user-friendly GUI to guide the analysis process for common novice lab researchers. Moreover, the program offers one-step analysis for whole-genome sequencing data by simple click-and-run and exhibited more efficient data processing speed when compared with other available benchmark programs. Therefore, CRISPR-GRANT may serve as a valuable addition to the current toolkits for CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing analysis.</p>
    <p id="Par26">With the application of next-generation sequencing technology, especially the recent addition of single-cell sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and spatial profiling, the research broadness and data scale which traditional biology scientists handle in the lab have been vastly expanded. Therefore, it is now more important than ever for researchers to rely on efficient bioinformatics programs and pipelines to process and analyze NGS datasets. This is also the case for CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing, where the potential impact of off-target effects receives increasing attention, and evaluation of mutations on the genome-wide scale has become a common practice in the lab. Most of the programs currently available use the command-line and Linux-system-based approach to run the analysis, which usually requires the researchers to have certain bioinformatics training and thus is inconvenient for junior students and regular scientists. With this in mind, CRISPR-GRANT was designed to meet the need for large-scale data analysis for novice researchers. Especially for whole-genome sequencing data, CRISPR-GRANT offers one-step WGS analysis from raw data and run with clear GUI guidance, a unique feature compared with other tools. Other features of CRISPR-GRANT include easy installation on multiple systems, off-line use without the need of uploading sensitive data, and high running efficiency (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). Moreover, the program is also compatible with other genome editing technologies such as TALENs and ZFNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, CRISPR-GRANT is a user-friendly and GUI-enabled program that would be very helpful for lab researchers to analyze both on-target and off-target genome editing results.</p>
    <p id="Par27">Meanwhile, it is also worth noting that a few improvements for CRISPR-GRANT would warrant further exploration. One of such is to expand the analytical capabilities for WGS data. The current version of the program requires the end-users to provide specific target sites for alignment visualization, while ideally, it would be more exciting if the program could plot alignment genome-wide. Secondly, improvement is also warranted on the analysis accuracy by filtering the PCR artifacts from amplified single or pooled amplicons. As PCR is used for the amplification process, which would occasionally bring artificial mutations into the amplicon, a filtering process will help to remove the potential noise from indel analysis. Besides, the options for output figures could also be a useful addition to the current toolkit.</p>
    <p id="Par28">In summary, CRISPR-GRANT is a stand-alone and versatile tool that provides efficient indel analysis capability for both single, pooled amplicons and WGS datasets, supporting a variety of CRISPR/Cas systems as well as other genome editing technologies. With its user-friendly GUI feature, CRISPR-GRANT will be a valuable tool to meet the need of novice experimental biologists for analyzing small- or large-scale genome edits.</p>
