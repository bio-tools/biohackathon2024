      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Recent large-scale multi-omics studies resulted in quick accumulation of an overwhelming amount of cancer-related data, which provides an unprecedented resource to interrogate diverse questions. While certain existing web servers are valuable and widely used, analysis and visualization functions with regard to re-investigation of these data at cohort level are not adequately addressed. Here, we present CVCDAP, a web-based platform to deliver an interactive and customizable toolbox off the shelf for cohort-level analysis of TCGA and CPTAC public datasets, as well as user uploaded datasets. CVCDAP allows flexible selection of patients sharing common molecular and/or clinical characteristics across multiple studies as a virtual cohort, and provides dozens of built-in customizable tools for seamless genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and clinical analysis of a single virtual cohort, as well as, to compare two virtual cohorts with relevance. The flexibility and analytic competence of CVCDAP empower experimental and clinical researchers to identify new molecular mechanisms and develop potential therapeutic approaches, by building and analyzing virtual cohorts for their subject of interests. We demonstrate that CVCDAP can conveniently reproduce published findings and reveal novel insights by two applications. The CVCDAP web server is freely available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://omics.bjcancer.org/cvcdap/">https://omics.bjcancer.org/cvcdap/</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>A massive amount of cancer sequencing and molecular profiling data from recent international consortiums (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref>) creates unparalleled opportunities for data mining, which could significantly improve our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis and help develop new therapeutic approaches. Substantial efforts have also been made to make these data capable for pan-cancer analysis. For example, The Cancer Genomics Atlas (TCGA) generated a re-calling of uniform files by applying an ensemble of seven mutation-calling algorithms with scoring and artifact filtering (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) uniformed data processing and merged mutation calling results from three established pipelines in The PanCancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) project (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CTPAC) applied a Common Data Analysis Pipeline (CDAP) to reduce the variability introduced by disparate data analysis platforms and ensure uniformly formatted results with consistent identification thresholds (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, exploration and re-analysis of these high-quality data for a specific research question often entails intensive programming in data processing and calling statistical and analytical software tools needing heterogeneous running environments, which creates a huge obstacle for experimental and clinical researchers to investigate these data.</p>
    <p>The community has endeavored to facilitate access of these large amounts of data, and several web portals have been developed and widely used. Genomic Data Commons (GDC) data portal (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), ICGC data portal (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and CPTAC data portal (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) are main repositories to browse, query and download data for their corresponding consortium members projects. cBioPortal provides advanced gene-centered query and visualization functions across multiple studies (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Oncoscape offers numerous interactive analysis and visualization tools for individual TCGA study (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Xena provides an interactive sample-level visualization of multi-omics datasets for individual integrated study (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). COSMIC provides the most comprehensive catalog of somatic mutations in cancer (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). LinkedOmics (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) provides analysis and visualization of associations between different types of molecular features including proteomic datasets from CPTAC. OASIS integrates both tumor tissue and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) data to enable identifying cell lines carrying a mutation of interest for further functional and therapeutic study (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p>
    <p>Within these extremely valuable tools, GDC portal, ICGC portal and cBioPortal (beta version) recently enabled selection of patients across multiple studies, as a <italic>virtual cohort</italic> for exploratory analysis and comparison. However, many analytical and visualization functions essential for discovery analysis of single cohort or comparison of two relevant cohorts are not adequately addressed. For example, multivariate Cox regression analysis is often needed to control confounding variables, which is not available in the existing tools. In addition, none of these tools provides genomic analysis functions, including tumor mutational burden (TMB) estimation, mutational signature analysis and driver gene analysis, which are essential to investigate genomic landscape of a user-defined cohort. Furthermore, cohort analysis functions (e.g. dimensional reduction, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, unsupervised clustering) are lacking for the rapidly growing proteomic datasets from CPTAC.</p>
    <p>To address the above challenges, we developed the Cancer Virtual Cohort Discovery Analysis Platform (CVCDAP), an interactive and customizable toolbox for molecular and clinical analysis of user-defined cancer virtual cohorts, to complement with the existing data portals.</p>

    <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
    <sec id="SEC2-1">
      <title>Data sources</title>
      <p>Somatic mutations and transcriptomic data were downloaded from PanCanAtlas (version 20190101). The TCGA PanCancer Atlas MC3 set consists of uniform re-calling results by the Multi-Center Mutation Calling in Multiple Cancers project to remove batch effects, and was imported to enable robust cross-tumor-type genomic analyses, and batch-corrected mRNA expression levels (FPKM) was imported for unbiased gene expression analysis. Copy number data (thresholded GISTIC2 focal-level score) were downloaded from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) hub. Proteomics data were download from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) data portal to import relative abundance of proteins generated by the Common Data Analysis Pipeline (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Clinical data (survival time, tumor site, age, ethnicity and grade) were downloaded from both PanCanAtlas and CPTAC for corresponding samples with molecular data, and only primary tumors were included in CVCDAP. Details will be updated online for each release.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC2-2">
      <title>Pre-processing of expression data</title>
      <p>We used R package <italic>impute</italic> to perform KNN imputation within individual cancer type for both mRNA and proteins expression data. Regarding multiple samples from the same patient, median values were used for patient-level analysis. For RNA-seq data, FPKM values was converted to TPM and log2 transformed before importing into the database. For proteomic data, downloaded expression matrix was subjected to quantile normalization using <italic>normalizeQuantiles</italic> function implemented in R package <italic>limma</italic> (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) v3.36.1. All CVCDAP data were stored in a MySQL relationship database (version 5.7). Details will be updated online for each release.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC2-3">
      <title>Integrated analysis tools and job running</title>
      <p>CVCDAP developed dozens of tools to enable customized cohort-level data analysis with a uniform web user interface, by in-house pipeline scripts to utilize multiple R packages (<italic>maftools</italic> (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) v1.8.0, <italic>deconstructSigs</italic> v1.8.0, <italic>limma</italic> (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) v3.36.1, <italic>Rtsne</italic> v0.15, <italic>survival</italic> v2.43.3, and <italic>survminer</italic> v0.4.4) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software v3.0 (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In addition to result files, CVCDAP allows experienced users to download input files (in Rdata format) for their further analysis running locally. After user submission of an analysis request, the records will be available in the analysis history for future access. A detailed documentation introducing parameters details of each analysis tool and tutorial slides illustrating how to perform the case studies using CVCDAP are available online for new users.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC2-4">
      <title>Website development</title>
      <p>The website is free and open to all users. There is no login requirement to access any feature; however, the logged-in user can reuse and share the results of their cohorts, which are stored and managed in a MySQL relational database. The server-side interface is implemented using JSP (Java Server Pages) running on an Apache Tomcat web server, with Spring (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://spring.io/">https://spring.io/</ext-link>) and MyBatis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-3/">https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-3/</ext-link>) frameworks employed to improve the efficiency and stability of the web services. The client-side interface is developed using HTML5, JavaScript native and third-party libraries including Bootstrap (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://getbootstrap.com/">http://getbootstrap.com/</ext-link>) and jQuery (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jquery.com">http://jquery.com</ext-link>). The interactive charts and tables that summarize a cohort are based on DataTables.js (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.datatables.net/">https://www.datatables.net/</ext-link>) and ECharts.js (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.echartsjs.com/zh/index.html">https://www.echartsjs.com/zh/index.html</ext-link>) JavaScript libraries.</p>

    <title>RESULTS</title>
    <p>CVCDAP imported and pre-processed the molecular and clinical data from PanCanAtlas and CPTAC that includes a total of 11 263 patients across 33 cancer types in the release 2019. Moreover, it allows users to upload their own datasets to combine with the integrated public data in CVCDAP for query and analysis. The schematic overview of CVCDAP is illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>; key components and features are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref> and elucidated in the following sections.</p>

      <title>Convenient construction and management of virtual cohorts</title>
      <p>CVCDAP provides the flexibility to allow users to create a virtual cohort consisting of samples from single or multiple studies sharing common molecular and/or clinical characteristics. A virtual cohort can be defined by applying any of tissue features (tissue of origin, disease type), clinical features (stage, grade, gender, ethnicity and age), molecular features (somatic mutations, tumor mutational burden, copy number estimate, level of mRNA or protein expression aberration) or a combination of features at discretion. It can also be directly created based on a list of patient/sample IDs provided by users from previous analysis or knowledge.</p>
      <p>Created cohorts can be saved for operations with another saved cohort, including union, intersection or subtraction. Registered users can share a saved cohort to the community (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) by enabling the sharing function and providing the URL for open access. Together, these features enable CVCDAP to conveniently and effectively create virtual cohorts of relevance for a wide range of biological and clinical questions.</p>

      <title>A built-in interactive and customizable toolbox for cohort-level molecular and clinical analysis</title>
      <p>Virtual cohorts from query results can be directly used as input for built-in analysis and visualization tools. For a single cohort, we provided: (i) 12 analysis tools to characterize genomic aberrations, including plotting a sample-level overview of genomic landscape, and identification of potential driver genes, mutational spectrum and signature, co-occurring or exclusive patterns, etc.; (ii) tools for dimensionality reduction and unsupervised clustering analysis based on gene expression and protein abundance respectively; (iii) univariate and multi-variate analysis tools to evaluate and visualize statistical associations of specific molecular aberration (mutation or overexpression/downregulation), and/or clinical variables with patient outcome.</p>
      <p>For cohort comparison, what we offered includes: (i) analysis tools to compare genomic landscapes and mutation hotspots of two cohorts side-by-side, as well as to identify and visualize differentially mutated genes; (ii) analysis tools for differential expression analysis and GSEA analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic profiles between two cohorts, as well as common visualization functions including box plot, heatmap and volcano plot; (iii) univariate and multi-variate analysis tools to evaluate and visualize statistical associations of specific molecular aberration and/or clinical parameters with patient outcome.</p>
      <p>A uniform user interface (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) is provided for each CVCDAP analysis tool to hide the complexity of running the underlying software tools from end users. Submitted analysis tasks are listed at the ‘Analysis History’ page (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), which lists input cohort(s), parameters and results files of each analysis task for reproducibility. Together, this interactive and customizable toolbox allows users to re-analyze their defined cohorts of interests on the fly, with elegant visualization of analysis results.</p>
      <p>Given these advanced features, CVCDAP could enable rapid discovery of molecular mechanisms underlying biological/clinical subjects of interest. We demonstrated the advantages of CVCDAP by two case studies, which conveniently reproduced published findings, as well as revealed novel insights.</p>

      <p>African Americans have higher breast cancer mortality rate compared to white patients. Conventionally, this survival gap has been attributed to variability in financial level, disease stage, subtype and clinical management (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), notwithstanding recent studies indicated biological difference may also account for the racial/ethnic inequity in breast cancer outcome (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). By analyzing a total of 793 TCGA stage I-III breast cancer patients (148 African Americans versus 645 white patients, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) in CVCDAP, we identified that three genes with ethnicity-specific expression pattern are significantly associated with tumor recurrence. First, we compared gene expression profiles between two ethnic groups of patients and identified 27 genes with significant difference (<italic>Benjamini</italic> and <italic>Hochberg</italic> adjusted <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 and log2 fold change &gt; 1.5, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), in which expression of three genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) are also associated with disease-free interval (DFI) (Log-rank test; <italic>IL6ST</italic>, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001; <italic>SCUBE2</italic>, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0031; <italic>MSLN</italic>, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0033) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). After adjusting for the clinical variables (age and stage), high expression of <italic>IL6ST</italic> and <italic>SCUBE2</italic>, and low expression of <italic>MSLN</italic> are still associated with better prognosis, respectively. Interestingly, separate adjustment for each of these three genes decreased the hazard ratio and statistical significance of the ethnic association with tumor recurrence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1A–C</xref>). We also compared genomic profiles of two groups of patients and revealed African Americans harbored more <italic>TP53</italic> mutations and fewer <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1D and E</xref>), which agrees with previous studies (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). However, mutations in neither <italic>TP53</italic> nor <italic>PIK3CA</italic> were associated with patient prognosis. Taken together, our analysis revealed three candidate genes for further investigation. Although the number of African Americans is relatively small and socioeconomic factors have not been taken into account due to the lack in the original TCGA study (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), it highlights the needs for further studies to investigate the molecular landscape of cancer in minority and under-represented populations.</p>

      <title>Evaluation of clinical utilities of <italic>POLE</italic> and <italic>POLD1</italic> mutations in endometrial cancer</title>
      <p>DNA polymerase epsilon (<italic>POLE</italic>) and delta 1 (<italic>POLD1</italic>) are essential for proofreading and faithful replication of DNA, and mutations in <italic>POLE</italic> or <italic>POLD1</italic> are widely distributed across multiple cancer types. CVCDAP pan-cancer analysis identified that uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) (<italic>n</italic> = 530) has the highest mutation frequency for <italic>POLE</italic> (15%) and <italic>POLD1</italic> (8%) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) among 19 cancer types with patients harboring <italic>POLE/POLD1</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Although clinical implications of <italic>POLE</italic> mutations have been suggested in UCEC (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), the clinical significance of <italic>POLD1</italic> mutations has not been investigated yet, to our knowledge. Thus, we utilized CVCDAP to conduct a comprehensive analysis of UCEC patients with <italic>POLE</italic> or <italic>POLD1</italic> mutations. First, the univariate analysis identified that patients with <italic>POLE/POLD1</italic> mutation were significantly associated with better overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), progression-free interval (PFI) and DFI (Log-rank test, OS, <italic>P</italic>  =  0.0019; DSS, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0024; PFI, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001; DFI, <italic>P</italic> = 0.028) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>). The associations remain statistically significant after adjusting for age and grade (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3B</xref>). UCEC patients with <italic>POLE/POLD1</italic> mutations exhibited significantly greater TMB than those without mutations (Wilcoxon rank sum test, <italic>P</italic>  &lt; 2.2e-16) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Additionally, we confirmed <italic>POLE</italic> codons 286 and 411 in exonuclease domain as mutation hotspots (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>) and no hotpot mutation was seen in <italic>POLD1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3C</xref>) (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Furthermore, GSEA analysis revealed a significant up-regulation of pathways (FDR &lt; 0.25) in <italic>POLE/POLD1</italic> mutant tumors, which are related to immune response activity including natural killer cell–mediated cytotoxicity and T-cell receptor signaling (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). These results (increased TMB and upregulation of immune response activity) imply UCEC samples with <italic>POLE/POLD1</italic> mutations could benefit from immune-checkpoint inhibitors as indicated in the previous pan-cancer studies (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest combined mutation status of <italic>POLE</italic> and <italic>POLD1</italic> has potential clinical utilities for endometrial carcinoma patients, although further clinical investigation is needed for metastatic UCEC patients treated with immunotherapy.</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>CVCDAP is a web-based platform to allow flexible selection of cancer patients of relevance as virtual cohorts for specific research and clinical questions, with a toolbox of analytic and visualization functions empowered for discovering and comparing molecular and clinical profiles of user-defined cohorts. We illustrated the value of cohort-level re-analysis of published data in generating novel hypothesis, which is essential for a number of reasons: (i) The original published study usually includes a smaller dataset, thus statistical power is underestimated to detect low-frequency mutations or low expression variations. (ii) Overlaying additional features, such as patient outcome, will help rank candidate genes for further investigation. (iii) Extending previous signatures with additional genes included from latest relevant research findings, which could be easily validated using the same cohort. There are more scenarios than we can enumerate here, the community could conveniently and effectively reveal all possibilities for their questions of interest via CVCDAP.</p>
    <p>CVCDAP will be updated quarterly, with more analytical functions and interactive plots developed, as well as additional valuable cohort-based public datasets integrated in the future, such as the recently launched ICGC-ARGO project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.icgc-argo.org/">https://www.icgc-argo.org/</ext-link>), which will collect molecular and clinical data from about 100,000 cancer patients participating in clinical trials. With these further developments, CVCDAP will complement other available tools to help biological and clinical researchers reveal the molecular mechanisms and indicate novel therapeutic approaches from the massive amount of public cancer-related data.</p>
