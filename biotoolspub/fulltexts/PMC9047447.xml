      <p>We
present DEIMoS: Data Extraction for Integrated Multidimensional
Spectrometry, a Python application programming interface (API) and
command-line tool for high-dimensional mass spectrometry data analysis
workflows that offers ease of development and access to efficient
algorithmic implementations. Functionality includes feature detection,
feature alignment, collision cross section (CCS) calibration, isotope
detection, and MS/MS spectral deconvolution, with the output comprising
detected features aligned across study samples and characterized by
mass, CCS, tandem mass spectra, and isotopic signature. Notably, DEIMoS
operates on <italic>N</italic>-dimensional data, largely agnostic
to acquisition instrumentation; algorithm implementations simultaneously
utilize all dimensions to (i) offer greater separation between features,
thus improving detection sensitivity, (ii) increase alignment/feature
matching confidence among data sets, and (iii) mitigate convolution
artifacts in tandem mass spectra. We demonstrate DEIMoS with LC-IMS-MS/MS
metabolomics data to illustrate the advantages of a multidimensional
approach in each data processing step.</p>

  <p id="sec1">The ability
to process raw instrument
data reliably and accurately is critical to any molecular profiling
assay. Though useful, commercial software solutions provided by vendors
of mass spectrometry (MS) instrumentation lack flexibility required
to rapidly adapt to evolving community needs. Demand for open-source,
community-driven development has motivated researchers to pursue alternatives
across instrument platforms, for example liquid or gas chromatography
(LC or GC) and ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) coupled to mass spectrometry
(MS), including tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Software implementations
also differ in their offered functionality: data input/output, multidimensional
feature detection, alignment across samples, isotope detection, and
deconvolution of MS/MS spectra. However, few available open-source,
platform-agnostic solutions provide such core functionality for data
of high-dimensionality, hindering the development and application
of new instrumentation and analysis paradigms.</p>
  <p>These limitations
are predominantly tied to the specificity—and
thus, relative inflexibility—of existing software and algorithm
implementations. For example, LC or GC coupled to MS or MS/MS results
in two primary feature dimensions, the retention time/index and MS
mass-to-charge ratio (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>), which
is reflected in community software algorithms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> Existing feature detection algorithms are tailored to the underlying
data: features are detected in one or two dimensions, and dimensions
are often inflexibly constrained based on respective assumptions.
In the short term, instrumentation advances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> force platform-specific software to either ignore additional dimensions—for
instance, summing across the least-distinguishing dimensions—or
iteratively apply one- or two-dimensional algorithms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Over time, wider instrument adoption engenders development
to extend or modify existing algorithms to take full advantage of
additional separation dimensions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> The problem
is thus cyclical in nature: for software to adapt to technology, the
technology must be mature and widely used, but for technology to mature
and achieve widespread adoption, instrument data must be robustly
analyzed by user-friendly software.</p>
  <p>To overcome this paradox,
instrument vendors have historically
developed and supplied the software required to process the data,
for example, Agilent MassHunter, Bruker MetaboScape, and Waters Progenesis
QI. However, vendor offerings have their own limitations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> Because the underlying software is proprietary,
details of underlying algorithm implementations are neither available
to the public via open-source codebases nor sufficiently documented
in publications. Moreover, vendor software is often tailored to a
specific instrument and involves proprietary data formats, limiting
one-to-one comparison of data across different instrument or vendor
types. In some cases, existing software can also lack customizability;
for instance, algorithm selection tends to be fixed to specific peak
detection, alignment, and deconvolution implementations, unless additional
options are explicitly implemented by the vendor. Thus, users are
subject to the functionality provided by the vendor software, or must
assemble multiple software solutions into one workflow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> Finally, many vendor solutions are automated only to a small degree,
thus impeding reproducibility, and are not amenable to high-performance
(HPC) or cloud computing.</p>
  <p>As a result, the metabolomics community
has worked to develop open-source
solutions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> Each cover either some or all of the steps in a typical
metabolomics workflow and are positioned to analyze GC-MS or LC-MS
data (MS-DIAL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> additionally handles some
aspects of LC-IMS-MS data) and tandem MS. These software tools offer
insight into best practices and algorithm implementations and serve
as foundational references for our work. However, challenges remain
in supporting data of arbitrary dimensionality, generalizing algorithmic
implementations to operate in native dimensionality, offering flexibility
and control over the analysis workflow, and scaling efficiently to
computational resources.</p>
  <p>To this end, we present the design
and implementation of DEIMoS,
or Data Extraction for Multidimensional Spectrometry, and include
an initial evaluation on LC-IMS-MS/MS metabolomics data from analysis
of blood plasma samples. DEIMoS’s functionality is generalized
through use of <italic>N</italic>-dimensional signal processing algorithms
from the open-source, efficient, and widely used Python-based scientific
computing packages NumPy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> and SciPy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> Additionally, DEIMoS’s design makes minimal
assumptions about each underlying dimension. As a result, researchers
may analyze GC-MS, LC-MS, IMS-MS, or LC-IMS-MS data, or another hypothetical
MS-based platform, with or without MS/MS, using the same software
with minimal reconfiguration. The underlying source code has also
been written to account for hypothetical additional separation or
analytical dimensions that may be introduced as instrumentation continues
to advance (e.g., solid phase extraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> and associated chemical class-based separation, cryogenic infrared
spectroscopy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> or multiplexed higher resolution
ion mobility separations such as provided by structures for lossless
ion manipulations, SLIM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup>). That is, calls
to the application programming interface (API) and logic of the analysis
may change, but the underlying source code can remain intact. This
paradigm facilitates rapid advancement in metabolomics and introduces
the potential to unify community efforts in informatics software development.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, DEIMoS benefits from Python’s rich existing
ecosystem for scientific programming and offers even greater flexibility
beyond the core API. DEIMoS’s functionality is organized into
several modules, each addressing one or more key data processing steps,
including file input and output, peak detection, alignment, isotope
detection, MS2 spectra extraction and deconvolution, and data subsetting
operations. We describe each module relative to LC-IMS-MS/MS data,
which represents higher dimensionality—and, by extension, complexity—among
most current metabolomics analysis techniques. Data acquired on other
platforms—for example, LC-MS(/MS), GC-MS(/MS)—require
similar processing but in a lower dimensional space. Future algorithms
and additional dimensions of data may be slotted in easily.</p>
  <p>We architected DEIMoS to adhere to software development best practices,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> including installation through Anaconda<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> or PyPI,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> in-line

    <title>Methods</title>
    <sec id="sec2.1">
      <title>Experimental Methods</title>
      <p>To demonstrate DEIMoS, we examined
LC-IMS-MS/MS data from a large study of human plasma samples consisting
of 40 quality control (QC) samples from the NIST Standard Reference
Material 1950<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> and 112 study samples.
An internal standard mixture was added prior to extraction, its composition
listed in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c05017/suppl_file/ac1c05017_si_001.pdf">SI</ext-link>. Each sample was spiked
with 50 μL of a solution of the internal standards at 0.166
mg/mL in water. Metabolites and lipids were extracted with concomitant
protein precipitation using the Matyash protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> The
metabolite layer was removed and dried in vacuo. Lipid and protein
layers were not analyzed.</p>
      <p>An Agilent 1260 Infinity II high flow
liquid chromatography system (San Jose, CA) equipped with a Vial Sampler
and Binary Pump was used to inject and chromatographically separate
samples prior to introduction to the ion mobility spectrometry-mass
spectrometry instrument. A steady flow rate of 0.300 mL/min was delivered
through a Millipore-Sigma (Burlington, MA) SeQuant Zic-pHILIC column
(15 cm length, 2.1 mm inner diameter, packed with 5 μm particles).
A corresponding guard column of the same packing material was also
used. Mobile phases consisted of (A) 20 μM ammonium acetate
in water and (B) 100% acetonitrile with the following gradient profile
(min, %B): 0, 90; 4, 90; 12, 20; 13, 10; 15, 10; 17, 90. An Agilent
1100 Column Heater was used with a static temperature of 45 °C.</p>
      <p>Ion mobility spectrometry-tandem mass spectrometry analysis was
performed using an Agilent 6560 Ion Mobility LC/Q-TOF system. Spectra
were acquired separately in both positive and negative ionization
modes. Data were collected in the mass range of 50–1700 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>. Ionization was accomplished using
a Dual AJS ESI source, with gas temperature set to 325 °C, drying
gas set to 5 L/min, nebulizer set to 30 psi, sheath gas temperature
set to 275 °C, sheath gas flow of 11 L/min, VCap set to 2500
V, nozzle voltage set to 2000 V, and the fragmentor set to 400 V.
For the ion mobility separations, the trap fill time was 30 000
μs and released for 300 μs. Frame rate was 1 frame/s,
19 IM transitions/frame, and max drift time set to 50 ms. Fixed collision
energies were employed at 10, 20, and 40 eV on alternating frames.
Data were collected for 22 min immediately following the injection
of the sample.</p>
      <p>To communicate generalizability to other instrument
platforms and/or
data types, we acquired data from a Bruker timsTOF Pro and a Waters
UPLC i-Class coupled to a Synapt G2Si. The former was obtained from
the Mass Spectrometry Interactive Virtual Environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> (MassIVE, accession MSV000088020), the latter from Metabolights<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref></sup> (accession MTBLS812). The Bruker instrument
implements trapped ion mobility, resulting in measurements of inverse
reduced mobility as opposed to drift time; the Waters instrument implements
traveling wave ion mobility.</p>

      <title>Overview</title>
      <p>DEIMoS was developed as
an instrument-independent,
high-dimensional metabolomics data analysis tool, and design choices
reflect this philosophy. DEIMoS is written in Python, prioritizing
user productivity, and ease of development and use. While high-level
interpreted languages, such as Python, often suffer from reduced computational
efficiency, many popular scientific Python libraries, such as NumPy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> and SciPy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> wrap
C or Fortran code and are, thus, highly optimized. In addition, Python
is ubiquitous across the sciences and in industry, user-friendly,
and largely agnostic to client platform (Windows, macOS, Linux). As
a result, Python boasts a large, active, and continually growing community
in the sciences, positioning Python-based software for wide adoption
both by users and collaborative developers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup> DEIMoS is one of few Python-based offerings for metabolomics data
processing uniquely offering support for data of any dimension, algorithmic
implementations that operate in native dimensionality, flexibility
and control over the analysis workflow, and efficient scaling to computational
resources. An overview of functionality is depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>. All computation was performed

      <title>File Input/Output</title>
      <p>To accommodate disparate instrument
types and manufacturers (e.g., Bruker, Waters, Thermo, Agilent), DEIMoS
operates under the assumption that input data are in an open, standard
format. As of this publication, the accepted file format for DEIMoS
is mzML,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref></sup> which contains metadata, separation,
and spectrometry data that reproduce the contents of vendor formats.
Conversion to mzML from several other formats can be performed using
the free and open-source ProteoWizard <italic>msconvert</italic> utility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> By default, DEIMoS exports a lightweight, data
frame-based representation in Hierarchical Data Format version 5 (HDF5)
file format.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref></sup> Additionally, adaptors are
included to support exporting to delimited text (e.g., CSV), Mascot
Generic Format (MGF), and mzML for downstream use with other tools
(e.g., MAME,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref></sup> LIQUID,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref></sup> GNPS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref></sup>).</p>

      <title>Feature Detection</title>
      <p>Feature detection, also referred
to as peak detection, is the process by which local maxima that fulfill
certain criteria (such as sufficient signal-to-noise ratio) are located
in the signal acquired by a given analytical instrument. This process
results in “features” associated with the analysis of
molecular analytes from the sample under study or from chemical, instrument,
or random noise. Typically, feature detection involves a mass dimension
(<italic>m/z</italic>), as well as one or more separation dimensions,
the latter offering distinction among isobaric/isotopic features.</p>
      <p>DEIMoS implements an N-dimensional maximum filter from <italic>scipy.ndimage</italic> that convolves the instrument signal with a structuring element,
also known as a kernel, and compares the result against the input
array to identify local maxima as candidate features or peaks. We
discuss what qualifies as a dimension in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c05017/suppl_file/ac1c05017_si_001.pdf">SI</ext-link>. Additional filters, including integral and average intensity, kurtosis,
skew, etc., can be applied to yield statistics for later downselection.
To provide additional confidence in detected features, we required
that a given feature be observed across analytical triplicates.</p>
      <p>Key to this process is the selection of kernel size, which can
vary by instrument, data set, and even compound. For example, in LC-IMS-MS/MS
data, peak width increases with increasing <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> and drift time, and also varies in retention time. Ideally,
the kernel would be the same size as the N-dimensional peak (i.e.,
wavelets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref></sup>), though computational efficiency considerations
for high-dimensional data currently limit the ability to dynamically
adjust kernel size. Thus, the selected kernel size should be representative
of likely features of interest. In some scenarios, dynamic kernel
size may be appropriate, per the kernel selection discussion in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c05017/suppl_file/ac1c05017_si_001.pdf">SI</ext-link>.</p>
      <p>While we recommend processing the data
in its native dimensionality,
DEIMoS’s algorithms are flexible and can detect features in
iterative subspaces, for example 2D followed by 1D, 1D followed by
2D, or successive 1D. We used the same parameters per dimension to
evaluate feature detection in all dimensional permutations for LC-IMS-MS
data. Features were only kept if they appeared across all three analytical
replicates. To compare methods, we (i) compared feature coordinates
directly and (ii) used tolerances of ±20 ppm, ± 1.5%, and
±0.3 min for <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>, drift time,
and retention time, respectively, based on peak dimensions determined
during kernel size selection (Bruker and Waters values differ here,
as reported in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c05017/suppl_file/ac1c05017_si_001.pdf">SI</ext-link>). We used relative
tolerances, such as parts-per-million and percent for <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> and drift time, respectively, because unlike
in the retention time dimension, peak widths in <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> and drift time varied with mass (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c05017/suppl_file/ac1c05017_si_001.pdf">Figure S1</ext-link>).

      <title>Alignment</title>
      <p>Alignment is the process by which feature
coordinates across samples are adjusted to account for instrument
variation (drift, calibration, etc.) such that matching features are
aligned to adjust for small differences in coordinates. To perform
alignment, we first constructed a model for each dimension of a sample
by putatively matching detected features against an in-study reference
sample, minimizing the residual, and subsequently applying the fit
transform. Next, we matched corresponding features across data sets
within a user defined tolerance. We refer to the former as “reference-based
alignment” and the latter as “cross-sample alignment”.</p>
      <p>For reference-based alignment, we defined corresponding features
between two samples based on minimum distance in the dimension of
interest and selected tolerances to accommodate potentially complex
nonlinear relationships. We suggest visualizing putative matches with
multiple tolerance selections. Once features were matched, we modeled
the relationship between samples using support vector regression (SVR)
as implemented in <italic>scikit-learn</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref></sup> While SVR was selected here for its broad applicability
to both linear and nonlinear alignment, many approaches have been
successfully developed in this space,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref></sup> and SVR is not necessarily superior.</p>
      <p>Many existing algorithms
and implementations can perform cross-sample
alignment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref></sup> We initially
explored use of a modified version of the “join align”
method from MZmine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> but ultimately arrived
at an agglomerative clustering-based approach. Though similar with
respect to resulting alignment, the agglomerative clustering-based
approach was more amenable to processing many samples simultaneously.
Additional details on the agglomerative clustering implementation
can be found in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c05017/suppl_file/ac1c05017_si_001.pdf">SI</ext-link>.</p>
      <p>By default,
alignment considers all features detected among data
sets, though users may design more complicated and restrictive workflows
using the DEIMoS API. For example, users may choose to only align
features that appear across some number of replicates or exclude features
that appear in blank samples.</p>
      <p>To demonstrate alignment functionality,
we analyzed all acquired
data files (<italic>N</italic> = 912, 54, and 21 for Agilent, Bruker,
and Waters data, respectively). First, we performed alignment across
analytical replicates and only kept features appearing in triplicate.
Next, we performed alignment across samples in both positive and negative
electrospray ionization (ESI) modes, as available. Samples were aligned
by agglomerative clustering method with maximum linkage distance tolerances
in each dimension of ±20 ppm, ± 1.5%, and ±0.3 min
for <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>, drift time, and retention
time, respectively. Tolerances for Bruker and Waters values differ,
as reported in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c05017/suppl_file/ac1c05017_si_001.pdf">SI</ext-link>.</p>

      <title>MS2 Extraction</title>
      <p>With MS1 features of interest determined
by peak detection, corresponding tandem mass spectra, if available,
must be extracted and assigned to the MS1 parent ion feature. For
data independent acquisition, we use non-<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> dimensions to assign fragments; for instance, drift time
and retention time are used to match fragments in LC-IMS-MS/MS. These
additional separations enable better attribution of MS2 ions to parent
ions, a form of deconvolution inherent in the acquisition, but convolution
artifacts can still occur.</p>
      <p>Explicit, algorithmic deconvolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref></sup> has been implemented
in DEIMoS such that MS1 and MS2 features overlapping in non-<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> separation dimensions are disambiguated
to minimize false assignments. In this form of deconvolution, similar
to the approach in Yin et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref></sup> the profiles
of non-<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> separation dimensions
are used to identify only those ions in the MS2 with distributions
that correspond to the precursor ion distribution. This technique
simultaneously excludes MS2 ions arising from noise or chemical background,
while also attributing MS2 ions only to precursor ions with similar
separation distributions. Correspondence is determined by cosine similarity,
producing a value between 0 and 100 for each separation dimension
for all MS1: MS2 pairings. The user may then filter putative matches
by this value, for example considering only those above some tolerance
in one or more of the separation dimensions.</p>

      <title>Collision Cross Section
Calibration</title>
      <p>To yield collision
cross section (CCS) from IMS arrival time, a calibration must be performed
using a standard tune mix containing compounds of known CCS. Drift
times, or analogous measurement, such as inverse reduced mobility
in TIMS, are reported by the instrument and calibrated against the
known CCS values to yield calibration coefficients <italic>beta</italic> and <italic>tfix</italic>. For drift tube and trapped IMS, the single-field
calibration equation detailed in Stow et al. and as implemented in
Lee et al. was used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref></sup> For traveling wave IMS, the relationship
between measurement and CCS was first linearized by the natural logarithm,
then fit by linear regression. DEIMoS performs this calibration given
arrival times (or analogous measurement), known CCS values, <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>, and nominal charge of each calibrant.
Correlation coefficient and sum of residuals are reported to characterize
goodness of fit. Users may also supply <italic>beta</italic> and <italic>tfix</italic> directly.</p>

interest is supplied and the feature of maximal intensity in the remaining

detecting an internal standard that has been spiked into a sample

Detection</title>
      <p>Feature detection for a subset of

          <p>Multidimensional peak
detection. Peak detection involves convolving
the input signal in N dimensions (here, in LC-IMS-MS, 3D) with a maximum
filter. The input and maximum filtered arrays are then compared point-by-point
and, where equal, a local maximum is indicated. While the data is
collected in 3D, this approach is best visualized in 2D and 1D projections,
capturing all lower dimensional representations of the underlying
3D data. Note a well-defined peak in a given 2D view may or may not
correspond to a true 3D apex, or can be the product of multiple underlying
features. It is, thus, important to interpret the 1D projections carefully.
For this subset of the data, the top 10 most intense local maxima
are shown, colored by <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>, with
similar <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> (i.e., isopologues)
sharing hues.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>For all acquired samples, we compared
permutations of the possible
feature detection modes (3D, 2D followed by 1D, 1D followed by 2D,
and iterative 1D). Notably, LC-IMS-MS/MS data exist in a 3D space;
thus, the underlying features are also represented in 3D. Iterative
feature detection in lower-dimensional projections simplifies the
resulting data structure by summing along nonprojection axes, potentially
introducing artifacts. In practice, some projections, such as <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> versus drift time, are affected less
significantly than others, such as drift time versus retention time,
the latter suffering significant information loss when summing along
the <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> axis.</p>
      <p>We anticipated
that processing the data in all 3 dimensions simultaneously
would result in the greatest separation among features to better isolate
the local maxima. That is, given the same feature detection tolerances
across methods, 3D feature detection would theoretically afford the
least overlap and, by extension, greatest number of features. Per <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c05017/suppl_file/ac1c05017_si_001.pdf">Figure S4</ext-link>, a contrary result was, thus, surprising.
However, the coordinates of the features detected by lower dimensional
projections are not always congruent with the 3D approach (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c05017/suppl_file/ac1c05017_si_001.pdf">Figure S5</ext-link>). This signals that the projections
along the various data axes, whether 1D or 2D, aggregate signal to
the point of, in some cases, losing the underlying feature defined
in 3D – the sum operation along a given axis “merges”
previously separated features, skewing the coordinate in that dimension.</p>
      <p>However, this phenomenon is pronounced to varying degree among
methods: the most comparable technique, as implemented by MS-DIAL—<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> versus RT followed by DT—results
in poor agreement when considering strict tolerances (only ∼13%
intersection in both positive and negative mode), but intersection
increases substantially (to ∼90%) when imposing the same tolerances
that would be used in cross-sample alignment. That is, tolerances
that would result in the combining of those features anyway. In this
case, the lower dimensional projections result in slight differences
in feature coordinates, but in practical application would be treated
as “same”. The difference resulted in slightly less
accurate characterization of feature coordinates, for example exact <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>, drift time (and by extension CCS),
and retention time, where different, deviated by an average of 5.8
ppm, 0.2%, and 0.05 min for <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>,
drift time, and retention time, respectively, when comparing 3D processing
to <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> versus RT followed by DT.
Additional comparisons are depicted in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c05017/suppl_file/ac1c05017_si_001.pdf">Figure S6</ext-link>. Critically, the order of peak picking operations had a
large impact on the number and composition of the features detected
(e.g., comparing 1D–2D to 2D–1D operations, as well
as the consecutive 1D operations).</p>
      <p>A key advantage of feature
detection in native dimensionality is
that computation time does not scale with the number of features (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c05017/suppl_file/ac1c05017_si_001.pdf">Figure S4</ext-link>). Peak detection in native dimensionality
required 0.54 ± 0.11 core-hours and 0.57 ± 0.11 core-hours
per data file for positive and negative ionization modes, respectively
(mean ± standard deviation). Cumulatively, 373.74 core-hours
for all 912 data files.</p>
      <p>For the Bruker data, because the data
were collected at higher
resolution (1 728 842, 937, and 4769 unique values for <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>, inverse reduced mobility, and retention
time, respectively; collectively 165 times the Agilent resolution),
processing time for peak detection was much longer at 12.20 ±
1.35 core-hours and 35.83 ± 15.23 core-hours per data file for
positive and negative ionization modes, respectively (mean ±
standard deviation). The Waters data, which was collected at lower
resolution (79 863, 200, and 707 unique values for <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>, drift time, and retention time, respectively;
collectively 0.25 times the Agilent resolution), required less processing
time for peak detection: 0.33 ± 0.03 core-hours for positive
ionization mode (negative mode not collected).</p>
      <p>The longer processing
times for the negative ionization mode data
were due to signal being observed over a larger range of unique <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>, drift (or analogous measurement),
and retention times. The array partitioning leveraged for multicore
computation split along the <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> dimension.
For each partition, computation scaled with the number of observed
measurements spanning remaining dimensions. Computation also scaled
with number of partitions, in that empty partitions were not processed.
To ameliorate, a nominal intensity threshold may be applied to decrease
signal span of the 3D space. Said threshold must be selected at or
below the noise floor in the data.</p>

mode appearing across each of 3 analytical replicates, excluding features
that appeared in all blank samples. Though tolerances were selected
according to expected variance across samples, agglomerative clustering
resulted in tighter linkages (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c05017/suppl_file/ac1c05017_si_001.pdf">Figure S8</ext-link>), indicating intersample variance is lower than typical peak width.
This variance reaches near-maximal values at 15 ppm in <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>, 1% in drift time, and 0.2 min in retention.
Thus, exploratory analysis of the data enables users to characterize
interfeature and intersample variance to set appropriate tolerances
relative to the source of maximum variance, though agglomerative clustering
is relatively forgiving so long as tolerances are not too small.</p>
      <p>With respect to computation time, reference-based alignment required
on the order of milliseconds per file. For cross-sample alignment,
each set of 3 analytical replicates (<italic>N</italic> = 304) required
39.89 ± 6.59 and 44.90 ± 5.53 core-seconds for positive
and negative mode, respectively (mean ± standard deviation);
cumulatively 3.58 core-hours. Per-file processing times did not significantly
differ for the Bruker and Waters data.</p>
      <p>Aligning those features
that appeared in each analytical replicate
required 0.66 and 0.94 core-hours for positive and negative mode,
respectively; cumulatively 1.60 core-hours. Because of the relatively
smaller number of samples, this step only required seconds for the
Bruker and Waters data.</p>

      <title>MS2 extraction</title>
      <p>For the MS1 features
shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>,
we performed deconvolution
to putatively assign ions in the MS2 spectra to corresponding ions
in the MS1 spectra. The utility of deconvolution is highlighted in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>. A window-based
approach yields MS2 spectra that, in the worst case, erroneously include
all ions for all MS1 precursors to give identical MS2 spectra or,
in the best case, results in only two distinct spectra among precursors.
The limitation here is visualized by the plot of drift time versus
retention time, where only two overlapping peaks emerge. Naïve
assignment would thus yield convolved spectra, the degree of convolution
depending on window selection.</p>

        <label>Figure 4</label>
        <caption>
          <p>MS2 deconvolution. The MS2 spectra belonging
to the MS1 features
highlighted in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref> were algorithmically deconvolved. The profiles of the MS1 features
are indicated by respective colors, plotted along the positive <italic>y</italic>-axis for drift time (A) and retention time (B). These
are accompanied by corresponding MS2 profiles, plotted along the negative <italic>y</italic>-axis, colored according to the closest matching MS1 profile
by cosine similarity. Panels C and D show the pairwise cosine similarity
of MS1 and MS2 profiles for drift and retention time, respectively.
In panel E, ions in the MS2 spectra are colored according to the closest
matching MS1 drift time profile. As in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>, only the 10 most intense MS1 features were
explicitly colored; the ions in the MS2 spectra corresponding to remaining
MS1 features, or not sufficiently similar to an MS1 precursor, are
indicated in gray. Note that disambiguating among isotopologues is
not possible here; thus, the difference in color among isotopic groupings
is largely superficial.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Notably, deconvolution
results may differ substantially if employing
the cosine similarity scores of drift versus retention time, as false
positives can occur if using retention time alone. For example, the
masses between 77 and 83 Da would be assigned to the precursor with <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 212 using retention time, whereas they
are sufficiently separated in drift time (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>).</p>
      <p>Computation time required to deconvolve
MS2 spectra was a function
of number of distinct non-<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> separation
dimension populations, as determined by agglomerative clustering,
and the size of each such population. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref> shows one such population. In this analysis,
each data file required 1.18 ± 0.28 core-hours and 2.27 ±
0.31 (mean ± standard deviation) for positive and negative mode,
respectively; cumulatively 1579.07 core-hours. Per-file processing
times did not significantly differ for the Waters data (MS2 not collected
for the Bruker data).</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>Metabolomics and exposomics
data processing tools offer immense
value for diagnosis of disease, evaluation of environmental exposures,
and discovery of novel molecules. However, few open-source solutions
are currently positioned to fully leverage the latest instrumentation.
Importantly, though demonstrated for LC-IMS-MS/MS data, DEIMoS’s
architecture supports extension to other measurement modalities, such
as cryogenic infrared spectroscopy, minimizing development barriers
as instrumentation evolves. Further, all development has been accomplished
using design principles necessary for the long-term success for metabolomics
data: format interoperability, workflow flexibility, open-source software
implementation, community development, and reproducibility.</p>
