    <title>Background</title>
    <p id="Par25">MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs with ~ 22 nucleotides. They usually induce repression or translational inhabitation of target genes through partial complementarities with multiple miRNA response elements (MREs) of the target RNA transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] have shown that miRNAs are involved in a broad range of biological processes, such as cell cycle control, cell apoptosis, cell differentiation and a diverse range of human cancers.</p>
    <p id="Par26">The competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] considers that all types of coding and non-coding RNA transcripts may crosstalk with each other by sharing common miRNAs. By competing with each other, those ceRNAs (also known as miRNA sponges or decoys), including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), pseudogenes, mRNAs and circular RNAs (circRNAs), can release parental target mRNAs from miRNAs’ control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The ceRNA hypothesis challenges the traditional knowledge that coding RNAs only act as targets of miRNAs, and it provides a starting point for the investigation of the biological functions and mechanisms of miRNA sponges.</p>
    <p id="Par27">Recently, several lncRNAs, pseudogenes, circRNAs and mRNAs acting as miRNA sponges have been experimentally identified and confirmed, together with their important biological functions. For example, linc-MD1, a muscle-specific lncRNA, activates muscle-specific gene expression by regulating the expression of MAML1 and MEF2C via sponging miR-133 and miR-135 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. PTENP1, a pseudogene of the PTEN tumor suppression gene, can act as a sponge of PTEN-targeting miRNAs to play a growth-suppressive role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As for circRNAs, CDR1as/ciRS-7 is encoded in the genome antisense to the human CDR1 (gene) locus, and affects the activity of miR-7 target genes by sponging miR-7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Tay et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] have validated two mRNAs (CNOT6L and VAPA) as miRNA sponges that regulate tumor suppressor gene PTEN, antagonise PI3K/AKT signalling, and show concordant expression patterns and copy number loss with PTEN in human cancers.</p>
    <p id="Par28">Although an increasing number of miRNA sponges have been discovered, the wet lab experiment approach for finding them is very time consuming and involves high cost. Thus computational methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] have been proposed to study miRNA sponges. For the identification of miRNA sponge interactions, the two principles, significant common miRNAs at sequence level and positively correlated at expression level, are commonly used in several computational methods. Based on the identified miRNA sponge interaction network, the miRNA sponge modules are identified by using network clustering algorithms. Here, a miRNA sponge module is defined as a cluster of miRNA sponges. It has been shown that there is a great potential to reveal the biological mechanisms in cancer by studying miRNA sponge networks and modules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and the computational methods for identifying miRNA sponge networks and modules can help broaden our study of miRNA sponges and generate hypotheses for wet lab experiments.</p>
    <p id="Par29">Recently, some tools have been developed, including spongeScan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], miRNAsong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], CircInteractome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], miRNACancerMAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and JAMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], to study miRNA sponges. Based on the sequence data of miRNAs and RNA transcripts, the first three web-based tools, spongeScan, miRNAsong and CircInteractome, regard RNA transcripts containing multiple miRNA binding sites as potential miRNA sponges. The principle of the three tools is the same with the <italic>miRNA Homology</italic> (<italic>miRHomology</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] method. The miRNACancerMAP tool uses the <italic>positive correlation</italic> (<italic>pc</italic>) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] to identify lncRNA related miRNA sponge networks. The JAMI tool is a fast implementation of the <italic>hermes</italic> method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] for inferring miRNA sponge networks.</p>
    <p id="Par30">Although these tools have been successfully applied to the study of miRNA sponges, there is still a lack of software tools for systematically identifying and analyzing miRNA sponge interaction networks and modules. Specifically, it is still difficult for researchers to choose suitable computational methods to identify miRNA sponge interactions or modules in their own data, or compare the performance of their newly developed methods with existing methods. Moreover, it is time consuming for both bioinformaticians and biologists to obtain existing algorithms for their studies as there is not a tool which contains a comprehensive collection of the algorithms. To fill this gap, we have developed an R/Bioconductor package, <italic>miRspongeR</italic>, to provide a pipeline for the identification and analysis of miRNA sponge interaction networks and modules. The advantage of the <italic>miRspongeR</italic> package is that it enables bioinformaticians and biologists to quickly compare their proposed methods with existing methods, apply existing methods to their own data, and select suitable methods for assisting in subsequent experimental design.</p>

      <title>Pipeline of miRspongeR</title>
      <p id="Par31">The <italic>miRspongeR</italic> package is written in R. The main pipeline of <italic>miRspongeR</italic> is given in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, which can be separated into three components for the identification and analysis of miRNA sponge interaction networks and modules:<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Pipeline of the miRspongeR package. The pipeline mainly contains three components: Identification of miRNA sponge interactions, Identification of miRNA sponge modules, and Validation and analysis. For the identification of miRNA sponge interactions, out of the eight implemented methods, seven (<italic>miRHomology</italic>, <italic>pc</italic>, <italic>sppc</italic>, <italic>ppc</italic>, <italic>hermes</italic>, <italic>muTaME</italic> and <italic>cernia</italic>) are stand-alone methods and one (<italic>integrateMethod</italic>) is an ensemble method which integrates the prediction results of the component methods. To understand the module-level properties of miRNA sponges, four module identification methods (FN, MCL, LINKCOMM and MCODE) are provided to identify miRNA sponge modules based on the identified miRNA sponge interaction networks. For the validation of miRNA sponge interactions, the ground truth data is used to validate predicted miRNA sponge interactions. Furthermore, enrichment analysis is performed to identify potential diseases, biological processes and pathways associated with miRNA sponge modules. Survival analysis is also performed to identify significant miRNA sponge modules which can distinguish the high and low risk tumor samples. Users can prepare their own datasets as the input to <italic>miRspongeR</italic></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12859_2019_2861_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

      <p id="Par36">For input data, a miRNA-target interaction refers to the relationship of a miRNA and a validated or predicted target gene of the miRNA. The validated or predicted sites of the target gene that bind to the miRNA are known as the miRNA response elements. We say two genes share a miRNA or have a shared miRNA if they both are targets of the miRNA. When two miRNAs have a same target gene and the same miRNA response elements or binding sites on the target gene, we say the two miRNAs share miRNA target sites or they have a sharing of miRNA target sites.</p>

Then, for each candidate RNA pair (RNA<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and RNA<sub><italic>j</italic></sub>), the hypergeometric test is used to evaluate the significance of the shared miRNAs by these two RNAs.

      <title>Identification of miRNA sponge modules</title>
      <p id="Par71">Since modularity is an important property of many biological networks, the discovery and analysis of modules in biological networks have attracted much attention within the bioinformatics community. To understand the module-level properties of miRNA sponges, we implement the <italic>netModule</italic> function to identify miRNA sponge modules from miRNA sponge interaction networks. Here, a miRNA sponge module denotes a cluster of miRNA sponges.</p>
      <p id="Par72">Users can select the FN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], MCL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], LINKCOMM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] or MCODE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] method for module identification. FN is a fast hierarchical agglomeration algorithm, and it is implemented by greedily optimizing the modularity for detecting community structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. MCL relies on the Markov cluster algorithm, and identifies modules in biological networks by a mathematical bootstrapping procedure. The procedure simulates random walks within a biological network by the alternation of two operators called <italic>expansion</italic> and <italic>inflation</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. LINKCOMM is a module identification method from the <italic>linkcomm</italic> R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. It clusters the links between nodes rather than clustering nodes to identify modules. The identified modules are allowed to have same nodes, consequently uncovering the overlapping and dense community of a biological network. MCODE identifies densely connected modules based on vertex weighting (local neighbourhood density) and outward traversal (from a locally dense seed node to isolate the dense regions) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p>

      <title>Validation and analysis</title>
      <p id="Par73">Since the ground truth of miRNA sponge interactions is still limited, it is hard to validate predicted miRNA sponge interactions generated by computational methods. In <italic>miRspongeR</italic>, we provide the <italic>spongeValidate</italic> function to validate predicted miRNA sponge interactions by using curated miRNA sponge interactions as a source. As for the predicted miRNA sponge interactions that are not included in the source for validation, users need further wet lab experiments to know if the predictions are correct or not. The ground truth of miRNA sponge interactions is from miRSponge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], LncCeRBase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], LncACTdb v2.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and the three manually curated literatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. We include the ground truth as a file in the package, and will continually update it for accurately evaluating and comparing different methods. Users can also use their own ground truth or wet lab experiments to validate predicted results.</p>
      <p id="Par74">Furthermore, to understand potential diseases, biological processes and pathways associated with miRNA sponge modules, we provide two functions, <italic>moduleDEA</italic> and <italic>moduleFEA</italic> for functional enrichment analysis. Firstly, we implement the <italic>moduleDEA</italic> function to make disease enrichment analysis of miRNA sponge modules. The disease databases used include Disease Ontology database (DO, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://disease-ontology.org/">http://disease-ontology.org/</ext-link>), DisGeNET database (DGN, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.disgenet.org/">http://www.disgenet.org/</ext-link>) and Network of Cancer Genes database (NCG, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ncg.kcl.ac.uk/">http://ncg.kcl.ac.uk/</ext-link>). Moreover, the <italic>moduleFEA</italic> function is implemented to conduct functional GO, KEGG and Reactome enrichment analysis of miRNA sponge modules. The ontology databases used are Gene Ontology database (GO, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneontology.org/">http://www.geneontology.org/</ext-link>), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway Database (KEGG, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg/">http://www.genome.jp/kegg/</ext-link>), and Reactome Pathway Database (Reactome, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://reactome.org/">http://reactome.org/</ext-link>).</p>
      <p id="Par75">Since the survival analysis can indicate whether the miRNA sponges in the discovered miRNA sponge modules are good predictors of the metastasis risks of cancer patients or not, it can provide us the clue that the miRNA sponges may be associated with and potentially contributing to the metastasis or survival of cancer patients. In <italic>miRspongeR</italic>, we implement the <italic>moduleSurvival</italic> function to perform the survival analysis. A multivariate Cox model is used to calculate the risk score of a sample. All the samples are divided into the high risk and the low risk groups according to their risk scores, and the Log-rank test is used to test for the difference between groups. The Hazard Ratio (HR) between the high and the low risk groups is also calculated.</p>

      <title>Application</title>
      <p id="Par76">In this section, we apply the <italic>miRspongeR</italic> package to the BRCA dataset. The matched Level 3 IlluminaHiSeq miRNA and mRNA expression data of human breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) is obtained from Paci et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The gene-level expression values are in Fragments Per Kilobase Million (FPKM) units. Paci et al. obtained the expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cancergenome.nih.gov/">https://cancergenome.nih.gov/</ext-link>), and restricted the data to 72 individuals where the tumor and normal tissues were from the same BRCA patients. A miRNA or mRNA with missing values in more than 10% of the samples is removed. The remaining missing values are imputed using the <italic>k</italic>-nearest neighbours (KNN) algorithm in the <italic>impute</italic> R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. We use the <italic>limma</italic> R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] to infer differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs between tumour and normal samples. After the analysis, we identify 161 miRNAs and 5370 mRNAs which are differentially expressed at a significant level (adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;1E-04, adjusted by Benjamini &amp; Hochberg method). The survival data of the 72 BRCA tumour samples is obtained from TCGA.</p>
      <p id="Par77">To obtain high-quality candidate miRNA sponge interaction pairs, we use experimentally validated miRNA-target interactions from miRTarBase v7.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] for the case study. We are only interested in the miRNA-target interactions supported by strong experimental evidences (Reporter assay or Western blot) in miRTarBase. Between 161 miRNAs and 5370 mRNAs which are differentially expressed, we obtain 1251 unique miRNA-target interactions from miRTarBase. The MREs information is obtained from Sardina et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. They employ miRanda algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] to predict binding sites, and MREs have the hybridization energy values no more than 0 are reserved. In total, we have a list of 824,828 MREs related to the differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs. By using the default ground truth in the <italic>miRspongeR</italic> package, we have a list of 1465 unique validated miRNA sponge interactions in total.</p>
      <p id="Par78">For the identification of miRNA sponge interactions, the cutoffs to be set by users are recommended as follows: 0.05 for the significant <italic>p</italic>-value cutoff of the shared miRNAs, 0.05 for the <italic>p</italic>-value cutoff of significant positive correlations for the <italic>pc</italic> method, and 0.1 for the <italic>sensitivity correlation</italic> cutoff for the <italic>sppc</italic> method. A higher value of the <italic>sensitivity correlation</italic> cutoff will generate a smaller number of miRNA sponge interactions. As for the <italic>hermes</italic> and <italic>ppc</italic> methods, we suggest use 0.05 as the statistical significance <italic>p</italic>-value cutoff of evaluating Δ<italic>I</italic> and Δ<italic>C</italic>. All the <italic>p</italic>-values above are adjusted by the Benjamini &amp; Hochberg method, and a smaller <italic>p</italic>-value cutoff will identify a smaller number of miRNA sponge interactions. The number of permutations for both the <italic>hermes</italic> and <italic>ppc</italic> methods has been set to 100 by default in the package. The cutoff of normalized score is set to 0.5 by default in the package for the <italic>muTaME</italic> and <italic>cernia</italic> methods. For the <italic>integrateMethod</italic> method, we only retain the predicted miRNA sponge interactions which are predicted by at least 3 out of the 7 component methods.</p>
      <p id="Par79">For the identification miRNA sponge modules in the BRCA dataset, the module size cutoff for the FN, MCL, LINKCOMM and MCODE methods is set to 3 by default in the package.

The reason is that the <italic>miRHomology</italic> method only uses a commonly used constraint (significant sharing of common miRNAs) to identify miRNA sponge interactions. By using the <italic>integrateMethod</italic> method, we obtain a list of 87 high-confidence miRNA sponge interactions. The detailed information of predicted miRNA sponge interactions by the methods can be seen in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>UpSet plot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] to show the intersections between predicted miRNA sponge interactions by the 7 built-in individual methods.

The intersection size between different methods represents exclusive intersections, i.e. the intersection set not in a subset of any other intersection set</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12859_2019_2861_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par84">To investigate the overlap of any 2 of 7 individual methods, we further use the Venn diagrams to show pair-wise comparison of overlapping results for the 7 individual methods.

      <p id="Par85">Furthermore, we use the ground truth to validate the predicted miRNA sponge interactions. As a result, for all the methods only 1 miRNA sponge interaction, (PTEN:ZEB1, where “:” denotes competing relationship), is validated by the ground truth. In terms of the number of experimentally validated miRNA sponge interactions, these methods perform the same. However, in terms of the percentage of experimentally validated miRNA sponge interactions, the <italic>sppc</italic> method performs the best.</p>

      <title>Module identification from BRCA-related miRNA sponge interaction network</title>

As shown in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, the four module identification methods (FN, MCL, LINKCOMM and MCODE) obtain different results of the identified miRNA sponge modules.

      <title>Enrichment and survival analysis of BRCA-related miRNA sponge modules</title>
      <p id="Par87">In this section, we conduct enrichment and survival analysis of the identified BRCA-related miRNA sponge modules described in the previous section. Here, if a term (DO, DGN, NCG, GO, KEGG or Reactome term) is enriched in a miRNA sponge module with adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05 (adjusted by Benjamini &amp; Hochberg method), the term is a significantly enriched term. If a miRNA sponge module can distinguish the high and the low risk tumor samples (Log-rank <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05, HR &gt; 1.5), the miRNA sponge module is regarded as a significant miRNA sponge module.</p>
      <p id="Par88">The overall number of significantly enriched terms can be seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Overall, the identified modules by the LINKCOMM method have the largest number of significantly enriched DGN, GO and Reactome terms. The identified modules by MCODE have the largest number of significantly enriched DO and NCG terms. The modules identified by the FN method have the largest number of significantly enriched KEGG terms. For each method, the number of significantly enriched terms in each module can be seen in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>. Due to a lack of comprehensive knowledge of enriched terms indirectly and directly associated with BRCA, we use all significantly enriched terms (DO, DGN, NCG, GO, KEGG and Reactome terms) associated with the miRNA sponge modules. It is noted that users can further investigate these significantly enriched terms in the context of BRCA.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Overall number of significantly enriched terms in BRCA-related miRNA sponge modules using FN, MCL, LINKCOMM and MCODE.

    <p id="Par91">The putative miRNA-target interactions are crucial for the identification of miRNA sponge interaction. The miRNA-target identification methods, such as miRanda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], TargetScan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and DIANA-microT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], predict many false positives and the number of miRNA target genes is largely overestimated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], affecting the accuracy of the candidate miRNA sponge interaction pairs. Therefore, instead of predicted miRNA-target interactions, we use experimentally validated miRNA-target interactions in the case study. The experimentally validated miRNA-target interactions can be used to provide high-quality candidate miRNA sponge interaction pairs. According to the practical situation, users can also use their own predicted miRNA-target interactions to obtain candidate miRNA sponge interaction pairs.</p>
    <p id="Par92">Moreover, the number of candidate miRNA sponges is closely associated with the putative miRNA-target interactions used. In the case study, we only use the miRNA-target interactions supported by strong experimental evidences (Reporter assay or Western blot) in miRTarBase. The maximum number of miRNA sponges expected to be identified depends on the number of targets in the putative miRNA-target interactions. However, experimentally validated miRNA-target interactions are far from complete. A possible solution is to integrate multiple experimentally validated datasets, such as miRTarBase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], TarBase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and miRWalk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], to obtain a more comprehensive list of putative miRNA-target interactions.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p id="Par93">Recently, miRNA sponges have been demonstrated to play important roles in human cancers by modulating the expression of key oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes. Since biological experiments generate a large amount of data associated with miRNA sponges, this creates a strong demand for data analysis in statistics computing environments such as R. In this paper, we introduce an R/Bioconductor package that enables R users to use popular computational methods for the identification and analysis of miRNA sponge interaction networks and modules. As the research into miRNA sponges is just emerging, we will continuously include new methods in the package in the future. We believe that <italic>miRspongeR</italic> will be a useful tool for the research of miRNA sponges.</p>
