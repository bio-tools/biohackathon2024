        <p>Manual modeling of complicated insect wings presents considerable practical challenges. To overcome these challenges, therefore, we developed <italic>WingMesh</italic>. This is an application for simple yet precise automatic modeling of insect wings. Using a series of examples, we showed the performance of our application in practice.

        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>The finite element (FE) method is one of the most widely used numerical techniques for the simulation of the mechanical behavior of engineering and biological objects. Although very efficient, the use of the FE method relies on the development of accurate models of the objects under consideration. The development of detailed FE models of often complex-shaped objects, however, can be a time-consuming and error-prone procedure in practice. Hence, many researchers aim to reach a compromise between the simplicity and accuracy of their developed models. In this study, we adapted <italic>Distmesh2D</italic>, a popular meshing tool, to develop a powerful application for the modeling of geometrically complex objects, such as insect wings. The use of the burning algorithm (BA) in digital image processing (DIP) enabled our method to automatically detect an arbitrary domain and its subdomains in a given image. This algorithm, in combination with the mesh generator <italic>Distmesh2D</italic>, was used to develop detailed FE models of both planar and out-of-plane (i.e., three-dimensionally corrugated) domains containing discontinuities and consisting of numerous subdomains. To easily implement the method, we developed an application using the Matlab App Designer. This application, called <italic>WingMesh</italic>, was particularly designed and applied for rapid numerical modeling of complicated insect wings but is also applicable for modeling purposes in the earth, engineering, mathematical, and physical sciences.</p>

    <title>1. Introduction</title>
    <p>The finite element (FE) method is a numerical technique which is generally used to simulate a physical phenomenon in the virtual world by solving complex boundary value problems [<xref rid="B1-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. FE software packages were developed to simplify often complicated simulation processes. They are especially very common in engineering applications [<xref rid="B3-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and are becoming increasingly popular in the investigation of the mechanical behavior of biological structures, such as complex human and animal body parts [<xref rid="B6-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
    <p>Although providing a user with a high degree of flexibility, all available FE packages have a common need: an accurate model. A model is a domain which is subdivided into smaller polygonal or polyhedral meshes, so-called elements [<xref rid="B14-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A modeling process, however, may present many challenges and can be rather time-consuming, especially when dealing with complex geometries [<xref rid="B15-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which is usually the case in biology. The skills of the software user can also strongly influence the process and the final result. These often lead to oversimplified models and, therefore, can affect the accuracy of simulation results. How can this problem be overcome?</p>
    <p>In 2004, Persson and Strang aimed to address this problem by developing a simple meshing technique called <italic>Distmesh2D</italic> [<xref rid="B18-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. As intended by its developers, the method, which was implemented in Matlab code, provided an effective tool to mesh a given domain automatically. The simplicity of the method and the high quality of the produced mesh are the key advantages of the proposed method. However, it also has a major drawback: finding the distance to boundaries by the use of the mathematical equation <italic>f</italic>(<italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>) = 0 or by values of a discrete set of points, as explained by the authors, is a time-consuming and error-prone procedure for complex geometries. Due to the use of a mathematical scheme to define the distance function (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot5-insects-11-00546">Section 2.5</xref>), <italic>Distmesh2D</italic> also has limitations when meshing a domain containing discontinuities.</p>
    <p>Here, we aimed to address these challenges and improve the performance of <italic>Distmesh2D</italic> but still maintain its simplicity. To this end, we used computer vision to automatically detect the boundary of a domain in a given image. We combined it with the mesh generator <italic>Distmesh2D</italic> to develop an application for the rapid modeling of geometrically complex domains that consist of several subdomains. The applicability of the method is not limited to in-plane domains, but it can also mesh out-of-plane (i.e., corrugated) objects. We specifically designed and used our method to develop models of insect wings. The proposed application, called <italic>WingMesh</italic>, draws extensively on Persson and Strang’s account in an attempt to offer a simple, but more practical, meshing tool.</p>

    <title>2. Materials and Methods</title>
    <p>The modeling method presented in this study, called <italic>WingMesh</italic>, consists of several algorithms that interact with each other. The method requires an input image to identify the boundaries of a given domain as well as subdomains within that. The code <italic>Distmesh2D</italic> is then employed to mesh the identified domain. Other algorithms were added to the main algorithms to model out-of-plane domains and create a *<italic>.inp</italic> file, which is the Abaqus input file format [<xref rid="B19-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The key parts of the developed Matlab code and the full code of the method, together with a graphical user interface (GUI) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-insects-11-00546">Section 3</xref>), are accessible in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-insects-11-00546">Supplementary Materials (Codes S1 and S3, Method S1)</xref>.</p>
    <sec id="sec2dot1-insects-11-00546">
      <title>2.1. Burning Algorithm for Detection of the Boundary of a Given Domain</title>
      <p>The burning algorithm (BA) was used to extract the boundary of a domain in a given image [<xref rid="B20-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The BA needs a digital black and white image as the input, in which black pixels, with the pixel value of 0, represent the border of the domain and white pixels, with the pixel value of 1, represent regions that are situated inside and outside of the domain. The BA uses the matrix of the input image to detect the boundary of the domain in that image. This process starts with choosing a pixel within the domain by the user (Pixel 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00546-f001">Figure 1</xref>a) and continues by detecting white pixels around the selected pixel. To this end, the algorithm checks the colors of pixels located in the four orthogonal directions of the selected white pixels (Pixels 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00546-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). The coordinates of the found black pixels are stored in a matrix, and the colors of detected white and black pixels are changed to 0.8 (light grey) and 0.1 (dark grey), respectively, in order to avoid their reselection in the next iteration. This process continues by searching for white and black pixels around only white pixels detected in the previous iteration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00546-f001">Figure 1</xref>c–m). This process continues until all white pixels inside the domain are detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00546-f001">Figure 1</xref>m). <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-insects-11-00546">Code S2 and Video S1 in the Supplementary Materials</xref> are the source code of BA and a simple illustration of how it works, respectively.</p>

    <sec id="sec2dot2-insects-11-00546">
      <title>2.2. Detection of Subdomains within a Given Domain</title>
      <p>The function BA can also detect subdomains within a given domain. When the main domain contains any subdomain, the application first finds the white pixels outside the domain. This process eventually results in the detection of the boundary of the domain.</p>
      <p>To find the boundary of each subdomain, the user should select a pixel inside that subdomain in the input image. By this, the BA finds the pixels located on the boundary of the subdomain using the same method explained earlier. This process continues as long as the user selects a pixel in a new subdomain.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2dot3-insects-11-00546">
      <title>2.3. Detection of Discontinuities in a Given Domain</title>
      <p>The function BA can detect any discontinuity, such as holes, cracks, etc., in a given domain. For this purpose, if any discontinuity exists, the user should select a pixel in each discontinuity in the input image (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-insects-11-00546">Video S2</xref>). After this, using the same method as described before, BA finds the boundary of each selected discontinuity. By this, the application detects discontinuities and excludes them from the main domain. To this end, after meshing the structure, the application finds all elements inside the region of discontinuity and excludes them from the model.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2dot4-insects-11-00546">
      <title>2.4. Development of a Corrugated Model</title>
      <p>In a recent study, we developed a method for modeling out-of-plane (i.e., corrugated) domains [<xref rid="B22-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Here, we modified this technique to make it more efficient and easier to implement. This technique requires an additional input image with the same frame size as the main input image. The other image should include information regarding the corrugation of the out-of-plane domain. The information should include the location of the maximum and minimum heights, indicated by the black and white colors, respectively. The value of pixels in the secondary image, therefore, serves as a measure of the height of that pixel: pixel values 0 and 1 indicate the maximum and minim heights, respectively. If there is more than one maximum or minimum height in a domain, any local extremum can be marked in grey color. The intensity of the grey color in each local extremum indicates the relative height of that extremum compared to the absolute extremum.</p>
      <p>The recursive Equation (1) is used to smooth the corrugations to avoid any abrupt change in the height of a model at the location of an extremum.

This equation recursively updates the color intensity of the pixels in the secondary image and, thereby, the height of those pixels in the model. The number of iterations, which is set by the user, controls the sharpness of corrugations in the developed model. The values of pixels in the secondary input image, which are between 0 and 1, represent the relative heights of corrugations.</p>

      <title>2.5. Mesh Generation</title>
      <p><italic>Distmesh2D</italic> is a mesh generator in Matlab which employs a distance function, <italic>d</italic>(<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>), to describe the geometry of a domain [<xref rid="B18-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The Delaunay algorithm is used in <italic>Distmesh2D</italic> to generate triangular meshes. The first line of the code <italic>Distmesh2D</italic>, the calling syntax, represents inputs and outputs of the Matlab code:
<disp-formula><italic>function</italic> [<italic>p,t</italic>] = <italic>distmesh2d</italic>(<italic>fd,fh,h0,bbox,pfix</italic>)</disp-formula>
where the input arguments are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p><italic>fd</italic>, the distance function that defines the boundary of the domain.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>fh</italic>, the distance function, which controls the convergence of the size of elements. The size of the elements decreases near <italic>fh</italic>.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>h0</italic>, the distance between nodes in the initial distribution.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>bbox</italic>, the bounding box in which the domain is located.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>pfix</italic>, defines nodal points, which are set as fixed points while generating elements.</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p><italic>Distmesh2D</italic> produces the following outputs:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p><italic>p</italic>, gives the coordinate of the nodal points.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>t</italic>, indicates the connection between the nodes.</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>Here, coordinates of the nodes on the boundary of a given domain, which are obtained by the BA, are used to define the distance functions <italic>fd</italic> and <italic>fh</italic> for the mesh generator <italic>Distmesh2D</italic>. In addition to the distance functions <italic>fd</italic> and <italic>fh</italic>, <italic>Distmesh2D</italic> has three other inputs: <italic>h0</italic>, <italic>bbox</italic>, and <italic>pfix</italic>. <italic>h0</italic>, the distance between initial nodes, can be set to 1, because the minimum distance between two pixels is 1. <italic>bbox</italic> is equal to the frame size of the imported image (size of the input matrix). The pixels located on the boundaries of the subdomains, extracted by the BA, are defined as fixed points, <italic>pfix</italic>.</p>
      <p><italic>Distmesh2D</italic> can generate both structured and unstructured elements. However, in this study, we set it to create only unstructured elements, because this type of element fits better with our aim for developing models of geometrically complex structures.</p>

    <title>6. Applications</title>
    <p>The application presented in this study can be used for modeling a wide range of objects in both science and engineering, where a planar FE model is required. For example, models developed by our application could be used to understand the mechanical behavior of biological structures, such as insect wings, plant leaves, etc. (see [<xref rid="B25-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] for more examples). In engineering, it can be employed for FE modeling of plate and shell structures used in aircraft, space crafts, ships, pressure vessels, etc. (see [<xref rid="B26-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] for more examples). Our method could also be used in geology and geo-mechanics for the prediction of the mechanical response of complex inhomogeneous rock and concrete structures.</p>
    <p>Although <italic>WingMesh</italic> is a promising first step towards the automatic modeling of insect wings, there still remain some other structural features that can be included in a wing model. A few examples of such features are nodus and vein joints, which play key roles in wing deformations both during flight [<xref rid="B9-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B28-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and at rest (i.e., wing folding [<xref rid="B30-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-insects-11-00546" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]). Hence, as developers of <italic>WingMesh</italic>, we are currently working to develop the next generation of our program, which is able to create wing models with more structural details.</p>
