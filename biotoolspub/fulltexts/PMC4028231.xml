    <abstract>
      <p>Protein-RNA interactions are central to essential cellular processes such as protein synthesis and regulation of gene expression and play roles in human infectious and genetic diseases. Reliable identification of protein-RNA interfaces is critical for understanding the structural bases and functional implications of such interactions and for developing effective approaches to rational drug design. Sequence-based computational methods offer a viable, cost-effective way to identify putative RNA-binding residues in RNA-binding proteins. Here we report two novel approaches: (i) HomPRIP, a sequence homology-based method for predicting RNA-binding sites in proteins; (ii) RNABindRPlus, a new method that combines predictions from HomPRIP with those from an optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained on a benchmark dataset of 198 RNA-binding proteins. Although highly reliable, HomPRIP cannot make predictions for the unaligned parts of query proteins and its coverage is limited by the availability of close sequence homologs of the query protein with experimentally determined RNA-binding sites. RNABindRPlus overcomes these limitations. We compared the performance of HomPRIP and RNABindRPlus with that of several state-of-the-art predictors on two test sets, RB44 and RB111. On a subset of proteins for which homologs with experimentally determined interfaces could be reliably identified, HomPRIP outperformed all other methods achieving an MCC of 0.63 on RB44 and 0.83 on RB111. RNABindRPlus was able to predict RNA-binding residues of all proteins in both test sets, achieving an MCC of 0.55 and 0.37, respectively, and outperforming all other methods, including those that make use of structure-derived features of proteins. More importantly, RNABindRPlus outperforms all other methods for any choice of tradeoff between precision and recall. An important advantage of both HomPRIP and RNABindRPlus is that they rely on readily available sequence and sequence-derived features of RNA-binding proteins. A webserver implementation of both methods is freely available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://einstein.cs.iastate.edu/RNABindRPlus/">http://einstein.cs.iastate.edu/RNABindRPlus/</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Protein-RNA interactions play key roles in many vital cellular processes including translation <xref rid="pone.0097725-GaliciaVazquez1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097725-Standart1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression <xref rid="pone.0097725-Grigull1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097725-Tadros1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, RNA splicing <xref rid="pone.0097725-Blencowe1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097725-Muers1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and viral replication <xref rid="pone.0097725-Denison1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097725-Nagy1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Recent evidence points to the role of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in a number of human diseases <xref rid="pone.0097725-Esteller1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0097725-VanRoosbroeck1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> such as Alzheimer's <xref rid="pone.0097725-Schonrock1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097725-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and various cancers <xref rid="pone.0097725-Huarte1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0097725-Kechavarzi1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Reliable identification of protein-RNA interfaces is critical for understanding the structural bases, the underlying mechanisms, and functional implications of protein-RNA interactions. Such understanding is essential for the success of efforts aimed at identifying novel therapies for genetic and infectious diseases.</p>
    <p>Despite extensive structural genomics efforts, the number of solved protein-RNA structures substantially lags behind the number of possible protein-RNA complexes <xref rid="pone.0097725-Puton1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Because of the cost and effort involved in the experimental determination of protein-RNA complex structures <xref rid="pone.0097725-Ke1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097725-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and RNA-binding sites in proteins <xref rid="pone.0097725-Hellman1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097725-Ule1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, considerable effort has been directed at developing reliable computational methods for predicting RNA-binding residues in proteins.</p>
    <p>Computational approaches to protein-RNA interface prediction fall into two broad categories <xref rid="pone.0097725-Puton1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097725-Walia1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>: (i) Sequence-based methods, which use an encoding of sequence-derived features of a target residue and its neighboring residues in sequence (sequence neighbors) to make predictions, and (ii) Structure-based methods, which use an encoding of structure-derived features of a target residue and its neighboring residues in sequence or structure to make predictions. Sequence-based methods <xref rid="pone.0097725-Carson1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0097725-Wang4" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> have exploited features such as amino acid sequence identity, physicochemical properties of amino acids, predicted solvent accessibility, position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs), and interface propensities, among others. Structure-based methods <xref rid="pone.0097725-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0097725-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> have used features such as amino acid doublet propensities of surface residues, geometry (patches or clefts) of the protein surface, roughness, and atomic protrusion (CX) values, to make predictions of RNA-binding residues in proteins.</p>
    <p>Two recent comprehensive surveys of machine learning methods for predicting interfacial residues in protein-RNA complexes <xref rid="pone.0097725-Puton1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097725-Walia1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> came to a somewhat surprising conclusion that the performance of sequence-based methods, especially those that use PSSMs to encode protein sequences, is comparable to that of structure-based methods, i.e., methods that take advantage of three-dimensional structure of the target protein, when available. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e001.jpg"/></inline-formula> (Matthews Correlation Coefficient) values for the best methods ranged from 0.38 to 0.46. The difference in performance of the best performing methods was relatively small, and in several cases, not statistically significant <xref rid="pone.0097725-Walia1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>
    <p>Homology-based methods have proven successful in many bioinformatics tasks, including protein structure prediction <xref rid="pone.0097725-MartiRenom1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, protein function annotation <xref rid="pone.0097725-Andrade1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097725-Zehetner1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, protein interaction prediction <xref rid="pone.0097725-Matthews1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, protein-protein docking <xref rid="pone.0097725-Mukherjee1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097725-Xue1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> and protein-protein interface prediction, based on either sequence homology <xref rid="pone.0097725-Xue2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> or structure homology <xref rid="pone.0097725-Jordan1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0097725-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Homology-based methods have been shown to outperform other methods whenever close sequence or structural homologs of query proteins (used as templates) can be reliably identified <xref rid="pone.0097725-Xue2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097725-Jordan1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097725-Kauffman1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Based on their analysis of a dataset of 261 protein-RNA complexes, Spriggs and Jones <xref rid="pone.0097725-Spriggs2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> concluded that RNA-binding residues are more conserved than other surface residues in RNA-binding proteins. To the best of our knowledge, however, there have been no studies that have examined the extent to which RNA-binding residues are indeed conserved among homologous proteins, or used sequence homology to reliably predict RNA-binding residues in protein.</p>
    <p>Against this background, we explore whether sequence homology can be used to accurately predict RNA-binding residues in proteins and whether the resulting sequence homology-based approach can be combined with a state-of-the-art machine learning method to enhance the reliability of the predicted RNA-binding residues. Specifically, we: (i) introduce a novel sequence homology-based approach for prediction RNA-binding residues in proteins, HomPRIP, which accurately predicts the RNA-binding residues in a query protein based on the known RNA-binding residues of sequence homologs of the query protein (whenever such homologs are available); and (ii) propose RNABindRPlus, a novel two-stage predictor that uses logistic regression to optimally combine the predictions from HomPRIP and an optimized SVM classifier, SVMOpt, trained to predict RNA-binding interface residues using only sequence derived features of the query protein. We demonstrate that RNABindRPlus substantially outperforms existing sequence-based and structure-based methods. Both HomPRIP and RNABindRPlus have been implemented in a webserver that can be used to reliably predict RNA-binding residues in proteins, even when the structure of the query protein is unavailable.</p>

      <title>Rationale for Homology-Based Approach</title>
      <p>If RNA-binding residues are conserved across homologous proteins, we can use a simple sequence homology-based approach to predict RNA-binding residues in a query protein: Identify close sequence homologs of the query protein; infer the RNA-binding residues of the query protein based on the known RNA-binding residues of homolog(s) that are aligned with the query protein. The greater the extent to which RNA-binding residues are conserved across homologous protein-RNA complexes, the greater is the reliability with which the RNA-binding residues of a query protein can be predicted based on the known RNA-binding residues of its sequence homologs.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s2b">
      <title>Conservation Analysis of RNA-Binding Residues in Protein-RNA Complexes</title>
      <p>Following the approach of Xue et al. <xref rid="pone.0097725-Xue2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, we define an interface conservation score <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e002.jpg"/></inline-formula> that measures the correlation between the interface (and non-interface) residues of a query protein <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e003.jpg"/></inline-formula> and its putative sequence homolog <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e004.jpg"/></inline-formula> when the two are aligned (see Methods for details). The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e005.jpg"/></inline-formula> score measures the degree to which RNA-binding residues of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e006.jpg"/></inline-formula> are conserved in (and hence can be predicted from the known interface residues of) the protein <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e007.jpg"/></inline-formula>. We calculated the pairwise <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e008.jpg"/></inline-formula> scores of proteins in a non-redundant dataset of 216 RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) extracted from the PDB (Protein Data Bank, <xref rid="pone.0097725-Berman1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>) as of October 2010 (NR216, see Methods). Our analysis showed that RNA-binding residues of a protein are highly conserved among its close sequence homologs (data not shown).</p>
      <p>Whenever a query protein has a sufficiently high <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e009.jpg"/></inline-formula> score with respect to its putative sequence homolog, we can predict its RNA-binding residues based on the known RNA-binding residues of its sequence homolog. However, examination of the precise definition of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e010.jpg"/></inline-formula> score of a protein with respect to its putative sequence homolog (see Methods) shows that computing it requires knowledge of the RNA-binding residues of both the query protein and its homolog. How can we then use the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e011.jpg"/></inline-formula> score, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e012.jpg"/></inline-formula>, of a query protein <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e013.jpg"/></inline-formula> with respect to a putative sequence homolog <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e014.jpg"/></inline-formula> to determine whether we can reliably <italic>predict</italic> the <italic>unknown</italic> RNA-binding residues of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e015.jpg"/></inline-formula> based on the <italic>known</italic> RNA-binding residues of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e016.jpg"/></inline-formula>? Fortunately, as shown below, we can estimate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e017.jpg"/></inline-formula> using available information, e.g., the sequence alignment of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e018.jpg"/></inline-formula> with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e019.jpg"/></inline-formula>. Specifically, we construct a regression model to predict the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e020.jpg"/></inline-formula> score for the query protein from its alignment with its sequence homolog(s) with known RNA-binding residues.</p>

      <title>Predicting the Interface Conservation Score of a Query Protein</title>
      <p>We used Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to explore the relationship between six key sequence alignment statistics (see Methods), that are indicative of the quality of the alignment of a protein with its putative sequence homologs, and the IC score of the protein. Our analysis showed that a large fraction (90.6%) of the variance of the IC score is accounted for by the first two principal components. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097725-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows the projection of 6-dimensional alignment statistics of a protein and its sequence homolog(s) onto a 2-dimensional plane defined by the first two principal components. The resulting 2-dimensional interface conservation space can be partitioned into three regions based on the IC score: (i) Dark Zone, which contains query-homolog pairs with low IC scores (blue data points); (ii) Twilight Zone, which contains query-homolog pairs with intermediate IC scores (yellow, orange, and green data points); and (iii) Safe Zone, which contains query-homolog pairs with high IC scores (red data points).</p>

      <title>HomPRIP: A Sequence Homology-Based RNA-Binding Site Predictor</title>
      <p>Now that we have a means of predicting the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e058.jpg"/></inline-formula> score, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e059.jpg"/></inline-formula>, of a query protein <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e060.jpg"/></inline-formula> with respect to its putative sequence homolog <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e061.jpg"/></inline-formula> from the BLAST alignment scores of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e062.jpg"/></inline-formula> with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e063.jpg"/></inline-formula>, we can proceed to use the predicted <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e064.jpg"/></inline-formula> scores to choose homologs of the query protein to be used to infer the unknown RNA-binding residues of the query protein. HomPRIP, our sequence homology-based protein-RNA interface predictor operates as follows: Given a query protein <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e065.jpg"/></inline-formula>, HomPRIP uses a BLAST search against the proteins in the Protein-RNA Interface Database <xref rid="pone.0097725-Lewis1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, PRIDB, to identify a set of sequence homologs of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e066.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e067.jpg"/></inline-formula>, with known RNA-binding residues. Each sequence homolog <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e068.jpg"/></inline-formula> is assigned a weight <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e069.jpg"/></inline-formula>, which is the predicted <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e070.jpg"/></inline-formula> score, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e071.jpg"/></inline-formula>. A weighted nearest neighbor classifier is used to infer the RNA-binding residues of the query protein based on the known interface residues of its closest homologs (see Methods). The reliability of the predicted RNA-binding residues in each case can be estimated based on the predicted <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e072.jpg"/></inline-formula> scores of the homologs used to arrive at the prediction.</p>

      <title>Evaluation of HomPRIP Predictions: Reliability and Coverage</title>
      <p>In previous work, we used RB198, a non-redundant dataset of protein-RNA complexes <xref rid="pone.0097725-Lewis1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref> to assess the performance of alternative approaches to predicting RNA-binding residues in proteins <xref rid="pone.0097725-Walia1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. For the purpose of comparison with previous approaches, we used each of the proteins in the RB198 dataset as a query protein to HomPRIP. HomPRIP searched for putative sequence homologs of the query proteins in RB198 against the nr_RNAprot_s2c database (see Datasets). Homologs that shared greater than 95% sequence similarity with the query proteins were discarded. This ensures that the query protein itself is excluded from being one of the homologs. HomPRIP was able to find at least one Safe, Twilight, or Dark Zone homolog for only 152 out of the 198 proteins in the RB198 dataset. The prediction performance of HomPRIP was evaluated using several standard metrics (see Methods for details). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097725-t002">Table 2</xref>, for 45% of proteins in RB198, HomPRIP was able to find Safe Zone homologs and, as expected, very reliably predict their RNA-binding residues (with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e073.jpg"/></inline-formula> of 0.83, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e074.jpg"/></inline-formula> of 0.87, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e075.jpg"/></inline-formula> of 0.85). For 27% of the proteins, HomPRIP could find only Twilight Zone homologs and for 5%, only Dark Zone homologs. When predictions are based only on Twilight Zone homologs, the performance of HomPRIP drops to an <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e076.jpg"/></inline-formula> of 0.5, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e077.jpg"/></inline-formula> of 0.64, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e078.jpg"/></inline-formula> of 0.49. When predictions are based only on Dark Zone homologs, HomPRIP has an <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e079.jpg"/></inline-formula> of 0.17, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e080.jpg"/></inline-formula> of 0.37, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e081.jpg"/></inline-formula> of 0.12. On the 152 proteins that had at least one homolog (from any zone), HomPRIP was able to predict RNA-binding residues with an <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e082.jpg"/></inline-formula> of 0.69, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e083.jpg"/></inline-formula> of 0.79, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e084.jpg"/></inline-formula> of 0.69, and an <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e085.jpg"/></inline-formula> of 0.73.</p>

      <p>The prediction coverage of any sequence homology-based method for predicting RNA-binding residues of proteins is limited by the availability of homologs with known RNA-binding residues. Thus, HomPRIP fails to predict RNA-binding residues of query proteins that do not have at least one homolog with experimentally determined RNA-binding residues. For this reason, HomPRIP fails to return any predictions for 23% of proteins in the RB198 dataset. In addition, HomPRIP cannot make predictions on parts of a query protein sequence that are not aligned with any of its homologs. On the other hand, predictors trained using machine learning offer 100% coverage, although the increased coverage may come at the expense of the reduced reliability of predictions. To explore whether improved predictions can be obtained by combining a sequence homology-based method with a machine learning method, we developed RNABindRPlus, a hybrid predictor that combines HomPRIP predictions with those from an optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, SVMOpt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097725-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

      <title>Hybrid Method: RNABindRPlus</title>
      <p>A recent study <xref rid="pone.0097725-Walia1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> compared the performance of Naïve Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers trained to predict RNA-binding residues of proteins, from features of a sliding window of 25 amino acid residues centered on the target residue, using three different sequence-based feature representations (amino acid identity, position specific scoring matrices, and smoothed PSSMs <xref rid="pone.0097725-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>). The study concluded that an SVM classifier, SVM-RBF, which used a radial basis function (RBF) kernel and a PSSM profile to encode the target residue and its sequence neighbors, outperformed all other sequence-based RNA-binding site predictors and was competitive with predictors that use structure-derived features. The study used the default parameters (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e086.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e087.jpg"/></inline-formula>) for the RBF kernel. In the current study, we used an optimized version of the SVM classifier, which we refer to as SVMOpt. The SVM classifier utilized by RNABindRPlus has the hyper parameters, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e088.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e089.jpg"/></inline-formula>, as well as the window size optimized (see Methods) for performance on the RB198 dataset. The best combination of parameters was found to be <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e090.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e091.jpg"/></inline-formula> and a window size of 21 (data not shown). To predict whether or not a given amino acid is an RNA-binding residue, RNABindRPlus combines the prediction scores from HomPRIP with SVMOpt using a logistic regression classifier.</p>

      <title>Performance of HomPRIP and RNABindRPlus</title>
      <p>To rigorously compare the performance of HomPRIP and RNABindRPlus with each other and with available state-of-the-art methods (see below), we used two independent test sets:</p>
      <list list-type="bullet">
        <list-item>
          <p> RB44 <xref rid="pone.0097725-Puton1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> (see Datasets), an independent benchmark test set of 44 protein chains extracted from protein-RNA complexes deposited in the PDB between January 2011 and April 2011. The performance of a variety of methods for predicting RNA-binding residues in proteins was benchmarked on this dataset by Puton et al. <xref rid="pone.0097725-Puton1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Note that the datasets RB198 and RB44 share no common members.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>RB111, a more recently generated test set of 111 protein chains extracted from protein-RNA complexes deposited in the PDB between June 2010 to December 2010, and May 2011 to March 2014. Sequences in RB111 share less than 40% sequence similarity with sequences in RB198 and RB44.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>Out of the 44 proteins in the RB44 dataset, HomPRIP was able to make predictions on 28 proteins. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097725-t003">Table 3</xref> compares the performance measures of different methods on these 28 proteins. HomPRIP achieved an <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e092.jpg"/></inline-formula> of 0.63 as compared to RNABindRPlus, which had an <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e093.jpg"/></inline-formula> of 0.60 and the Metapredictor <xref rid="pone.0097725-Puton1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and PiRaNhA <xref rid="pone.0097725-Spriggs1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, both of which had an <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e094.jpg"/></inline-formula> of 0.51. Other sequence- and structure-based methods tested had even lower values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e095.jpg"/></inline-formula>. This result shows that when HomPRIP can identify homologs with known interfaces, it can outperform other methods.</p>

On the subset of 2 proteins that have Dark Zone homologs, RNABindRPlus achieved higher values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e108.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e109.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e110.jpg"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e111.jpg"/></inline-formula> than HomPRIP (0.83, 0.54, 0.65, and 0.57 versus 0.45, 0.18, 0.26, and 0.13, respectively). Thus, although HomPRIP has higher values of performance metrics on query proteins that have Safe Zone homologs, RNABindRPlus has superior performance on query proteins that have homologs in the Twilight and Dark Zones.</p>

      <p>These results confirm that HomPRIP's prediction performance is dependent upon the degree of sequence similarity between the query protein and its putative sequence homologs with known RNA-binding residues. More importantly, it demonstrates that the homology zones are good indicators of the reliability of HomPRIP's predictions. When Safe Zone homologs are available for query proteins, HomPRIP has the highest predictive performance. In contrast, the performance of RNABindRPlus is similar across proteins from different homology zones, although it is slightly lower than that of HomPRIP on query proteins in the Safe Zone.</p>

      <title>What Factors Lead to Superior Performance for RNABindRPlus?</title>
      <p>As noted by Walia et al. <xref rid="pone.0097725-Walia1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, predictors that use PSSMs outperform those that use amino acid identity when evaluated using a standardized experimental setup (same datasets, same cross-validation procedure). Each score in a PSSM is a log-likelihood ratio of an amino acids appearance in a specific column of a multiple sequence alignment against a background distribution, representing the degree of conservation of the amino acid in that specific position; the higher the score, the higher the degree of conservation. Therefore, PSSMs capture important evolutionary information by exploiting the large number of available protein sequences, which are much easier to obtain than protein structures.</p>
      <p>RNABindRPlus combines our homology-based method, HomPRIP, with SVMOpt, an optimized SVM classifier that uses a radial basis function (RBF) kernel with the sequence PSSM features. We believe that RNABindRPlus achieves a superior performance because it benefits from (i) the interface conservation information contributed by HomPRIP; (ii) residue conservation information encoded in PSSMs; and (iii) the hidden interaction patterns extracted by SVMOpt from the training set.</p>

      <title>Case Study: Accurate Identification of RNA-Binding Residues in the Human Immunorecognition Protein, RIG-I</title>
      <p>RNA-protein interactions play key roles in the innate immune system in mammals, which is the first line of defense against invading viral and bacterial pathogens <xref rid="pone.0097725-Iwasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. One class of cytosolic RNA-binding proteins, the RIG-I-Like receptors (RLRs), function as RNA sensors that can identify viral RNA as non-self by binding to specific molecular motifs in viral RNAs and activating cellular signaling pathways that stimulate host antiviral immune responses and suppress viral replication <xref rid="pone.0097725-Leung1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. The crystal structure of the RIG-I C-terminal domain (CTD) bound to 5′pp dsRNA has been published <xref rid="pone.0097725-Wang5" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, but was not included in the RB44 or RB198 benchmark datasets.</p>
      <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097725-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows the predictions of HomPRIP, SVMOpt, and RNABindRPlus on the RIG-I CTD (PDB Id: 3NCU, chain A). All of the homologs used by HomPRIP for making the prediction were in the Safe Zone. This example illustrates how RNABindRPlus combines the predictions from HomPRIP and SVMOpt to provide better overall predictions. RNABindRPlus returns the lowest number of false positive predictions and has the highest <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e120.jpg"/></inline-formula> (0.75), compared to HomPRIP (0.73) and SVMOpt (0.39). RNABindRPlus also has the highest <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e121.jpg"/></inline-formula> of 0.81 compared to HomPRIP (0.68) and SVMOpt (0.36) whereas HomPRIP has the highest <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e122.jpg"/></inline-formula> of 0.88 compared to RNABindRPlus (0.76) and SVMOpt (0.71). For many biological applications, high <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e123.jpg"/></inline-formula> is desirable, because it allows researchers to identify a short list of residues for targeted mutations designed to alter the affinity or specificity of RNA-binding. As with most classifiers, RNABindRPlus can be tuned to favor even higher specificity, at the expense of lower sensitivity.</p>

      <title>RNABindRPlus Outperforms Other Predictors of RNA-binding Residues</title>
      <p>On the RB44 dataset, we compared the performance of RNABindRPlus with eight sequence-based methods (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097725-t008">Table 8</xref> for method descriptions) and three structure-based methods (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097725-t009">Table 9</xref> for method descriptions). These methods were chosen based on a recent study <xref rid="pone.0097725-Puton1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> of the performance of readily available sequence- and structure-based predictors of RNA-binding sites in proteins. The Puton et al. study used webservers implementing these methods and concluded that the top performing sequence-based methods were a Metapredictor (which combines predictions from PiRaNhA, BindN+, and PPRInt), PiRaNhA <xref rid="pone.0097725-Murakami1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, and BindN+ <xref rid="pone.0097725-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The top performing structure-based methods were KYG <xref rid="pone.0097725-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and DRNA <xref rid="pone.0097725-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In our comparisons, we used the predictions returned by the same webservers (data shared with us by the Bujnicki group) with one exception. We did not compare our methods with the structure-based version of DRNA because the DRNA webserver uses structural homologs that may be exactly the same as the query protein, which could give the DRNA webserver an unfair advantage over other methods. DRNA can predict i) whether or not a protein is RNA-binding, and ii) which amino acids are RNA-binding. In the Puton et al. study, if a protein was predicted as non-RNA binding by DRNA, the case was considered to be one for which DRNA did not predict any RNA-binding residues <xref rid="pone.0097725-Puton1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, in our experiments, we considered only the prediction of the RNA-binding residues, regardless of whether or not a protein was predicted to bind RNA. In addition, we included comparisons with another structure-based method, PRIP <xref rid="pone.0097725-Maetschke1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p>

      <p>On the RB111 dataset, we compared the performance of RNABindRPlus with four sequence-based methods (BindN <xref rid="pone.0097725-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, BindN+ <xref rid="pone.0097725-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, PPRInt <xref rid="pone.0097725-Kumar1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, and RNABindR v2.0 <xref rid="pone.0097725-Walia1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>) and two structure-based methods (KYG <xref rid="pone.0097725-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and PRIP <xref rid="pone.0097725-Maetschke1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>). The Metapredictor <xref rid="pone.0097725-Puton1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, PiRaNhA <xref rid="pone.0097725-Murakami1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, and NAPS <xref rid="pone.0097725-Carson1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> servers were all inaccessible at the time of running the experiments on RB111.</p>
      <p>Because several methods return only binary predictions, we do not report Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) values, but instead compare the different methods based on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e124.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e125.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e126.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e127.jpg"/></inline-formula>.</p>
      <p>The performance of different methods on the RB44 dataset is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097725-t010">Table 10</xref>. Among all methods that return predictions for every query protein in the dataset (i.e., excluding HomPRIP), RNABindRPlus achieved the highest <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e128.jpg"/></inline-formula> value of 0.55. The next highest <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e129.jpg"/></inline-formula> of 0.48 was obtained by PiRaNhA <xref rid="pone.0097725-Murakami1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, and then by SVMOpt and the Metapredictor <xref rid="pone.0097725-Puton1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, both with an <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e130.jpg"/></inline-formula> of 0.47. Notably, in terms of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e131.jpg"/></inline-formula>, the best performing structure-based method was KYG <xref rid="pone.0097725-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> with a value of 0.42, considerably lower than the top sequence-based methods. The highest <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e132.jpg"/></inline-formula> was obtained by the Metapredictor (0.74) followed by RNABindRPlus (0.72). The highest <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e133.jpg"/></inline-formula> was obtained by BindN+ (0.73) <xref rid="pone.0097725-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> followed by SVMOpt and PPRInt <xref rid="pone.0097725-Kumar1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> (0.72). RNABindRPlus had the highest <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e134.jpg"/></inline-formula> value of 0.67. A comparison of the ROC curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097725-g004">Fig. 4a</xref>) shows that the performance of RNABindRPlus (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e135.jpg"/></inline-formula> = 0.86) is superior to that of SVMOpt and the Metapredictor (both have an <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e136.jpg"/></inline-formula> = 0.82). Similarly, the Precision-Recall (PR) curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097725-g004">Fig. 4b</xref>) show that RNABindRPlus achieves a higher precision at all levels of recall than the other two methods.</p>

      <p>Interestingly, the performance of all methods is better on the RB44 dataset than on the RB111 dataset. One possible explanation for this is that RB44 is composed mostly of ribosomal protein chains (36/44), whose roles are structural rather than enzymatic. In contrast, RB111 contains a much smaller proportion of ribosomal protein chains (10/111) and many more enzymes, including CRISPR nucleases, RNA helicases, and RNA methylases. This suggests that training custom classifiers on specific functional or structural classes of RNA-binding proteins could provide improved performance.</p>
      <p>Taken together, these results demonstrate that the hybrid sequence-based method, RNABindRPlus, has substantially higher <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e144.jpg"/></inline-formula> values than other methods evaluated here. Moreover, RNABindRPlus outperforms all other methods at any level of precision and recall. An unexpected result is that the top sequence-based methods, e.g., RNABindRPlus, BindN+, and SVMOpt, all have much higher <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e145.jpg"/></inline-formula> values than any of the structure-based methods.</p>

          <p>NR216: We constructed a maximal non-redundant dataset of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) using the following steps.

Out of this redundant set of protein chains, we obtained 242 non-redundant protein chains using PISCES <xref rid="pone.0097725-Wang6" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref> with the following criteria: (i) sequence identity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e148.jpg"/></inline-formula>; (ii) resolution of 3.5 Å or better; (iii) sequence length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e149.jpg"/></inline-formula> amino acids; (iv) non-X-ray entries were excluded; (v) CA-only entries were excluded. Further, we removed chains with interfaces containing fewer than 5 residues. An amino acid residue is considered an interface residue if it contains at least one heavy atom within 5 Å of any atom in the bound RNA. This definition of interface residues is used throughout this paper. The final dataset contained 216 non-redundant RBP chains with 8,420 interface residues and 48,129 non-interface residues (those residues that do not appear in the 3D structure of a complex are not counted, since we cannot determine if they are interface or not).

RB198 is identical to RB199 except that one chain (2RFK_C) was omitted because it does not contain any interface residues based on the definition provided above. To maintain consistency with previous studies, both RB198 and RB199 include another chain (3EX7_A) which has no interface residues and one chain with only 2 interface residues (2J01_4). In this dataset, we consider residues that are not solved in the structure as non-interface residues. We used this dataset for cross-validation experiments and for training the final machine learning classifiers.</p>

      <title>Sequence Conservation Analysis</title>
      <p>We analyzed interface residues in structural homologs of each protein in a non-redundant dataset of 216 RNA-binding proteins, NR216. We extracted homologs for each of the 216 proteins from the nr_RNAprot_s2c database using BLASTP with an <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e158.jpg"/></inline-formula>
<italic>-value</italic>
<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e159.jpg"/></inline-formula>. The structures and interface residues for proteins in NR216 and their homologs from nr_RNAprot_s2c were experimentally determined. From the resulting set of homologs, sequences that are likely to be copies of the query sequence and hence likely to introduce an undesirable bias in the estimation of sequence conservation were eliminated to obtain a dataset of 8,970 query/homolog pairs. For each query-homolog pair, (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e160.jpg"/></inline-formula>), we calculated the interface conservation score, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e161.jpg"/></inline-formula>, which is a measure of the degree of conservation of interface residues between the query protein, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e162.jpg"/></inline-formula> and its homolog(s), <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e163.jpg"/></inline-formula>. The higher the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e164.jpg"/></inline-formula> score, the more conserved are the interface residues between homologs and the query protein.</p>
      <p>We studied the functional relationship of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e165.jpg"/></inline-formula> score with six alignment statistics, four of which are returned by BLAST <xref rid="pone.0097725-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref> and two of which are derived from BLAST statistics: (i) <italic>Positive score</italic> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e166.jpg"/></inline-formula>), (ii) <italic>Identity score</italic> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e167.jpg"/></inline-formula>), (iii) <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e168.jpg"/></inline-formula>
<italic>-value</italic> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e169.jpg"/></inline-formula>), (iv) <italic>Local Alignment Length</italic> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e170.jpg"/></inline-formula>), (v) <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e171.jpg"/></inline-formula> and (vi) <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e172.jpg"/></inline-formula> (where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e173.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e174.jpg"/></inline-formula> are lengths of the query protein <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e175.jpg"/></inline-formula> and its homolog <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e176.jpg"/></inline-formula>, respectively). The last two measures tell us the extent of sequence homology between a query sequence, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e177.jpg"/></inline-formula> and its homolog, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e178.jpg"/></inline-formula>. The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e179.jpg"/></inline-formula>-value is the expected number of random hits when a query sequence is searched against a database of a particular size. The smaller the E-value, the greater the chance that a hit is a biologically relevant homolog. <italic>Identity score</italic> measures the sequence identity shared by two amino acid sequences. BLASTP also returns a <italic>Positive score</italic> for a specific position, which calculates the observed substitutions that preserve the physicochemical properties of the original residue. A substitution of one residue type for another is labeled positive when the corresponding entry in the scoring matrix has a positive score. We represented each query-homolog alignment pair as a data point in a six-dimensional space defined by the six alignment statistics.</p>
      <p>We used Principal Components Analysis (PCA), a dimensionality reduction technique, to visualize the relationship between the six sequence alignment statistics and the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e180.jpg"/></inline-formula> score. We also constructed a regression model to quantitatively describe interface conservation as a function of sequence alignment statistics.</p>

      <title>HomPRIP: A Sequence Homology-Based RNA-Binding Site Predictor</title>
      <p>Given a query protein sequence, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e181.jpg"/></inline-formula>, HomPRIP searches the nr_RNAprot_s2c database to identify homologous sequences that correspond to the protein components of experimentally determined protein-RNA complexes. The query protein itself is not utilized as one of the homologs. If at least one Safe Zone homolog is found, HomPRIP uses it to predict the interface residues of the query protein, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e182.jpg"/></inline-formula>. Otherwise, the search is repeated for homologs in the Twilight and Dark zones. HomPRIP reports the homology zones (Safe, Twilight, or Dark, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097725-t012">Table 12</xref>) accordingly, and uses the zone as an indicator of prediction confidence. Homologs that share <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e183.jpg"/></inline-formula> sequence identity with the query protein are discarded. This ensures conservative performance estimates for the method. If HomPRIP cannot find homologs in any of the three zones, it does not return any predictions for the query protein.</p>

      <p>HomPRIP assigns a prediction score to each residue of the query protein sequence based on the label of the residue in the corresponding position in its homolog(s) (after pairwise sequence alignment). Specifically, the prediction score (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e185.jpg"/></inline-formula>) for the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e186.jpg"/></inline-formula> residue of the query protein is calculated as: <disp-formula id="pone.0097725.e187"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e187.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e188.jpg"/></inline-formula> is the length of the query protein, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e189.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e190.jpg"/></inline-formula> is the number of close homologs. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e191.jpg"/></inline-formula> is the vote of a homolog <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e192.jpg"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e193.jpg"/></inline-formula>) for the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e194.jpg"/></inline-formula> position of the alignment and is equal to 1 if the corresponding residue in the homolog is an interface residue and 0 otherwise. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e195.jpg"/></inline-formula> is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e196.jpg"/></inline-formula>, the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e197.jpg"/></inline-formula> score predicted by the regression model for the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e198.jpg"/></inline-formula> homolog of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e199.jpg"/></inline-formula>.

      <p>From the Walia et al. <xref rid="pone.0097725-Walia1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> study, we picked the best performing feature, PSSMs, and the best classifier, SVM-RBF (SVM with the RBF kernel), and optimized the cost parameter C and the RBF kernel parameter, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e202.jpg"/></inline-formula>, as well as the window sizes. We tuned these parameters using a three-dimensional grid search over the range <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e203.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e204.jpg"/></inline-formula> and window sizes ranging from 15 to 27.

Specifically, the optimization process was as follows: (i) Pick values for C, gamma, and the window size, (ii) Train the model using the training set, (iii) Evaluate the performance of the model on the validation set, (iv) Repeat steps (i)–(iii) using different training parameters, (v) Select the best model (parameter values) and train it using all the data from the training and validation sets, and (vi) Assess the final model using the held-out test set. Sequence-based 5-fold cross-validation was used in the optimization experiments, so steps (ii) and (iii) were repeated for each fold. We call the optimized classifier SVMOpt. The PSSMs were constructed by running PSI-BLAST <xref rid="pone.0097725-Altschul1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref> against the NCBI nr database for three iterations with an <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e207.jpg"/></inline-formula>-value cutoff of 0.001 for inclusion in the next iteration.</p>

The input to the logistic regression model is a 2D vector representing the prediction scores from HomPRIP and SVMOpt. In cases where HomPRIP failed to return predictions (i.e., no homologs for query proteins are found or the target residue is not aligned with any residues in the homolog(s)), a missing input value (represented as ‘?’) is fed to the logistic regression model. We refer to this hybrid model as RNABindRPlus.</p>

      <title>Performance Evaluation</title>
      <p>We used several different measures of classifier performance. On the RB198 dataset, performance measures were obtained by carrying out sequence-based 5-fold cross-validation. Sequence-based 5-fold cross-validation randomly divides protein chains in RB198 into 5 sets and alternatively uses 4 sets as the training set and 1 set as the test set. The average performance on the 5 test sets is used as the final evaluation of the classifier. Sequence-based cross-validation has been shown to be more rigorous than window-based cross-validation <xref rid="pone.0097725-Caragea1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, because it ensures disjoint training and test sets at the sequence level instead of at the residue level. The predicted label for each residue is compared to the actual label and the residue is classified as a true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative (TN), or false negative (FN). We report the performance measures as defined in Baldi et al. <xref rid="pone.0097725-Baldi1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Overall performance measures are calculated as follows: <disp-formula id="pone.0097725.e209"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e209.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>

</p>
      <p>The measures describe different aspects of classifier performance. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e213.jpg"/></inline-formula> is the probability of correctly predicting the interface residues of a given protein. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e214.jpg"/></inline-formula> is the probability that a predicted interface residue in any given protein is in fact an interface residue. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e215.jpg"/></inline-formula> is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, where the best score is 1 and the worst score is 0. The <italic>Matthews correlation coefficient</italic> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e216.jpg"/></inline-formula>) measures how predictions correlate with true interface and non-interfaces. All machine learning methods have an inherent trade-off between specificity and sensitivity that is controlled through the classification threshold. Predictors that make no positive predictions trivially achieve a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e217.jpg"/></inline-formula> of 1. However, such methods are not useful, because they do not return any true positive predictions.</p>
      <p>A <italic>Receiver Operating Characteristic</italic> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e218.jpg"/></inline-formula>) curve is useful for comparing classifiers across all classification thresholds. Where possible, we show the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e219.jpg"/></inline-formula> curve and report <italic>Area under the ROC curve</italic> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e220.jpg"/></inline-formula>). The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e221.jpg"/></inline-formula> curve plots the proportion of correctly classified positive examples, <italic>True Positive Rate</italic> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e222.jpg"/></inline-formula>), as a function of the proportion of incorrectly classified negative examples, <italic>False Positive Rate</italic> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e223.jpg"/></inline-formula>), for different classification thresholds. When comparing the performance of two classifiers, for the same <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e224.jpg"/></inline-formula>, the one with a higher <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e225.jpg"/></inline-formula> performs better. The ROCR package <xref rid="pone.0097725-Sing1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref> in R was used to generate all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e226.jpg"/></inline-formula> curves and <italic>Precision-Recall</italic> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e227.jpg"/></inline-formula>) curves. When data are unbalanced (fewer interface residues than non-interface residues) <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e228.jpg"/></inline-formula> curves give a more informative picture of an algorithm's performance than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e229.jpg"/></inline-formula> curves. In <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e230.jpg"/></inline-formula> curves, we plot precision as a function of recall, with respect to different prediction score cutoffs. We also report the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e231.jpg"/></inline-formula> value, which is the probability that a classifier gives a higher score to a positive instance than to a negative instance. An <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e232.jpg"/></inline-formula> of 0.5 indicates a random discrimination between the positive and negative class while an <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0097725.e233.jpg"/></inline-formula> of 1.0 indicates perfect discrimination.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>We have shown that HomPRIP, a sequence homology-based method, can reliably predict RNA-binding residues when close sequence homologs of the query protein, with known RNA-binding residues, can be found. A sequence-based machine learning classifier, SVMOpt, returns reliable predictions for any query protein, regardless of whether structures of protein-RNA complexes containing homologous protein sequences are available. When Safe Zone homologs for a query protein can be found, HomPRIP is the method of choice. For other query proteins, RNABindRPlus, which combines HomPRIP with SVMOpt, has superior performance because it exploits the strengths of both methods. RNABindRPlus outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, both sequence-based and structure-based, for predicting RNA-binding sites in proteins. An important advantage of RNABindRPlus is that it is a purely sequence-based approach.
