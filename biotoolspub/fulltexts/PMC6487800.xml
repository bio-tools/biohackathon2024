        <title>Background</title>
        <p>Osteoporosis is a common, complex disease of bone with a strong heritable component, characterized by low bone mineral density, microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue and an increased risk of fracture. Due to limited drug selection for osteoporosis and increasing morbidity, mortality of osteoporotic fractures, osteoporosis has become a major health burden in aging societies. Current researches for identifying specific loci or genes involved in osteoporosis contribute to a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and the development of better diagnosis, prevention and treatment strategies. However, little is known about how most causal genes work and interact to influence osteoporosis. Therefore, it is greatly significant to collect and analyze the studies involved in osteoporosis-related genes. Unfortunately, the information about all these osteoporosis-related genes is scattered in a large amount of extensive literature. Currently, there is no specialized database for easily accessing relevant information about osteoporosis-related genes and miRNAs.</p>

OsteoporosAtlas enables users to retrieve, browse and download osteoporosis-related genes and miRNAs. Gene ontology and pathway analyses were integrated into OsteoporosAtlas. It currently includes 617 human encoding genes, 131 human non-coding miRNAs, and 128 functional roles. We think that OsteoporosAtlas will be an important bioinformatics resource to facilitate a better understanding of the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and developing better diagnosis, prevention and treatment strategies.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Osteoporosis is a common skeletal disease under strong genetic control (<xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Ralston &amp; De Crombrugghe, 2006</xref>), whose characteristics are low bone mineral density (BMD), microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue and increased risk of fracture (<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Kanis et al., 1994</xref>). Osteoporosis is generally induced by various causes, such as age, sex, genetic factors, a range of hormones and environmental factors. Moreover, genetic factors not only have strong control over osteoporosis and its associated phenotypes, but may also influence sensitivity to hormonal and environmental factors (<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Eisman, 1999</xref>). Osteoporosis can be divided into primary, secondary, and idiopathic types. Primary osteoporosis is more common and mostly caused by old age and postmenopause (<xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Ji &amp; Yu, 2015</xref>). Secondary osteoporosis is most commonly caused or exacerbated by medication exposures or other disorders (<xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">Stein &amp; Shane, 2003</xref>). Idiopathic osteoporosis is a type of rare osteoporosis that often occurs in young, healthy individuals who are not postmenopausal or have other, identifiable secondary causes of osteoporosis (<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Heshmati &amp; Khosla, 1998</xref>). The clinical outcomes of osteoporosis are fracture of hip, wrist, spine and other types. Hip fracture, an international barometer of osteoporosis, is the most severe osteoporotic fracture, 10–20% more women with hip fracture die than expected for age within the first year, and the mortality rate in men with hip fracture is even higher (<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Cummings &amp; Melton, 2002</xref>). Menopausal estrogen deficiency is one of the most important reasons why women are more susceptible to osteoporosis. In addition, men generally have greater cortical mass and larger bone size than women (<xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Richelson et al., 1984</xref>). Alarmingly, osteoporosis affects over 200 million individuals worldwide and the incidence of osteoporotic fractures is expected to rise by 50% over the next decade (<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Burge et al., 2007</xref>). With the aging of the population in recent years, osteoporosis is becoming an increasingly huge public health issue associated with increased mortality and morbidity.</p>
    <p>Osteoporosis is a polygenic disorder, generally determined by the combined effects of several genes and environmental factors. Osteoporosis rarely occurs as the result of single gene mutations. Twin and family studies have shown that genetic factors are extremely important in the regulation of bone density, skeletal geometry, ultrasound properties of bone, bone turnover, and risk of osteoporosis (<xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">Stewart &amp; Ralston, 2000</xref>). Identification of specific loci or genes determining osteoporosis will contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and developing better diagnosis, prevention and treatment strategies. The current efforts to identify osteoporosis loci or genes have mainly focused on three approaches: animal models, candidate gene approach and genome-wide scans (<xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Huang, Recker &amp; Deng, 2003</xref>). Genome-wide association studies have identified over 300 loci associated with BMD. However, little is known of how most causal genes interact with each other and the mechanisms to cause osteoporosis (<xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">Al-Barghouthi &amp; Farber, 2018</xref>). Recently, some studies have shown that how causal genes contribute to the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. For example, the research has shown that Siglec-15 gene-deficient mice exhibit mild osteoporosis and Siglec-15 gene is involved in osteoclast differentiation induced by estrogen deficiency, which suggests Siglec-15 gene is a promising drug therapy target for postmenopausal osteoporosis and age-related osteoporosis (<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Kameda et al., 2015</xref>). C-Abl gene and Atm (ATM Serine/Threonine Kinase) gene result in osteoporosis by positively regulating osteoblast differentiation and bone formation, moreover mice lacking either of them shows osteoporosis, while P53 gene inhibits osteoporosis, which negatively regulates osteoblast differentiation and bone formation, and the knockout mouse shows osteosclerosis (<xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Wang &amp; Li, 2007</xref>). Sclerostin (SOST gene encoded) is an antagonist of WNT/β-catenin signaling (canonical WNT pathway), which predominantly regulates osteoblast differentiation and plays important roles in regulating bone formation. Inactivating monoclonal antibodies against SOST, a inhibitor of the negative regulation of WNT/β-catenin signaling, has been shown to be a candidate for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis (<xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">Rossini, Gatti &amp; Adami, 2013</xref>).</p>
    <p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small (∼22 bp) nucleotides, are single-stranded noncoding RNAs that regulate the expression of target genes by binding to their 3′-untranslated region (<xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">Carthew &amp; Sontheimer, 2009</xref>). miRNAs play critical roles in the regulation of various biological processes by targeting mRNAs, including cellular differentiation and proliferation, apoptosis, and tissue development (<xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">Kim, Han &amp; Siomi, 2009</xref>). An imbalance between osteoblastic bone formation and osteoclastic bone resorption plays a fundamental role in osteoporosis pathogenesis (<xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">Teitelbaum, 2000</xref>). Recent studies discovered that miRNAs play an important role in the subtle equilibrium between bone formation and bone resorption by targeting various genes to regulate osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and function (<xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Ji, Chen &amp; Yu, 2016</xref>). For example, <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. (2015)</xref> have found that hsa-mir-21 overexpression aggravates osteoporosis by targeting RECK. Hsa-mir-34a is a novel and pivotal suppressor of osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption, which blocks osteoporosis by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and Tgif2 (<xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Krzeszinski et al., 2014</xref>). Hsa-mir-133a was shown to directly target Runx2 gene 3′-UTR when overexpressed in MC3T3, an osteoblast cell line. In addition, hsa-mir-133a was also shown to negatively regulate three potential osteoclast-related target genes, CXCL11, SLC39A1 and CXCR3. MiRNA expression analysis in human circulating monocytes shows that hsa-mir-133a is a promising biomarker for postmenopausal osteoporosis (<xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
    <p>Currently, therapeutic drugs for osteoporosis include hormone replacement therapy, calcitonin, selective estrogen receptor, and bisphosphonates, etc. However, due to side-effects and high price, drug selection for osteoporosis is still limited (<xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Martin &amp; Sims, 2005</xref>). Therefore, research for identifying osteoporosis-related genes and their pathogenic mechanisms is greatly significant, which promote a better understanding of the pathogenesis of osteoporosis, identification of novel biomarkers, discovery of therapeutic targets and accurate treatment strategies. However, abundant information of previously confirmed osteoporosis-related genes is scattered in a large amount of extensive literature. Moreover, there is no specialized knowledge base dedicated to osteoporosis-related genes collection, which makes it difficult to understand the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and develop new drug targets for osteoporosis. In order to address this obstacle, we established OsteoporosAtlas 1.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biokb.ncpsb.org/osteoporosis/">http://biokb.ncpsb.org/osteoporosis/</ext-link>) by literature-mining and manual curation, which currently contains 617 human osteoporosis-related genes, 131 human osteoporosis-regulated miRNAs, 84 biological process analysis, and 128 functional roles. Users can retrieve, browse and download osteoporosis-related genes and relevant information from OsteoporosAtlas. Moreover, gene ontology analysis, pathway analysis, and SNP term analysis were integrated into OsteoporosAtlas. In summary, we believe that OsteoporosAtlas will provide a comprehensive osteoporosis research resource for the pathogenesis of individual cases, discovery of drug target, novel diagnostic biomarker, individual treatment methods and precision medication.</p>

      <p>We developed an ontology-based bio-entity recognizer (see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app-group-1">Appendix</xref> for details). Abstract data of CRAFT 2.0 (<xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Verspoor et al., 2012</xref>) corpus was used as the independent test set to evaluate the performance of our bio-entity recognizer by identifying gene/protein based on Protein Ontology (<xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">Natale et al., 2010</xref>). After evaluation, the precision (the number of correct entities identified divided by the number of entities identified), recall (the number of correct entities identified divided by the number of entities in the sample), F-measure (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) of our bio-entity recognizer for identifying gene/protein were respectively 0.959, 0.802 and 0.874, indicating it is of great performance for entity recognition (both the evaluation program and result was available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biokb.ncpsb.org/osteoporosis/Public/file/craft_test.rar">http://biokb.ncpsb.org/osteoporosis/Public/file/craft_test.rar</ext-link>). Therefore, we performed a comprehensive search for osteoporosis-related literature abstracts in PubMed to extract osteoporosis-related genes by using the bio-entity recognizer. Specifically, it is divided into three steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1A</xref>):</p>

      <p>First, data collection: we collected 79,947 sentences in 7,358 abstracts containing the keywords of “osteoporosis”, “osteoporoses”, “bone loss, age-related”, “age-related bone loss”, and “perimenopausal bone loss”.</p>
      <p>Second, candidate data extraction: 1,628 osteoporosis-related candidate genes/microRNAs and 13,264 candidate evidence sentences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Table S1</xref>) were extracted by using our bio-entity recognizer.</p>
      <p>Third, manual curation: our experts manually curated all candidate genes and evidence sentences, 527 encoding genes and 131 miRNAs were finally confirmed as human osteoporosis-related genes. In addition, we integrated osteoporosis-related genes confirmed in DisGeNET (<xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Piñero et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1B</xref>), an integrated comprehensive platform with information about human disease-associated genes and variants. In summary, our database consists of 617 osteoporosis-related encoding genes, 131 osteoporosis-regulated miRNAs (non-coding RNA).</p>

      <p>In order to facilitate the deep interpretation of the association between osteoporosis and related genes, we annotated each gene by the basic gene annotation files (“gene2refseq”) from NCBI FTP site with the information of gene synonyms symbol, genetic location, gene full name, chromosome, gene type, reference sequence information and chromosomal location. We obtained gene ontology annotation for each gene from the Gene Ontology Annotation database (GOA) (<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">Camon et al., 2004</xref>) and gene-pathway mapping relationship from the Reactome database (<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Fabregat et al., 2015</xref>). The database of short genetic variation (dbSNP) (<xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">Sherry et al., 2001</xref>) was used to map SNPs to gene by the publications’ PMIDs (PubMed sole Identifier), which makes it easier to access to genome-wide association study and helps researchers to improve the understanding of the genetic background of osteoporosis. Mapping and annotating are done by using public databases of Entrez gene (<xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Maglott et al., 2005</xref>), Ensembl (<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Flicek et al., 2010</xref>), UniProt (<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Bairoch et al., 2005</xref>), Antibodypedia (<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Björling &amp; Uhlén, 2008</xref>) and neXtProt (<xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Lane et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>The systematic collection of the OsteoporosAtlas 1.0 database provides an overview of human osteoporosis-related genes. Reactome analysis shows that these genes are involved in pathways of signal transduction, immune system, gene expression (transcription), extracellular matrix organization, etc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Gene ontology analysis using Panther indicates that the most common class of osteoporosis-related genes belongs to signaling molecule, followed by hydrolase/nucleic acid binding, receptor/transcription factors, enzyme modulator, oxidoreductase, transferase, transporter, etc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3B</xref>). The Reactome and gene ontology analysis could help biologists to better understand the functional relevance of these genes and guide the experiment. In addition, the existence of many potential pharmacological targets in these pathways we analyzed makes it attractive for osteoporosis drugs discovery. All the results show the value of our collection, demonstrating that the OsteoporosAtlas 1.0 database will greatly benefit exploration of pathogenesis and treatment of osteoporosis.</p>

    <p>OsteoporosAtlas 1.0 also has community curation feature. All users can log in to provide their feedback, confirm or reject the evidence sentence by clicking the “Yes” or “No” button. We will update the database periodically according to users’ feedbacks.</p>
    <p>We identified 94 drug target genes with definite literature evidences in our database. The existing osteoporosis treatment drugs mainly delay bone loss by inhibiting bone resorption or promoting bone formation. However, due to the high price and side effects, the osteoporosis drugs promoting bone formation without side-effects are still in the basic clinical research stages. So our database will help discover new drugs for the treatment of osteoporosis.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>In conclusion, OsteoporosAtlas 1.0 collects 617 osteoporosis-related encoding genes and 131 miRNAs, which is the first database specially to present a comprehensive list of osteoporosis-related genes obtained from published literature. We believe that OsteoporosAtlas 1.0 will be widely used as it can provide facilities for scientists and clinicians in searching the literature on osteoporosis-related genes and their function in diseases.</p>

      <title>Appendix</title>
      <p>The detailed description of methods:</p>
      <p>(1) Construction and processing of vocabulary</p>
      <p>It is necessary to construct different types of vocabularies for natural language processing and semantic recognition, including stop words, high frequency words, domain words and abbreviations. Stop words are mainly from PubMed, MetaMap (<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Aronson, 2001</xref>), and Python NLTK (<xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Loper &amp; Bird, 2002</xref>). High frequency words are mainly from PIR (Protein Information Resource (<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Barker et al., 2000</xref>)) Common English, General Names, Common English of PIR iProLINK (<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2004</xref>) Entity Recognition, and Google 1000 English. Domain words are mainly from the gene/protein, compound, enzyme, and other biochemical naming dictionary in PIR. Abbreviations are mainly from the open source software BADREX (<xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Gooch, 2012</xref>) in Github.</p>
      <p>(2) Collection and processing of literature</p>
      <p>The PubMed abstracts were downloaded in XML format by NCBI E-Utilities API (<xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Sayers, 2010</xref>) and parsed by Python script. The database currently contains approximately 26 million abstracts.</p>
      <p>(3) Collection and processing of ontology</p>
      <p>A high-quality dictionary of human genes/proteins and their synonyms is mainly based on Protein Ontology (<xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">Natale et al., 2010</xref>) and bioThesaurus. And the human protein ID of UniProtKB is used as a standardized ID.</p>
      <p>(4) Entity recognition</p>
      <p>Indexer (Python script) is used to build indexes for the PubMed abstracts. Analyzer (Python script) is used to perform synonym expansion on the ontology. Indexes and synonyms were combined to perform span near match and entity recognition.</p>
