    <title>Background</title>
    <p id="Par21">Drug discovery and/or screening can be an expensive and time-consuming endeavor with traditional methods relying on testing in in vitro or in vivo models or via screening of organs and tissues using synthetic molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In some cases, the expense of a traditional drug development approach may overwhelm the resources available and make cost–benefit discussions challenging when bringing a new therapeutic to market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Therefore, developing cost-efficient in silico strategies to screen for drug candidates that may be efficacious in treating human disease may result in novel or repurpose-able therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. With the rise of integrated -omics technologies, phenotypic screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], network-based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and literature mining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], new approaches that take advantage of large data-driven methodologies are at the forefront of drug screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Taking advantage of available knowledge, we propose a transcriptomically-driven drug screening approach that utilizes enrichment methods to determine candidate therapeutics.</p>
    <p id="Par22">Discovery-based enrichment methods can be used for finding matching transcriptomic signatures of drug-disease comparisons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. One approach, referred to as the signature reversion principle, has been successful in diverse therapeutic settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It assumes that a drug induced gene expression signature will be correlated with change of the transcriptome in disease to a healthy or healthier state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Our premise is that a negatively correlated gene profile of a drug-perturbated transcriptome can be exploited in in silico drug screening methodologies.</p>
    <p id="Par23">Gene set enrichment techniques are well established in providing biological context in -omics studies, particularly in transcriptomic studies where summarizing the overall biology of a particular contrast or linear model by pathways enhances interpretability. We have used gene set enrichment techniques in a variety of transcriptional studies that compare or contrast the human host response to infectious or chronic illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Of the various enrichment approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) and Gene Ontology (GO) are gold standards in pathway and gene set enrichment for transcriptomic analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], but unfortunately, their direct application in drug screening may not be ideal due to the lack of incorporation of drug-gene modulatory information. While other popular approaches such as gene2drug, DSEA, sscMAP, L1000cds, and CMAP-native methods may include such information, they lack the statistical rigor of GSEA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]: none perform error rate analysis, calculate score normalizations, provide enrichment driver genes, or are tailored for transcriptomic analyses.</p>
    <p id="Par24">By performing enrichment on disease-associated gene signatures while using drug perturbation defined gene sets, entire transcriptomes can be probed for potential drugs or therapeutics. We propose a modified version of GSEA, namely drug perturbation GSEA (dpGSEA), to perform a unique drug-defined gene set enrichment analysis for screening therapeutics downstream of transcriptomic or proteomic studies. We describe dpGSEA as an analysis tool that emphasizes enrichment of counteracting gene expression between drug-gene and disease-gene profiles and provides an easily interpretable set of statistics to determine effectiveness of screened drugs. By using proto-matrices to capture <italic>a-</italic>priori drug perturbated gene signatures rather than gene sets, we believe our approach is well suited for transcriptomic-based therapeutic screening and enrichment.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="Sec3">
    <title>Methods</title>
    <p id="Par25">We provide a comparison between dpGSEA and related approaches in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and detailed definition, notation, framework, statistic, normalization and error rate notes in the Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Methods.
<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Comparisons between dpGSEA and similar approaches. <bold>a</bold> dpGSEA’s primary differences compared to GSEA include usage of a-priori gene set information derived from the Broad Institute’s connectivity map project (CMAP) and the library of integrated network-based cellular signatures (LINCS) projects organized as proto-matrices, an absolute statistical significance ranked approach rather than a fold change ranked approach, and a novel statistic to evaluate the drug target. Both approaches utilize a random walk running sum statistic to calculate enrichment scores. dpGSEA requires two inputs from the user to run. <bold>b</bold> dpGSEA is listed with comparable techniques that utilize GSEA-like approaches. Our approach uses the significance of a gene as well as directionality along with the generation of a novel statistic, the target compatibility score. We also show the driver genes for each drug</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12859_2020_3929_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
    <sec id="Sec4">
      <title>dpGSEA gene set priors</title>
      <p id="Par26">An overview of the dpGSEA processing, including the proto-matrix is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. dpGSEA utilizes transcriptomic signatures of drug perturbated cell lines from Broad Institute’s connectivity map project (CMAP) and the library of integrated network-based cellular signatures (LINCS) projects to produce annotated gene sets rather than curated lists, like those from MSigDB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. These gene sets are organized into proto-matrices as defined by gene signature cutoffs of ranked top fold change or statistical significance. The proto-matrix itself contains information including genes acted on by a specific drug and the directionality in which it is influenced, that is, whether the drug induces up or down regulation of the gene.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Overview of the dpGSEA pipeline and enrichment approach. Beginning from the left side of the diagram, the two primary inputs of dpGSEA are shown as tables. The top left table lists DEGs from, for example, a disease versus control study. The bottom left table contains the proto-matrix, which is analogous to MSigDB defined gene sets but contains a list of drug-gene actions rather than a gene set. dpGSEA merges the information in these tables by gene and ranks them by the absolute value of their significance. dpGSEA then estimates a running sum statistic based on drug-gene interaction and regulation. Highlighted in yellow are negatively correlated drug-gene interactions (opposing arrows). Enrichment distributions are formed [dotted red line, enrichment score (ES)] determining the maximum deviation of the running sum statistic plot, while the position of the maximum deviation (dotted orange line) represents the target compatibility score (TCS). dpGSEA then permutes the gene locations and generates new enrichment distributions along with null-enriched ES and TCS. The permutations are used to both normalize and generate statistical significance for each score. The output is a list of drugs ranked by their ES or TCS statistical significance (bottom center table). It should be noted that leading-edge genes are also included in the output (not shown)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12859_2020_3929_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par27">To generate the proto-matrices, differential expression (DE) analysis using default LIMMA-voom parameters in Bioconductor was performed on the CMAP and LINCS data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. For each drug, a DE experiment was conducted using the correspondingly batched DMSO sample as controls, while remaining effects were linearly corrected. The resulting genes were ranked by fold change and statistical significance to generate a specific signature, that is, the top 10, 20 or 50 genes acted upon by a specific drug with the cell-line information retained (these are labeled as “Sig Rank 10” or “FC Rank 20”, etc. with the first label denoting fold change or significance and the last label denoting the number of top ranked genes).</p>

      <title>Normalization, significance, and error rate</title>
      <p id="Par32">Normalization places ES and TCS scores on respective comparable scales. A null distribution is created by gene label permutation of list <italic>L</italic> while retaining original gene label rank-ordering; this is performed for 1000 permutations. The normalization factor is the change of scale obtained by the mean of the scores generated by the permuted distributions, and the normalized score is then obtained by simply dividing the true score by this normalization factor. The significance of the true score is determined by the proportion of permuted scores that are greater than the true score, and our null hypothesis states that the true score is no different from those generated by random gene label permutation.</p>
      <p id="Par33">The multiple testing problem is addressed by our procedure carried out to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR). After a full experimental run of dpGSEA, the FDR is calculated by comparison of the proportion of all permuted null normalized scores for every drug screened greater than the specific score of a drug in question. This is performed for each ES and TCS respectively and is the approach utilized by GSEA.</p>

    <sec id="Sec7">
      <title>Testing dpGSEA</title>
      <p id="Par34">We approached testing dpGSEA in a two-fold manner. (1) We determined if dpGSEA was able to positively identify a perturbated drug from an external DE experiment through positively correlated gene modulation, as opposed to the signature reversion principle. (2) We used dpGSEA as intended, an exploratory tool for drug screening, to determine if the therapeutics detected have biological or phenotypic relevance to a disease in question.</p>
      <p id="Par35">For the first case, we tested third party gene signatures, not those from CMAP or LINCS, derived from gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor cells (GEPNTs) perturbated by fluvastatin, parbendazole (against drug-defined gene sets present and generated from CMAP), paclitaxel, rosiglitazone (against drug-defined gene sets present and generated from LINCS), and doxorubicin (against drug-defined gene sets present and generated from both CMAP and LINCS) (Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) #GSE98894) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Drug perturbation DE for GEPNTs was performed using LIMMA-voom and matching signatures were detected using dpGSEA.</p>
      <p id="Par36">For the second case, drug screening, we applied dpGSEA to our recent study of differential gene expression in CD4+T regulatory cells (Tregs) from immune responders (IR) and nonresponders (INR) to antiviral therapy in HIV-infected individuals (GEO #GSE106792) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This study assessed HIV-infected individuals for their ability to reconstitute the CD4+T cell pool in response to antiretroviral treatment and what candidate mechanisms were behind poor clinical outcomes and greater risk for morbidity and mortality with respect to INR status. Mitochondrial Treg mechanisms were implicated to be the cause of the cell cycle halting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. We analyzed this dataset with dpGSEA to determine whether we could identify drugs that may take advantage of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in mitochondrial dysfunction or immune function as a whole in INRs.</p>

It is worth mentioning that not every GEPNTs drug perturbation was positively identified by every proto-matrix by ES and TCS FDR thresholds, but we were able to positively identify all perturbations in most case with the exception of rosiglitazone by ES FDR and fluvastatin by TCS FDR. Paclitaxel perturbations were most frequently positively identified by both scores and primarily by significance-based LINCS proto-matrices, while other drugs varied in their positive findings with

Here, we use the CMAP top 20 ranked significantly proto matrix as our <italic>a-</italic>priori signature for dpGSEA and correspondingly equivalent inputs (top 20 genes by significance) for other approaches. It should be noted that directionality is integrated into the dpGSEA enrichment approach producing only positive scores as reflected by the one-sided distribution of Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b. The ranked drugs that pass nominal GSEA-defined FDR, and Benjamini–Hochberg (BH)-defined FDR adjusted thresholds are also shown. Using the GSEA-FDR threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], we find many drug screens that pass FDR = 0.05. This is in stark contrast to those approaches without inherent error rate analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c, d) that have few or no screened drugs that pass the BH-FDR threshold at the same level. Therefore, the dpGSEA screened drug results provide a richer and more reliable ranking of drugs for the clinician. In addition, it should be noted that this result is achieved by dpGSEA despite the fact that the GSEA-defined FDR procedure is inherently more conservative (less inductive of downward bias) than the BH-defined FDR procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], especially in cases of lower α values (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1). Last but not the least, note the statistically significant findings of screened drugs (highlighted in green in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) that pass a designated FDR significance threshold (0.05) unique to dpGSEA’s novel TCS statistic.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Comparisons between the trends of scores and significance for dpGSEA and the CMAP native and gene2drug approach.

Screened drugs that pass a designated FDR significance threshold (0.05) are shown in red, and screened drugs highlighted in green show statistically significant findings unique to dpGSEA’s novel TCS.

Furthermore, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S3 shows a comparison between the positively identified fluvastatin perturbation for various proto-matrices. As <italic>a-</italic>priori signature sizes increase, we see fluvastatin migrate from lack of statistical significance to close and beyond TCS significance at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and ultimately to ES significance at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. This may suggest that TCS is more capable of detecting enrichment for smaller gene set sizes.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par42">The accurate portrayal of disease-gene and drug-gene complementary expression was the impetus for the development of dpGSEA. There are two features of dpGSEA that underscore its novelty in comparison to GSEA and other approaches, namely our indicator function denoting complementary disease-gene and drug-gene expression and the utilization of drug-derived gene set priors that include drug-gene modulation information. GSEA, in its current state, is not capable of producing results that can be interpreted with directionality of modulation by gene set priors for enrichment. Indeed, MSigDB gene sets, for example, only contain gene membership information. In cases where enrichment does take modulation of expression within a gene set into account, such as those defined in the C6 and C7 collections, the representation of a single biologically-defined gene set is dichotomized into up and down regulated groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This is less than ideal as interpretation of enrichment must be contextualized with two scores and two significance levels, making biological interpretations difficult in cases where two sets of estimates may not be congruent. Further, our results differ from those generated by traditional GSEA as shown by notable changes in rank of paclitaxel perturbated cell lines in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, suggesting that the signature reversion principle plays a role when it comes to directionally influenced enrichment. In addition, with respect to GSEA but unlike other methods, we report FDR results in dpGSEA analyses that reflect a combination of both sensitivity and specificity metrics. However, in order to generate more specific accuracy metrics results like specificity and sensitivity, a simulation study of joint true drug perturbation and true DE (i.e. where the truth would be known for both) would be required to allow us to compare our candidate drug end results.</p>
    <p id="Par43">When compared to other drug screening approaches shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, we uniquely use both degree of modulation, as represented by DE significance, and directionality for enrichment. Methods such as gene2drug and DSEA require less conventional inputs, which will allow for application beyond transcriptomics but requires users to query with a single gene, a set of pathways, or a set of drugs without considering directionality of modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Although these approaches are versatile, dpGSEA takes advantage of the statistics generated in a DE experiment, making it uniquely postured for tackling transcriptomic drug screening. CMAP-native, L1000cds, and sscMAP approaches consider directionality, but not DE significance, and instead use ordered lists or sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, we retain important aspects pivotal in GSEA’s success, such as score normalization and true FDR analysis in our approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. When comparing results between dpGSEA, CMAP native, and gene2drug, we see our approach provides for a greater number of drug screens that pass error correction. Our intrinsically less conservative GSEA-defined measurement of error is more appropriate for drug screening compared to the BH procedure. In our and other test cases the BH procedure shows strong bias towards exclusion of possible positive drug screens as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c, d, especially in cases of screens with high statistical significance, where the bias is most substantial (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). The BH procedure, and others like it, is insufficient in understanding false discovery in these drug screening approaches which calls for an inherent method such as the one we have applied. Furthermore, for exploratory screenings, a less conservative error analysis that maintains strict statistical rigor is ideal. As a result, dpGSEA is fundamentally different from the aforementioned approaches, and we believe it can be an effective tool for drug screening for transcriptomic DE experiments. Furthermore, our novel statistic, TCS, serves as an alternative to the traditional ES by emphasizing gene rank with a DE experiment rather than statistical significance. It provides for another valid means of screening and, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, elucidates a substantial number of otherwise ignored, but possibly important and effective, drug screens. This allows future studies another avenue for justification of exploration for a specific drug or gene target of interest if ES significance is not met.</p>
    <p id="Par44">When testing dpGSEA we were able to positively identify drug perturbations of paclitaxel, parbendazole, doxorubicin, rosiglitazone, and fluvastatin in GEPNTs, but we want to emphasize that dpGSEA’s primary purpose is discovery screening rather than identification. Our identification testing is a proof-of-concept for how our approach, in theory, can effectively apply the signature reversion principle in enrichment and detect drug perturbation signals for an external data set. We believe our true use-case test of dpGSEA on INR versus IR DE where mitochondrial and immunological associated drugs were found, is more revealing of dpGSEA approach’s capabilities.</p>
    <p id="Par45">Our scores, analogous to traditional GSEA scores, are rigorously generated while adjusted for false discovery to ensure the best possible accuracy. With respect to analytical studies based on DE analysis, i.e. all transcriptomic enrichment approaches, inferences made by dpGSEA will rely upon the validity of the prior DE results generated for the first stage of the dpGSEA framework. In line with this point, a recent study supports the importance of ranking statistics in GSEA. As the authors state, “An important parameter, which could affect the final result, is the choice of a metric for the ranking of genes. Applying a default ranking metric may lead to poor results<italic>.</italic>” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] Hence, the important features of our approach include: (1) proto-matrices to capture more information, (2) a more accurate Local Test Statistic such as the Empirical Bayes Moderated Statistic estimated in implementations of Limma or edgeR packages, and (3) error rate control procedures such as FDR selection.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p id="Par46">We contend that our disease-gene and drug-gene complementary expression underpins the novel basis for dpGSEA, as well as the robust statistics controlled by multiple testing correction and the leading-edge driver genes generated by our approach. dpGSEA is an approach that uniquely enriches on drug-defined gene sets while considering directionality of gene modulation, and we recommend dpGSEA as an exploratory tool to screen for possible drug targeting molecules.</p>
