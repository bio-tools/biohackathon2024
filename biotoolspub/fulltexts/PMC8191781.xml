      <p>Single cell chromatin accessibility assays reveal epigenomic variability at <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements among individual cells. We previously developed a single-cell DNase-seq assay (scDNase-seq) to profile accessible chromatin in a limited number of single cells. Here, we report a novel indexing strategy to resolve single-cell DNase hypersensitivity profiles based on bulk cell analysis. This new technique, termed indexing single-cell DNase sequencing (iscDNase-seq), employs the activities of terminal DNA transferase (TdT) and T4 DNA ligase to add unique cell barcodes to DNase-digested chromatin ends. By a three-layer indexing strategy, it allows profiling genome-wide DHSs for &gt;15 000 single-cells in a single experiment. Application of iscDNase-seq to human white blood cells accurately revealed specific cell types and inferred regulatory transcription factors (TF) specific to each cell type. We found that iscDNase-seq detected DHSs with specific properties related to gene expression and conservation missed by scATAC-seq for the same cell type. Also, we found that the cell-to-cell variation in accessibility computed using iscDNase-seq data is significantly correlated with the cell-to-cell variation in gene expression. Importantly, this correlation is significantly higher than that between scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq, suggesting that iscDNase-seq data can better predict the cellular heterogeneity in gene expression compared to scATAC-seq. Thus, iscDNase-seq is an attractive alternative method for single-cell epigenomics studies.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Cellular heterogeneity in gene expression, has been extensively studied through single-cell sequencing methods. For example, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revealed significant heterogeneity in primary glioblastomas (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Also, increased levels of heterogeneity in these tumors are inversely correlated with survival, indicating that intratumor heterogeneity should be an essential clinical factor. Successful identification of regulators of this heterogeneity is critical to the development of new therapeutic drugs.</p>
    <p>DNase I hypersensitivity of chromatin informs the chromatin states of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements that govern the expression of target genes including master regulators (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2–5</xref>). Cellular heterogeneity in gene expression has been linked to variation in chromatin accessibility (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), nucleosome organization (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and long distance enhancer-promoter interactions (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>); thus, measuring chromatin states at the single-cell level is of the utmost importance for understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene expression heterogeneity. Several single cell techniques were developed to measure chromatin accessibility, including scATAC-seq (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref>) by Tn5 chromatin tagmentation, scDNase-seq (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) by DNase I digestion for chromatin fragmentation, and scMNase-seq (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) by MNase detection of chromatin accessibility and nucleosome positions. The standard throughput of many of these methods is in the thousands of cells, and of these methods scATAC-seq has the highest cell throughputs; however, it is also known that DNA tagmentation bias exists in the use of Tn5 (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), which may affect the accuracy of the regulator prediction and cell-to-cell variation in accessibility, limiting its potential applications.</p>
    <p>DNase I enzymes have different properties compared to Tn5 (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). However, due to a lack of development in combinational indexing strategies for scDNase-seq, its cell throughput is very low and thus its application in single-cell studies is limited. To address this limitation, we designed a novel indexing strategy, which avoids the use of expensive equipment for automation or microfluidics, to enable the analysis of &gt;15 000 cells in a single experiment. This new strategy, termed indexing scDNase-seq (iscDNase-seq), involves barcoding the DNA ends with a combination of TdT terminal transferase and T4 DNA ligase. We applied it to assay single-cell DHSs from human white blood cells (WBC). Computational analysis of the assay results recovered expected cell types from the WBCs and inferred their underlying regulatory mechanisms in accessibility variation. By comparing our iscDNase-seq data with publicly available dscATAC-seq data (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref>) for B cells, T cells, NK cells and monocytes, we found that iscDNase-seq detects DHSs missed by scATAC-seq that have high sequence conservation and are associated with significant gene expression. Importantly, iscDNase-seq data can better predict the cellular heterogeneity in gene expression compared to scATAC-seq data. Thus, iscDNase-seq is an attractive alternative method for measuring single-cell chromatin accessibility.</p>

        <p>Reagents and oligo sequences are listed in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Materials S2 and S3</xref>. In the iscDNase-seq protocol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>), cells were first crosslinked by two-step fixation and subjected to lysis and DNA digestion with DNase I on bulk cells. After removal of DNase I by several washes, bulk nuclei were aliquoted into 96 wells and barcode P7 adaptors were ligated to the chromatin DNA by the TdT&amp;T4 ligation method. The samples were then pooled, diluted, and redistributed to 96 wells of a second plate with 30 nuclei to each well using a flow cytometry sorter. After reverse-crosslinking of DNA overnight at 65°C, a second barcode (well index) primer complementary to the P7 adapter, was introduced to the DNA template directly by one-cycle of polymerase chain reaction (PCR1). Then, all PCR1 products were pooled, ligated to P5 adaptor and re-amplified by PCR2 primers that introduced the third barcode (i5 index). Finally, all of PCR2 products were pooled and sequenced, with the expectation that most sequence reads bearing the same combination of barcodes will be derived from a single cell (estimated collision rate of ∼13% for experiments described here)</p>

        <p>The isolated 50M of PBMC suspended in 50 ml PBS/MgCl<sub>2</sub> were first fixed by adding 400 μl freshly prepared 0.25 M Disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG, ThermoFisher Scientific, catalog no. 20593) and incubating at room temperature for 45 min with rotation (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). After three washes with PBS, the cells were suspended in culture medium DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and further fixed by adding 1:15 volume of 16% (w/v) methanol-free formaldehyde solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubating at room temperature for 10 min (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The reaction was terminated by adding a 1:10 volume of 1.25 M glycine and incubating at room temperature for 5 min. The fixed cells were collected by centrifugation at 1320 rpm for 7 min and washed with PBS. The fixed cells were stored in aliquots (1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per tube) at −80°C until use.</p>

        <title>DNase I digestion</title>
        <p>The two-step fixed cells (1 × 10<sup>6</sup>) were suspended in 0.5 ml of RSB buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% Triton X-100) and incubated for 10 min on ice. 50 units of DNase I were added to the cells, followed by incubation in 37°C water bath for 5 min to digest the chromatin (Pilot DNase I titration is needed (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>)). The reaction was quenched by adding 10 μl 0.5 M EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mM. The cells were centrifuged at 1320 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatants were carefully removed by pipetting without disturbing the cell pellets. The pellets were washed three times using 1ml 1 × T4 ligase buffer (final 0.1% NP40) to remove the DNase I completely.</p>

To add several Gs at the 3′ end of DNA and allow adaptor ligation, 2.5 μl of 10 μM barcode P7 adaptor were added into each well, followed by adding 5 μl of the enzyme dilution buffer (66 μl 10 × T4 ligase buffer; 330 μl H<sub>2</sub>O; 40 μl TdT enzyme; 13 μl T4 PNK; 78.75 μl T4 ligase) with gentle mixing (pipette up and down 5–7 times).

        <p>After TdT&amp;T4 ligation, nuclei were pooled and re-suspended in 1ml PBS containing 0.1% NP40 and 3 μM DAPI (Invitrogen) for nuclei staining. After 5 min incubation at room temperature, the nuclei were counted under the DAPI fluorescent microscope and 30 nuclei were distributed, using a flow cytometry sorter, into each well of a 96-well plate containing 3 μl reverse-crosslink buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 25 ng/ml Proteinase K, 0.1% NP40) mixed with 10 μl PBS containing 0.1% NP40. Up to six plates of cells were collected. The plates were sealed completely and incubated at 65°C overnight on PCR machine with lid heating. After reverse-crosslinking, add 2.5 μl of 2 μM well index primer and 15 μl of 2 × Phusion<sup>®</sup> master mix (New England BioLabs, catalog no. M0531S) into each well for PCR1 amplification without DNA purification. The PCR1 was done under the following condition: 98°C, 3 min; followed by 12 cycles of 65°C, 30 s and 72°C, 30 s; one cycle of 72°C, 5 min. After PCR1, for each 96-well plate, all of the products were pooled and incubated with 96 μl of Exonuclease I (ThermoFisher Scientific, catalog no. EN0582) at 37°C for 30 min to degrade the excessive of well index primers. DNA was then purified by the MinElute<sup>®</sup> Reaction Cleanup Kit (Qiagen, catalog no. 28206).</p>

The 220–600 bp fragments were isolated using the 2% E-Gel<sup>®</sup> EX Agarose Gels (Invitrogen, cat #G401002) and purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen). The concentration of the purified DNA was measured using Qubit dsDNA HS kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The paired-end 50–6–8–50 sequencing was performed using the Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq 3000.</p>

Thirty single cells were sorted into each of the 480 wells by FACS and sent to sequencing after the library's preparation steps. All sequencing data was paired-end. The R2 reads contained the information of cell barcodes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material S2</xref>). For each well, R1 reads were mapped to the human reference genome (UCSC hg18) using Bowtie2 (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Using the cell barcode information from R2 reads, we separated the mapped R1 reads into 96 sets corresponding to the 96 cell barcodes. Reads with mapping quality &lt;10 were removed and duplicated reads were removed. For each well, in order to determine the sets of mapped reads among the 96 sets were from single cells, we ranked the 96 sets of mapped reads based on the total number of mapped reads in the sets. A set of reads were considered to be from single cells if they satisfied:</p>

Totally, bulk cell DNase-seq libraries were downloaded from ENCODE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). For each of the bulk-cell DNase-seq library, peaks were called using MACS2 (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), and peaks from all libraries were merged if they overlapped by at least 1 bp. Finally, 218 595 were identified for the bulk-cell DNase-seq data for human WBC. The width of peaks was fixed to be 1,000bp. A further filtering step was applied to the selected single cells by requiring that reads in single cell need to be &gt;4000 and FRiP (fraction of reads in peaks defined by the bulk-cell DNase-seq data) of single cell need to be &gt;0.15.</p>

      <p>The iscDNase-seq procedure is illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S1 and S2</xref>. Following DNase I digestion of cells crosslinked with formaldehyde and disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG), several dGs are added to the DNA ends by the activity of TdT in the presence of T4 DNA ligase and oligo-dC barcode adaptors in a 96-well plate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Following base-paring with the oligo-dGs at the DNA ends, the oligo-dC barcode adaptors are ligated to the DNA ends by T4 DNA ligase. The cells are then pooled from 96 wells and aliquoted into new 96-well plates with 30 cells per well by flow cytometry sorting followed by two consecutive rounds of PCR amplification and indexing of DHS DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). The combination of three rounds of barcoding and indexing enables detection of over 15 000 cells in a single experiment.</p>
      <p>We first applied iscDNase-seq to WBCs purified from human blood to detect open chromatin regions at single cell resolution. Using a cutoff to filter cells with less than 1000 reads and a fraction of reads in peaks (FRiP) smaller than 15%, we detected ∼15 000 single cells and 10 000 reads per cell on average in a single experiment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Using a more stringent filtering criterion where a cell must have at least 4000 reads resulted in ∼10 000 single cells and 12 000 reads on average (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3A and S3B</xref>). The read statistics of single cells was shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material S1</xref>. To test potential doublet formation by random collision between any two cells, human WBCs and mouse splenocytes mixed, cross-linked, subjected to DNase I digestion and processed for library construction. From the sequencing data, we observed a collision rate of approximately 13% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3C</xref>), which was similar to a previous barcoding strategy for single-cell ATAC-seq (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The genome browser snapshots (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) show highly consistent profiles between the pooled single-cell and bulk cell ENCODE DNase-seq data. The mean of Fraction of reads in peaks is ∼0.16 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). We detected 218 595 and 132 926 DHSs from the bulk cell ENCODE data and the pooled single cell data, respectively, in which 112 091 (84%) overlapped (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). The read densities of the pooled cells and the ENCODE data were highly correlated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>).

      <title>iscDNase-seq data accurately cluster sub-types of cells in WBC</title>
      <p>Human WBCs contain T cells, NK cells, monocytes, and B cells. To benchmark cell cluster annotations, we applied iscDNase-seq to human CD4 T cells, B cells, NK cells, and monocytes that were purified by flow cytometry sorting. Using the same filtering strategy as the human WBCs, we obtained 699 B cells, 3590 monocytes, 1421 T cells, and 1923 NK cells. To cluster the single cells from each specific cell type, we first calculated read counts in the DHSs identified from the pooled single cell data for each of the sorted cell types and whole WBCs. Next, we applied the Latent Semantic Indexing method to normalize the data. Finally, the dimensionality reduction t-SNE was directly applied to the normalized read count matrix (Materials and Methods). Finally, the cluster results were visualized along with annotations of the known cell types and clusters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">B</xref>). The clustering analysis of WBCs revealed four clusters of cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The sorted B cells, T cells, NK cells and Monocytes were clearly clustered separately (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Comparison between the unsupervised and annotated clusters in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> suggests that clusters 1, 2, 3 and 4 belonged to B cells, Monocytes, T cells and NK cells, respectively. In order to evaluate the cluster annotations, we defined accuracy as the purity of a cluster or the largest fraction of one of the sorted cell types in a cluster. For example, the fraction of sorted B cells in cluster 1 is close to 100%, while the fractions of other sorted cell types are near zero; thus, cluster 1 cells are more likely to be annotated as B cells, and its cluster accuracy is close to 100%. We found that the cluster accuracies for clusters 1, 2, 3 and 4, which corresponded to B cells, Monocytes, T cells, and NK cells, were all &gt;97% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Within the human WBCs, there were about 47% monocytes, 19% T cells, 25% NK cells and 9% B cells. Overall, the iscDNase-seq data successfully clustered the four types of immune cells in human WBCs, which indicates that iscDNase-seq is able to identify cell type specific DHSs that can be used in downstream clustering.</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="gkab102fig2"/>
      </fig>
      <p>Next, we examined whether any clusters were results of cell doublet formation. The reads per cell were visualized in the tSNE plots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4A</xref>), and the results showed that the cells with extremely high read numbers did not aggregate in any one particular cluster, suggesting that the formation of potential doublets did not affect the clustering results. Furthermore, by examining the accessibility of several genes encoding cell-type specific TFs in the cells of the different clusters, we observed that cell-type specific TF genes (PAX5 for B cells, CEBPB for monocytes, TCF7 for T cells, and MAF for NK cells) exhibited the highest accessibility in the clusters annotated to be the same cell types that express the gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>).</p>
      <p>Next, we examined whether we could identify cell type specific regulatory regions using our iscDNase-seq data. To do this, we detected the marker peaks that can distinguish each cluster from the other clusters (Methods). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>, the cluster-specific peaks have the highest normalized read counts in the specifically annotated cell types. To identify potential transcription factors that are associated with the cluster-specific peaks, we detected enriched motifs using AME (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). For each cluster, the top 40 significant motifs were selected first, and then of that set, only motifs exclusive to one cluster were kept (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). We found that the set of enriched motifs in each cluster included target motifs for specific transcription factors known to be critical to the cell types that the clusters belonged to. For example, the IRF8 motif, which is specific to B cells (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), was enriched in cluster 1, which corresponds to B cells; the CEBPA motif, which is specific to Monocytes (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), was enriched in cluster 2, which corresponds to Monocytes; the TCF7 motif, which is critical to T cells (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), was enriched in cluster 3, which corresponds to T cells; and the MGA motif, which is specific to NK cells (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), was enriched in cluster 4, which corresponds to NK cells. To further confirm whether these TFs were specifically expressed in the corresponding cell types, their gene expression levels in the bulk cell data were examined and the four TFs were found to be specifically expressed in the corresponding cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>). These results suggest that iscDNase-seq is an efficient method to detect regulatory regions that are associated with cell-type specific TFs.</p>

      <title>iscDNase-seq and scATAC-seq reveal both common and distinct information in WBCs</title>
      <p>scATAC-seq and iscDNase-seq use different enzymes (Tn5 or DNase I) to probe chromatin accessibility, and thus iscDNase-seq may reveal information that is not recognized by scATAC-seq. To test this idea, we downloaded the recent single cell ATAC-seq data (dscATAC-seq) (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) for B cells, monocytes, T cells, and NK cells (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). For both dscATAC-seq and iscDNase data, the cell-type specific peaks were identified using MACS with a peak width setting of 500 bp. By comparing the cell-type specific peaks from iscDNase-seq with those from dscATAC-seq, we found that peaks from iscDNase-seq were highly overlapped with the peaks from dscATAC-seq only when they were from the same cell type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). This indicates that both assays are able to identify cell-specific open chromatin regions. Global analysis of the accessible sites in single cell and bulk cell assays revealed that a non-trivial fraction of the open regions was detected only by the DNase- or Tn5-related assays (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). For example, iscDNase-seq and dscATAC-seq found 3,099 and 48,112 peaks distinct from the other assay in B cells, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, right panel). Visual inspection of the accessible sites on Genome Browser snapshots revealed distinct sites detected by iscDNase-seq and dscATAC-seq across gene loci. For example, iscDNase-seq and scATAC-seq detected same as well as distinct sites across the PAX5 gene locus in B cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). While Site 2 was highly accessible in both assays (brown), Sites 3 and 4 were preferentially detected by iscDNase-seq (red) and Site 1 was preferentially detected by dscATAC-seq (blue).</p>

      <p>To examine the functional significance of unique sites detected by iscDNase-seq versus dscATAC-seq, we first analyzed the gene ontology terms associated with the unique sites. We found that the enriched GO terms for the unique sites detected by iscDNase-seq and dscATAC-seq were very different (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). The GO terms associated with unique iscDNase-seq peaks include histone modifications (B cells), myeloid cell differentiation (Monocytes), chromatin organization and NF-kappaB signaling (T cells), NF-kappaB signaling (NK cells). Many of these GO terms are related to immune functions. However, the GO terms associated with unique dscATAC-seq peaks include canonical WTN signaling pathway and kidney epithelium development (B cells), embryonic organ morphogenesis and skeletal system morphogenesis (Monocytes), axon guidance and neuron projection guidance (T cells and NK cells). These terms are not associated with immune functions. From these results, it appears that the unique peaks from the iscDNase-seq datasets are more likely to be associated with cell-specific functions of the underlying cells. Thus, the unique peaks from the iscDNase-seq date sets may be a better predictor of cell-specific enhancers than the unique dscATAC-seq peaks.</p>
      <p>Next, we compared the nucleotide compositions of unique sites detected by iscDNase-seq and dscATAC-seq. We observed that the unique iscDNase-seq sites were more likely to be AT-rich while the unique dscATAC-seq peaks were more likely to be CG-rich (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). These trends were also observed in the unique peaks from the bulk cell DNase-seq and ATAC-seq data (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). It has been suggested that AT-rich regions were more related to the cell type (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). These results motivated the hypothesis that the unique iscDNase-seq peaks are more likely to contribute to transcriptional regulation than the unique dscATAC-seq peaks do.</p>
      <p>To test this hypothesis, we compared their level of sequence conservation as sequence conservation is often an indicator of functional element. By retrieving the average phastCons conservation scores (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) of the unique iscDNase-seq and dscATAC-seq sites, we observed that the unique DNase-seq sites were more likely to have a conserved region around the center of the sites, while the unique dscATAC-seq peaks have a lower conserved region away from the center of the sites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). Next, we identified the genes that are located near either a unique iscDNase-seq peak or a unique dscATAC-seq peak (Materials and Methods) and compared the expression levels of the two gene groups. The analysis revealed that the genes located near unique iscDNase-seq sites showed significantly higher expression levels than those located near unique dscATAC-seq sites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>). These results suggest that the unique iscDNase-seq peaks may be more likely to contribute to transcriptional regulation than the unique dscATAC-seq peaks do.</p>

      <title>iscDNase-seq provide better prediction of cellular heterogeneity in gene expression compared to scATAC-seq</title>
      <p>One major goal of performing single-cell experiments is to examine the cellular heterogeneity. Elucidating the relationship between cell-to-cell variation in different omics layers is critical for identifying the origins of cellular heterogeneity and understanding how different omics layers interact. Previous studies reported that cell-to-cell variation in accessibility is positively correlated with that in gene expression. However, it is not clear whether the degree of difference in detecting accessibility could affect this correlation. To address this question, we computed the correlation between iscDNase-seq or dscATAC-seq with scRNA-seq as described in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">B</xref>.</p>

(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic diagram showing the calculation for the correlation between cell-to-cell variation in gene expression and accessibility. First, Genes are annotated to the nearest DHSs located within the selected genomic regions enclosed by the red brackets. Second, we computed the density table and gene expression table for dscATAC-seq/iscDNase-seq and scRNA-seq, respectively. Also, for each gene and DHSs, we computed the coefficient of variation. Third, more than one DHS may be annotated to a gene. If it was the case, an average coefficient of variation (CV) was taken over DHSs which were annotated to the same gene. Forth, 20 genes were grouped in a group based on their CV in accessibility. Fifth, we computed the averaged CV for each group of genes and each assay. Spearman correlation was computed between CV obtained from scRNA-seq and iscDNase-seq/dscATAC-seq over the groups of genes. (<bold>B</bold>) By varying the selection of the genomic regions enclosed by the red brackets, multiple correlation coefficients are obtained. In particular, the DHS regions closest to the TSSs were first selected. Then the DHS regions with increasing distance from the TSSs were selected. (<bold>C</bold>) The correlation between cell-to-cell variation in gene expression and accessibility for T cells were plotted as a function of distance, in which distance refers to the distance between the selected genomics regions and the closest TSSs.

      <p>The strategy of calculating the correlation between iscDNase-seq or dscATAC-seq with scRNA-seq is described below (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">B</xref>). DHSs were annotated to a gene if the distance between them is shorter than a threshold (e.g. 10 kb). Therefore, while computing the cell-to-cell variation in gene expression, the corresponding cell-to-cell variation in accessibility can also be computed. Note that the cell-to-cell variation is characterized by the coefficient of variation. Also, genes are aggregated into different groups based on the ranked CV in accessibility. Each group of genes are assigned with the average cell-to-cell variation in both gene expression and accessibility. Finally, the correlation between cell-to-cell variation in gene expression and accessibility over the groups of genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) is computed.</p>
      <p>It is possible that either of the assays detects the more precise accessibility of the open chromatin regions at different distances away from TSSs. Therefore, genome regions that are 20 kb downstream and upstream of TSSs are divided into bins with equal bin size of 1,000 bp. For each assay, we computed multiple correlation coefficients between the variation in accessibility and gene expression, using different annotations of DHSs to TSS based on the consideration of different bins. In each calculation, only bins that have the same distance away from TSSs were considered. Finally, we obtained a set of correlation coefficients which refer to bins that are located away from TSSs with different distances (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). DHSs that are further away from TSSs is expected to have lower impact to the gene expression of the TSSs. Indeed, we observed that the correlation between cell-to-cell variation in accessibility and gene expression decrease, for both iscDNase-seq and dscATAC-seq, when the distance between the considered DHSs and TSSs increases (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). However, the correlation between iscDNase-seq and scRNA-seq is significantly higher than that between dscATAC-seq and scRNA-seq through all distances (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Furthermore, the variation in accessibility of iscDNase-seq peaks annotated to TSS is significantly better correlated with variation in gene expression than the variation measured by dscATAC-seq peaks (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">G</xref>).</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>We previously demonstrated scDNase-seq is a sensitive method for detecting genome-wide DHSs in very small number of cells or single-cells (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Furthermore, cell-to-cell variation in chromatin accessibility calculated using single-cell DHS data generated by scDNase-seq was highly correlated with that of gene expression based on scRNA-seq data (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In this study, we designed a new strategy, iscDNase-seq, to dramatically improve the throughput of single-cells that can be analyzed in one experiment. iscDNase-seq is capable of analyzing tens of thousands of single-cells in one experiment, 100-fold improvement compared with the current scDNase-seq method, without the need of expensive and sophisticated equipment and accessible to most molecular biology laboratories.</p>
    <p>Although both ATAC-seq and DNase-seq provide information on chromatin accessibility, recent studies found that DNase-seq and ATAC-seq can detect different chromatin open regions and DNase-seq is more likely to detect enhancer regions compared to ATAC-seq (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), suggesting that iscDNase-seq and single cell ATAC-seq assays may detect different properties of chromatin. Although our results from comparing the iscDNase-seq data and single cell ATAC-seq data indicated that the data generated using iscDNase-seq protocol has higher background and lower enrichment compared to current dscATAC-seq protocol, the DHS regions uniquely detected by iscDNase-seq showed higher sequence conservation scores than those uniquely detected by scATAC-seq. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the genes located near DHSs uniquely detected by iscDNase-seq exhibited higher expression levels than the genes located near DHSs uniquely detected by single cell ATAC-seq assays. These results indicated that iscDNase-seq is more likely to detect functional elements required for cell-specific gene expression than the single cell ATAC-seq assays do. Consistent with this, we found that the correlation between the cell-to-cell variations in gene expression and DHSs detected by iscDNase-seq is also significantly higher than that between the cell-to-cell variations in gene expression and DHSs detected by single cell ATAC-seq assays. All these results together suggest that iscDNase-seq is an attractive alternative single cell method for single-cell epigenomics studies.</p>
