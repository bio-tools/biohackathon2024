    <abstract id="Abs1">
      <p id="Par1">An important unanswered question in chromatin biology is the extent to which long-range looping interactions change across developmental models, genetic perturbations, drug treatments, and disease states. Computational tools for rigorous assessment of cell type-specific loops across multiple biological conditions are needed. We present 3DeFDR, a simple and effective statistical tool for classifying dynamic loops across biological conditions from Chromosome-Conformation-Capture-Carbon-Copy (5C) and Hi-C data. Our work provides a statistical framework and open-source coding libraries for sensitive detection of cell type-specific loops in high-resolution 5C and Hi-C data from multiple cellular conditions.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="Par2">Chromosome-Conformation-Capture (3C)-based molecular techniques have recently been coupled with high-throughput sequencing to generate genome-wide maps of higher-order chromatin folding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A number of massively parallel 3C-based technologies query genome folding in a protein-independent manner, including Hi-C, 4C, 5C, and Capture-C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. All four techniques rely on proximity ligation and high-throughput sequencing to convert physically connected chromatin fragments into counts of specific interaction events. Briefly, chromatin is fixed in its native architectural state across a population of cells and then digested with a restriction enzyme. Restriction fragments are ligated to form billions of hybrid ligation junctions between two distal genomic loci. The two fragments in a given ligation junction can then be identified using high-throughput sequencing, and their frequency of ligation is proportional to their spatial proximity across a population of cells. Hi-C detects all chromatin interactions genome-wide using high-throughput sequencing, whereas 5C and Capture-C use tiled probes to selectively sequence large, megabase-scale subsets of the genome. 4C queries all genome-wide contacts involving a single chosen restriction fragment. Thus, the protein-independent 3C technologies of Hi-C, 5C, and Capture-C can be used to create high-resolution spatial maps of genome folding on the scale of a few megabases to genome-wide coverage.</p>
    <p id="Par3">Recently published 3C-based sequencing studies have revealed that the mammalian genome is folded into a hierarchy of distinct architectural features, including A/B compartments, lamina-associated domains (LADs), topologically associating domains (TADs), subTADs, and long-range looping interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Loops—groups of adjacent pixels which form a punctate focal increase in interaction frequency enriched above local TAD and subTAD structure—have been identified algorithmically in high-resolution Hi-C maps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The highest resolution maps to date have enabled the detection of tens of thousands of looping interactions genome-wide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A subset of looping interactions occur at the corners of TADs/subTADs and are known as “corner dots.” A leading model for the mechanism of corner dot formation is that cohesin tracks along the chromatin fiber until it is blocked by the architectural protein CTCF, thus extruding out the intervening DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Corner dot TADs/subTADs anchored by CTCF are thought to demarcate the search space of enhancers for their target promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Moreover, enhancers can also connect directly to target genes via corner dots in a CTCF-dependent and CTCF-independent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Initial studies have suggested that specific subsets of looping interactions can reconfigure in development, disease, and in response to genetic perturbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Generally, however, it remains unknown to what extent loops are dynamically altered genome-wide as cells switch fate, due in part to the relative paucity of computational methods to evaluate statistically significant changes in interaction frequency across multiple biological conditions.</p>
    <p id="Par4">As high-resolution Hi-C and 5C chromatin folding maps begin to accumulate in developmentally relevant cellular models, there is an increasing need for methods to (1) precisely detect loops and clearly distinguish them from other classes of architectural features such as local TAD/subTAD structure and compartments and (2) rigorously classify loops by their dynamic behavior across cell types. A number of computational methods report the ability to identify loops in individual libraries generated by Hi-C. Bicciato and colleagues performed a detailed comparison of Hi-C loop calling pipelines, including HiCCUPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], GOTHiC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], HOMER (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/interactions/">http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/interactions/</ext-link>), diffHic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], HIPPIE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], and Fit-Hi-C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The conclusion from this study was that loop calling methods in individual samples exhibit vastly different performance, with no clear gold standard emerging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Importantly, most loop calling pipelines were developed on low-resolution maps (40 kb up to 1 Mb bins) generated with the first-generation dilution Hi-C experimental procedure. More recently, Hi-C maps have achieved 1–5-kb resolution through higher read depth and markedly reduced spatial noise due to second generation in situ ligation and digestion techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We also note that active, unsynchronized extrusion events could create long-range interactions within TADs/subTADs that do not manifest as punctate loops in a 5C/Hi-C heatmap (i.e., transient loops in the making) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Thus, it is likely that first generation loop calling algorithms show a wide dynamic range of performance because they were developed on lower resolution first-generation Hi-C maps and did not explicitly distinguish loops from general non-specific, long-range interactions. The emerging model from second-generation Hi-C studies is that quantitative loop detection in individual libraries requires rigorous modeling of local chromatin domain structure. HiCCUPS explicitly models and accounts for locus-specific TAD/subTADs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and accounting for local chromatin domain structure has therefore emerged as a leading candidate for identifying bona fide loop structures (i.e., persistent loops) in individual Hi-C maps. Building upon advances in Hi-C, similar statistical methodologies have been applied in lib5C to find loops in individual 5C maps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par5">To our knowledge, computational tools are not yet available to statistically test loops for their differential signal across two or three conditions in 5C data. Three tools (diffHic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], FIND [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], and HiBrowse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]) have been published to identify generally differential interactions between conditions in Hi-C data. All three methods in their published, first-generation form were not designed or verified to distinguish loops from higher-order folding patterns such as A/B compartments, TADs, subTADs, or non-specific long-range interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. In the absence of accounting for these features, a large proportion of the differential interactions identified may be due to cell type-specific fluctuations related to technical biases, local chromatin domains, extrusion lines, or higher-order compartments. Noteworthy, the diffHic manuscript indicates that modeling local chromatin domain structure would be essential to evaluate cell type-specific loops, suggesting that second-generation tools which accomplish this might be available in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Computational tools have also been published to call within- and across-condition loops from libraries generated by Hi-ChIP and ChiA-PET assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. However, statistical frameworks built for protein-dependent 3C-methods cannot address the technical challenges unique to 5C and Hi-C data. Overall, a gold-standard statistical methodology for cell type differential loop detection in protein-independent proximity ligation data (both 5C and Hi-C) is an important unmet need.</p>
    <p id="Par6">Here, we present 3DeFDR, a new statistical method and software implementation for identifying cell type-specific looping interactions from genome-wide Hi-C (3DeFDR-HiC) and locus-specific 5C (3DeFDR-5C) data across two or three biological conditions. For locus-specific 5C matrices, 3DeFDR-5C computes an empirical false discovery rate (eFDR) by applying a thresholding scheme on the change in interaction score signal on real 5C libraries from multiple biological conditions and pseudo-replicates simulated from the same biological condition. We implement a controlling procedure in which we iterate thresholds to achieve an a priori determined eFDR under the assumption that all thresholded pseudo-replicate interactions simulated from the same condition are false positives. For genome-wide Hi-C matrices, 3DeFDR-HiC formulates a negative binomial likelihood ratio test parameterized with a Distance-Dispersion-Relationship (DDR) for every pixel engaged in persistent loops genome-wide. Cell type-specific loops called by 3DeFDR-5C have fewer false positives and are more strongly enriched for chromatin modifications characteristic of the cellular state in which the loops are present compared to (i) an established ANOVA test and (ii) our own newly formulated parametric likelihood ratio test (3DLRT). We also benchmarked 3DeFDR-HiC against the leading published Hi-C non-specific differential interaction calling method diffHic and demonstrate superior performance. 3DeFDR-5C, 3DeFDR-HiC, and the parametric benchmarking test 3DLRT are freely available as Python packages to support the next wave of discoveries in cell type-specific looping.</p>

    <p id="Par7">We set out to address a critical challenge in the analysis of looping interactions in 5C data: the paucity of methods for robustly classifying dynamic loops across multiple cellular conditions, a problem which becomes more challenging as the number of conditions increases. Our goal was to develop a statistical framework and software implementation to rigorously identify differential loops from 5C maps across two or three conditions using a target FDR to choose thresholds (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a).
<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Overview of interaction score thresholding procedure for cell type-specific looping interaction classification. <bold>a</bold> A 5C dataset is input as a set of interaction frequency matrices, with each matrix capturing the same set of genomic contacts under a different cellular condition. <bold>b</bold> Raw 5C counts are converted to interaction scores (IS) which reflect bias-corrected, sequencing depth normalized, local expected background signal normalized, and statistically modeled interaction frequency values that are comparable within and between conditions under the assumptions of our model (detailed in the “<xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section and Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). <bold>c</bold> Interaction scores are thresholded to allow detection and classification of looping interactions that are significantly differential across cellular conditions. <bold>d</bold> Seven looping interaction classes after a 3-way thresholding scheme on ES-2i, ES-serum, and NPC cellular states. <bold>e</bold> IS heatmaps at two selected genomic loci.

    <p id="Par8">First, we developed, applied, and benchmarked 3DeFDR-5C using 5C data across three distinct cellular states: mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells cultured in 2i media representing a naive pluripotent state, mouse ES cells cultured in LIF/serum representing the primed pluripotency state, and primary neural progenitors isolated from neonatal mice representing a multipotent adult stem cell state in the neuroectoderm lineage (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. These particular 5C datasets represent large-scale, 4-kb-resolution maps capturing 8 Mb of genomic sequence around key developmentally regulated genes. 5C relies on a primer-based hybrid capture step to selectively detect ligation junctions across specific genomic regions, thus enabling the creation of high-resolution matrices with a strikingly lower number of reads (~ 30–40 million per sample) compared to Hi-C (~ 3–6 billion per sample). We have recently determined that loops are markedly reconfigured during the transition from naive pluripotency to multipotency, thus making this dataset ideal for the testing and development of our statistical framework. We tested and validated 3DeFDR-5C with a three cellular state experiment, but the statistical framework and code are also able to analyze a two cellular state experiment.</p>
    <p id="Par9">We first started by modeling and correcting biases, artifacts, and local chromatin domains in individual replicates. Despite their nuanced technical differences, data from protein-independent proximity ligation techniques share several common features, including: (1) distance-dependent background interaction signal in which non-specific interaction frequency is highest for the closest fragment-fragment pairs on the linear genome and decays as the distance separating the genomic fragments increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], (2) biases in ligation and amplification frequency caused by GC content and length of restriction fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], (3) library complexity and sequencing depth differences across independent experiments for the same biological sample leading to nonlinear batch effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], and (4) highly locus-specific structure due to higher-order folding of chromatin into TADs, subTADs, and compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. One must model and address these features to ensure a rigorous analysis of looping interactions.</p>
    <p id="Par10">We reasoned that a differential loop calling method would have the most utility across protein-independent proximity ligation data if it started with a modified interaction score (IS) in which background signal as well as per-replicate and per-pixel confounding factors had been corrected. We recently discovered that sequence-related biases are not constant across cell types and replicates. Therefore, as is routinely done with Hi-C data, we used matrix balancing to correct for fragment-specific biases caused by GC content and restriction fragment length for every replicate individually (detailed in the “<xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section). We also used conditional quantile normalization to normalize all replicates for non-linear library complexity and sequencing depth differences (detailed in the “<xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section). It is widely known that the distance-dependent background signal and local chromatin domain structure are widely variable across cell types and highly unique to each genomic region. Thus, we used the donut and lower left filters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] to model the distance-dependent and TAD/subTAD expected background signal for every interaction in the genome and every replicate individually (detailed in the “<xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section). After bias correction, background normalization, and expected modeling, we assigned <italic>p</italic> values to every pixel in the 5C heatmap and computed an interaction score (IS) that allows for direct comparison of each bin-bin pair across replicates and conditions under the assumption that the replicates are similarly powered (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Moreover, the use of modeled IS as the random variable for differential testing allows 3DeFDR to have utility for matrices of any protein-independent 3C-based data that have been bias corrected, normalized, modeled, and transformed into <italic>p</italic> values using analysis techniques tailored to the specific method.</p>
    <p id="Par11">To identify differential looping interactions, we used a classification technique that relies on three-way thresholding on the difference in IS across cellular conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S1, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2). For each biological replicate, we began with a framework in which IS is a square, symmetric matrix of interaction scores from a modeled and bias-corrected 5C experiment.

The 3DeFDR-5C algorithm is designed so that the user can tune the final looping classifications to a pre-determined target eFDR.

    <p id="Par28">To evaluate the performance of the 3DeFDR-5C pipeline, we implemented two additional methods for classifying differential looping interactions: ANOVA-BH and 3DLRT-BH (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S3). These methods use ANOVA and our newly formulated likelihood ratio test (3DLRT), respectively, to assign a differential looping <italic>p</italic> value to every bin-bin pair in an experimental dataset (detailed in the “<xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section). In both approaches, output <italic>p</italic> values are then corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg step-up procedure. When we compared ANOVA and 3DLRT benchmarking tests to 3DeFDR-5C, we found that the three different methods had different optimal FDR thresholds for identifying differential loops (Supplementary Figures 4–6, 8–10), with 3DeFDR-5C identifying the known, previously reported looping interactions at significantly lower FDR estimates than the other two approaches (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Thus, 3DeFDR-5C can identify known cell type-specific looping interactions with a lower estimated false discovery rate than ANOVA and 3DLRT benchmarking tests under the assumptions of our model.</p>
    <p id="Par29">To further understand the dynamic loops called by 3DeFDR-5C, we also compared them to chromatin modifications on the 1-D genome as well as to the performance of the leading non-specific differential interaction caller built for Hi-C data. We observed that classes of differential loops identified by 3DeFDR-5C at an FDR of 2% were strongly enriched for genes and enhancers characteristic of cell types matching their differential loop class (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figs. S7, S11). Moreover, we observed that convergently and divergently oriented CTCF motifs were over- and under-enriched, respectively, at the base of loops identified by 3DeFDR-5C (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Together, these data indicate that 3DeFDR-5C calls differential loops that exhibit the known hallmarks of cell type-specific looping interactions.</p>
    <p id="Par30">Finally, we formulated 3DeFDR-HiC to identify cell type-specific loops genome-wide in Hi-C data. To develop 3DeFDR-HiC, we relied on ultra-high-resolution Hi-C data from mouse ES cells and ES-derived NPCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. We first identified loops genome-wide in each cell type individually (see the “<xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section, Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a, b). To identify which of the identified loops were ES- or NPC-specific, we formulated a negative binomial model parameterized by (i) the mean count per pixel across replicates for every biological condition, (ii) a distance-dependent scaling factor to normalize for sequencing depth (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S14), (iii) bias factors for every row in the raw Hi-C matrix, and (iv) an estimated dispersion per pixel across replicates for every biological condition (see the “<xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section). We estimated the dispersion of loops at every 10-kb increment of genomic distance via a distance-dispersion-relationship (DDR) (see the “<xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section, Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). After fitting the parameters of our model to the data, we performed a likelihood ratio test to obtain <italic>p</italic> values against the null hypothesis that each interaction in a loop was not differential and applied the Benjamini-Hochberg step-up procedure to correct these <italic>p</italic> values for multiple testing. At an FDR threshold of 1% and a loop cluster size threshold of 3 (see the “<xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section), we identified 818 ES-specific loops and 1435 NPC-specific loops (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), including the ES-specific loop connecting the <italic>Sox2</italic> gene to its ES-specific enhancer (box 1), and the longer-range ES-specific, NPC-specific, and constitutive loops around <italic>Sox2</italic> at this locus (box 2, box 3) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> b, e). Thus, we can identify cell type-specific looping interactions genome-wide in Hi-C data with 3DeFDR-HiC.

    <p id="Par31">Our 3DeFDR-HiC method makes three critical assumptions: (1) the use of a negative binomial distribution is necessary to account for overdispersion in Hi-C data, (2) the model needs to account for the DDR, and (3) pooling dispersion or variance estimates is necessary to achieve good performance in the face of small numbers of available replicates. To test these three assumptions, we benchmarked the performance of 3DeFDR-HiC on simulated data against three alternative models that each dropped one of our three assumptions. These alternative models included a Poisson model (which assumes mean is equal to variance with no overdispersion), a “global negative binomial” model (which does not account for the DDR), and a “sample variance parameterized negative binomial” model (which does not pool dispersion or variance estimates and uses a sample variance computed for each pixel across replicates instead) (see the “<xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section). We provide the intuition for how each of the three models compares to our 3DeFDR-HiC method in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S13A. Our inspection of distributions of <italic>p</italic> values called on true null simulations revealed that the Poisson model failed to control type I error (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S13B). This failure to control type I error was also reflected in a failure to control FDR in simulations containing truly differential loops (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S13C). Next, we assessed the performance of the different approaches using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves, revealing that the “sample variance parameterized negative binomial” model resulted in inferior cell type-specific loop classification performance compared to 3DeFDR-HiC, which uses pooled dispersion estimates (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S13D). Finally, we assessed the bias of low <italic>p</italic> values in simulated null datasets with respect to distance (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S13E), revealing that the “global negative binomial” model is overly conservative at short distances, where it overestimates dispersion, and overly permissive at long distances, where it underestimates dispersion. Altogether, these results were used to formulate and justify the assumptions upon which we built our 3DeFDR-HiC model.</p>
    <p id="Par32">Finally, to benchmark 3DeFDR-HiC’s performance, we applied diffHic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] to the same Hi-C data. When comparing the two methods, we held constant either the FDR threshold or the total number of significant differential loops. In both the ‘matched FDR’ and ‘matched loop number’ benchmarking scenarios, we observed that diffHic called cell type-specific interactions throughout Hi-C data irrespective of whether or not the interactions were bona fide loops (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S12A,C). We also created simulated Hi-C maps containing pre-defined cell type dynamic looping interactions with a range of interaction strength effect sizes (see the “<xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section, Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). 3DeFDR-HiC markedly outperformed diffHic in the sensitivity and specificity of differential loops called on our simulated datasets (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S12D). As expected, running 3DeFDR-HiC on simulations with stronger looping fold changes resulted in a higher number of differential loops called (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). 3DeFDR-HiC exhibits strong sensitivity and specificity of loop detection which increases with increasing interaction frequency effect size (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), as well as consistently strong FDR control at every tested interaction frequency effect size (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Our simulations can be used to perform power calculations at a variety of effect sizes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), providing estimates of the proportion of uncalled truly differential loops across a range of differential effect sizes. Together, these data characterize the performance of 3DeFDR-HiC and suggest that it outperforms the leading Hi-C interaction caller diffHiC.

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p id="Par33">Since the invention of 5C and Hi-C technologies, the field has been in need of statistical methods and computational tools for identifying differential long-range looping interactions among biological conditions. To date, there is a severe lack of differential loop calling methods available for analysis of 5C data by the scientific community. Moreover, although a small number of “general differential interaction identification” methods have been published for Hi-C data, differential loop calling largely remains an open question because (1) currently available tools do not account for local distance-dependent background signal and TAD/subTAD/compartment structure to identify changes specifically at loops and (2) Hi-C datasets with the resolution necessary for looping interaction analysis have only very recently become available. We describe two variants of our method: 3DeFDR-5C, our original approach designed for identifying cell type-specific loops from 5C data, and 3DeFDR-HiC, a simplified and parallelized variant fast enough to identify differential loops in genome-wide Hi-C datasets.</p>
    <p id="Par34">It is important to acknowledge potential limitations in our methods. 3DeFDR-5C and 3DeFDR-HiC cannot in their current form detect global changes in looping due to a biological perturbation such as nuclear volume change which would lead to global shift in signal at a specific distance scale. We have created our code in a way that allows users to alter bias vectors and scaling parameters to account for their biological question. In cases of global changes, the normalization and correction of samples together would not be preferred. We also acknowledge that our work here represents one of the first in-depth studies of the problem of variance estimation in Hi-C data. To further enhance differential loop calling performance, newer modeling approaches will be needed to improve upon our dispersion estimates in the future. In an ideal scenario, Hi-C data for every condition would be obtained with a high number of biological replicates, thus facilitating the ability to estimate variance on a per-pixel basis and account for the local TAD/subTAD and compartment folding patterns that influence mean and variance estimates at each pixel. Here, we pool interaction frequencies by distance to create a DDR, but future studies may reveal that dispersion is controlled by additional factors beyond distance and biological condition.</p>
    <p id="Par35">In this study, we analyze Hi-C datasets using a 10-kb bin resolution. In principle, our implementation of 3DeFDR-HiC is fast enough to call differential loops using smaller bin sizes; however, we have chosen to present results using 10 kb bins due to the scarcity of Hi-C datasets with sufficient read depth to reliably detect loops at bin sizes smaller than 10 kb. We expect that assessing the &lt; 10-kb bin matrix resolution performance of 3DeFDR-HiC and other differential loop calling models will become an important area for future work as more ultra-high-resolution Hi-C datasets become available.</p>
    <p id="Par36">Our analyses thus far have suggested that variance estimation is not as critical for differential loop calling genome-wide in “C” data as it is for differential gene expression analyses in RNA-seq data. Our hypothesis for this discrepancy is that RNA-seq data has a much higher dynamic range of counts than “C” data and that the dispersion estimates matter most for modeling very highly expressed genes. Consistent with this idea, we do indeed observe that both of our methods (3DeFDR-5C and 3DeFDR-HiC) allow for more sensitive and specific loop detection in the case of ultra-short-range loops where the interaction frequencies have the highest mean. The advantage is, however, small compared to using per-pixel sample variances or a zero-dispersion Poisson model, and future studies will unravel how improved sensitivity/specificity in loop calling will aid in biological discovery in high-resolution Hi-C data. A systematic comparison of all differential looping models—including a more quantitative performance assessment for 5C differential loop calling—remains an important area for future work.</p>
    <p id="Par37">In conclusion, we provide 3DeFDR as a new statistical framework and computational tool for detecting and classifying differential looping interactions in high-resolution, multi-condition <xref rid="Equ5" ref-type="">5</xref>C and Hi-C datasets. We note that the performance of 3DeFDR is highly dependent on the quality of the input dataset and how effectively the raw sequencing counts of detected interactions have been processed to reduce batch effects, correct for bias, and account for distance-dependent and TAD/subTAD background signal. We provide 3DeFDR as a modular coding package that the user may integrate into their own 5C or Hi-C analysis pipeline. For the convenience of users, this package includes companion visualization tools for assessing 3DeFDR results to determine how effectively counts have been modeled for simulation, viewing differential loop calls as color-coded clusters, and computing the enrichment of classical epigenetic marks within classes of called loops.</p>

      <p id="Par90">To benchmark the effectiveness of 3DeFDR-5C for loop calling, we implemented two additional methods for classifying differential looping interactions: (1) we applied conventional ANOVA and (2) we formulated a new likelihood ratio test, 3DLRT. Using these methods, we assigned a differential looping (DL) <italic>p</italic> value to every interaction in an experimental dataset. In both approaches, output <italic>p</italic> values were then corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg step-up procedure for controlling FDR.

        <p id="Par93">As an alternative method for identifying statistically significant differential interactions, we developed a new likelihood ratio test (3DLRT). 3DLRT compares the likelihood of the data assuming that the loop is not differentially interacting (null model) to the likelihood of the data under the assumption that the loop is differential (alternative model). We parameterized each model with parameters that best matched the underlying data under the constraints of that model. If the likelihood of the observed data under the alternative model was significantly higher than that under the null model, then we rejected the null hypothesis that the loop is not differential between conditions.</p>

        <p id="Par99">Finally, we assessed the significance of the test statistic by comparing it to the chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of free parameters in our two models. In our case, the alternative hypothesis model has three parameters and the null hypothesis model has one, so we have two degrees of freedom. We then adjusted chi-square <italic>p</italic> values for multiple testing by applying the Benjamini-Hochberg step-up procedure. The resulting BH-FDR adjusted <italic>p</italic> values were then thresholded according to the user-defined target FDR to determine which interactions are significantly differential. Significantly differential interactions were then assigned to differential looping classes using the same logic as that used by 3DeFDR-5C (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S3 and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2).</p>

        <title>Overview</title>
        <p id="Par130">3DeFDR-HiC was developed to allow application of 3DeFDR to Hi-C data by addressing the key ways in which Hi-C data differs from 5C data. First, Hi-C contact matrices are significantly larger than 5C contact matrices. The large size of the data makes it infeasible to generate large numbers of simulated replicates needed for estimation of the null distribution of the 3DeFDR-5C test statistic. Second, Hi-C datasets are typically analyzed using a different set of transformations than those used for 5C data. Most notably, Hi-C read counts are typically summed within pairs of non-overlapping genomic bins, allowing easy interpretation of the sum of raw read counts in each bin-bin pair as a discrete independent random variable. Modeling of discrete random variables by Poisson or negative binomial (NB) distributions permits the formulation of a dramatically simplified statistical model whose FDR can be determined directly from analytically defined null distributions fitted directly to the real data rather than empirical distributions estimated via complex transformations and computationally expensive simulations. In the following sections, we describe the simplified statistical model that makes up 3DeFDR-HiC, how we estimated this model’s parameters, and how we used this model to test for differential loops.</p>

In order to facilitate convergence of the algorithm, we filtered out sparse rows and columns of the contact matrix. Specifically, we filtered out any row of the contact matrix with fewer than 25 nonzero entries within the first 300 entries counting from the diagonal in either direction (upstream or downstream). After matrix balancing, we filtered out rows and columns with bias factors above 10 or below 0.1, as we and others have observed that these rows and columns are likely to contain artifacts from the balancing procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].</p>

        <title>Estimating the dispersion</title>
        <p id="Par142">To estimate dispersion parameters using only a small number of replicates, we took advantage of the large number of pixels in Hi-C datasets. Similar to the underlying assumption in 3DeFDR-5C, we assumed that binned Hi-C read counts at similar distance scales should have similar statistical properties. Therefore, we pooled interactions with identical interaction distances to obtain less noisy estimates of the dispersion parameter. To account for the dependence between dispersion and mean commonly observed in high-throughput sequencing datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>], we pooled together interactions with the same interaction distance (and therefore similar means). We estimated a condition-specific distance-dispersion relationship (DDR), where the dispersion for an interaction can be estimated from its condition and the linear genomic distance separating the two interacting bins.</p>
        <p id="Par143">To estimate the DDR for a given condition <italic>c</italic>, we first computed the mean across replicates of the same condition for every pixel in Hi-C matrices of bias- and size factor-normalized data (Equation <xref rid="Equ43" ref-type="">43</xref>):</p>

We empirically found this LOWESS smoothing fraction to yield reasonable LOWESS fits for a wide range of dataset sizes (number of chromosomes) and maximum distance scales. The optimal choice of LOWESS smoothing fraction remains an open research question, and this value can be overridden by the user with a simple keyword argument. Thus, we obtained a smooth dispersion-distance relationship function <italic>g</italic>(<italic>d</italic>) which returns the smoothed dispersion given a distance <italic>d</italic>.</p>
        <p id="Par157">We observed that dispersion decreased with increasing distance at extremely short distance scales (typically within ~ 70 kb).

Therefore, in addition to the raw contact matrices used for the statistical analysis described above, 3DeFDR-HiC also takes as input a list of loops identified in any of the individual conditions analyzed, called by any external loop calling algorithm. For our main analysis, we used a loop call set which we obtained from merged raw contact matrices from all four replicates of both the ES and NPC conditions in the Bonev et al. dataset, processing these two conditions independently. We identified loops using an approach detailed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] with only a few minor changes in parameters. To parameterize the size of the donut filters, we used <italic>p</italic> = 2 and <italic>w</italic> = 6. We skipped the lambda chunking step; instead, we used BH-FDR directly on the set of all <italic>p</italic> values called across all chromosomes to obtain <italic>q</italic> values. Finally, for thresholding significant loops within conditions, we used a <italic>q</italic> value threshold of 0.025, a minimum cluster size of 4, and we excluded loop clusters with interaction distances smaller than 40 kb.</p>

We then applied Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) control to the <italic>p</italic> values <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic></sub> at all remaining pixels across all chromosomes to obtain corresponding <italic>q</italic> values <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic></sub> for each loop pixel.</p>

        <p id="Par170">We have previously observed that true looping interactions typically involve multiple adjacent pixels in the contact matrix. The same appears to be true for differential looping interactions. In order to avoid false positives caused by single significant pixels that are not supported by other adjacent significant pixels, we clustered all significant pixels at the chosen FDR threshold into clusters of contiguous, directly adjacent pixels and discarded pixels lying in clusters smaller than a specific minimum size threshold. We repeated this process for the insignificant pixels. For the final calls presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, we selected an FDR threshold of 1% and a minimum cluster size threshold of 3.</p>

        <title>Evaluating model performance on simulated Hi-C data</title>
        <p id="Par181">Having simulated raw contact matrices with known true differential loops, we could repeat our differential looping analysis on these simulated matrices and compare the results to the locations of the truly differential loops. In order to perform the comparison, we first constructed a Boolean variable <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic></sub> which is one whenever the pixel at (<italic>i</italic>, <italic>j</italic>) is part of a truly differential loop and is zero otherwise. We then used a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to assess how well the score 1 − <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic></sub> (where <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic></sub> is the <italic>q</italic> value against the null hypothesis that the pixel is a differential interaction) predicted the true differential status <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic></sub> of each pixel (<italic>i</italic>, <italic>j</italic>) which is part of a loop present in the real condition used to generate the simulations (in this case, ES) as determined by the external loop call set. We used this approach to plot the ROC curves shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S12D, and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S13D. We also computed the false discovery rate (FDR) at each FDR threshold along the ROC curve (by binarizing the score 1 − <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic></sub> using each FDR threshold and using the confusion matrix to directly determine the FDR) to draw the FDR control curves shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>d and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S13C. Finally, we used this same approach to plot power (the true positive rate, or one minus the type II error rate) as a function of FDR threshold as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>e.</p>
        <p id="Par182">To assess the performance of our models at different distances scales, we stratified all loops in our real ES call set into short (&lt; 400 kb), medium (400–800 kb), or long (&gt; 800 kb) subsets and assessed the performance of our models at each distance subset using ROC curves (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S13D) and FDR control curves (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S13C). When drawing the FDR control curves for each distance subset, we re-ran the BH-FDR control procedure on the subset of <italic>p</italic> values falling in that distance subset to avoid the possibility that a true positive rate (TPR) at short distances might artificially inflate the FDR at long distances. Since our power (or equivalently, TPR) is lower at long distances where there are fewer reads (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S13D), it is expected that the proportion of false discoveries will be higher at longer distances. Because they are generated by re-running the BH-FDR step on every distance subset, our distance subset FDR control curves are adjusted for this effect.</p>
        <p id="Par183">To directly measure the extent to which our models showed a bias for calling differential loops at different distance scales, we quantified the proportion of loop pixels in each of the distance subsets described above with a <italic>p</italic> value below the 5th percentile of all <italic>p</italic> values in all loop pixels (irrespective of interaction distance). To rule out the possibility that low <italic>p</italic> values are enriched in regions where loops are more often truly differential, we performed this quantification using simulated data containing no truly differential loops. We used this approach to generate the bar plots in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S13E.</p>

        <title>Comparison to simplified alternative models</title>
        <p id="Par184">To justify certain choices made in the design of our model, we compared its performance to that of simplified alternative models. These comparisons are visualized in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S13.</p>
        <p id="Par185">In our Poisson model, we replaced the negative binomial distribution with the simpler Poisson distribution, which does not account for any possible overdispersion in the data. Under this model, dispersion was not estimated or used directly, but was effectively assumed to be equal to zero for all pixels (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S13A, Poisson model). Under this model, the likelihood ratio (corresponding to Equation <xref rid="Equ50" ref-type="">50</xref> above) becomes (Equation <xref rid="Equ57" ref-type="">57</xref>):</p>

In this fitting, we included all pixels which are part of looping interactions, independent of their interaction distance. This approach ignores a clear trend between dispersion and distance visible in the real data (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). This model performed reasonably well on true positive simulations in terms of sensitivity and specificity (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S13D) but showed a strong bias for calling more differential interactions at longer distances and fewer differential interactions at shorter distances (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S13D, green curve and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S13E, green bars).</p>

        <title>Comparison to diffHic</title>
        <p id="Par197">In addition to comparing against our own simplified models, we also compared he performance of 3DeFDR-HiC to diffHiC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] genome-wide on a simulated dataset based on the ES condition of the real Bonev dataset, setting 40% of ES loops to be differential with an effect size of ± 30% (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Table S5). We applied diffHiC following the package’s provided usage guidelines for Hi-C data. We inputted our Hi-C dataset as raw, binned (10 kb wide bins) counts. Library sizes were inputted as the total number of counts in each replicate. Following the diffHic user guide, we first filtered rows with any NaN counts. Then we filtered by average abundance (diffHic user guide section 4.1), discarding any bin-bin pair with an average abundance across all sample replicates of less than 5. We then used the direct filter (diffHic user guide section 4.2) to directly remove low-abundance bin-bin pairs, discarding any with abundances less than 2-fold higher than the estimated non-specific ligation rate (estimated as the median abundance across bin-bin pairs). We chose 2-fold above this estimate as our threshold instead of 5-fold, as presented in the usage instructions’ example, because we found this threshold discarded too many points for us to perform later steps in the diffHiC pipeline. Next as recommended (diffHic user guide section 4.3), we filtered bin-bin pairs as a function of interaction distance, discarding pairs with abundances less than the value expected from compaction (generated using the filterTrended method, no parameters to set) choosing not to increase this threshold by an additional fold change value. Finally, we filtered bin-bin pairs via the peak calling approach (diffHic user guide section 4.4) using the guide recommended values for the filter’s parameters (flank.width = 5, the minimum threshold for peak enrichment min.enrich at 0.17, the minimum threshold for peak counts min.count at 3, and the near diagonal cut-off min.diag of 2L). Next, we applied non-linear normalization (diffHic user guide section 5.2) to remove trended biases between libraries, specifically using LOESS normalization, using type=“loess” for the normOffsets method. We also separately filtered near diagonal points, using by.dist=1.5e6 with method filterDiag and again LOESS normalization using type=“loess” with method normOffSets as presented in the user guide (second half of diffHic section 5.2.1).</p>
        <p id="Par198">We then modeled biological variability between replicates. First, we estimated negative binomial dispersion for each bin-bin pair (diffHic user guide section 6.1–6.2) using a single-factor design matrix design = model.matrix (~conditions) where conditions is the corresponding list of the biological condition label for the input sample set. We performed estimation of negative binomial dispersion using this design. We then estimated QL dispersion using this design as recommended in the user guide, setting robust = TRUE for method glmQLFit (diffHic user guide section 6.3).</p>
        <p id="Par199">Finally, we tested for significantly differential interactions using the quasi-likelihood <italic>F</italic>-test via method glmQLFTest (diffHic user guide section 7.1; no parameters to set) and obtained <italic>p</italic> values adjusted to correct for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method (diffHic user guide section 7.2). We then saved output log fold change and adjusted <italic>p</italic> values for each bin-bin pair to file and then visualized these results using our own tools. We thresholded bin-bin pairs to an FDR threshold, assigned loop classifications according to the sign of the log fold change value, and finally plotted these classifications spatially. Specifically, in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S12, we ran applied this scheme with FDR thresholds of 0.3 (or 30%), 0.25, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001. We used the true labels from our simulations, the adjusted <italic>p</italic> values from diffHic, and the <italic>q</italic> values called by 3DeFDR-HiC to draw ROC curves comparing the performance of the two methods (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S12D).</p>
