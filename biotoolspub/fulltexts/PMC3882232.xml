      <p><italic>Ab initio</italic> assembly of transcriptome sequencing data has been widely used to identify large intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs), a novel class of gene regulators involved in many biological processes. To differentiate real lincRNA transcripts from thousands of assembly artifacts, a series of filtering steps such as filters of transcript length, expression level and coding potential, need to be applied. However, an easy-to-use and publicly available bioinformatics pipeline that integrates these filters is not yet available. Hence, we implemented sebnif, an integrative bioinformatics pipeline to facilitate the discovery of <italic>bona fide</italic> novel lincRNAs that are suitable for further functional characterization. Specifically, sebnif is the only pipeline that implements an algorithm for identifying high-quality single-exonic lincRNAs that were often omitted in many studies. To demonstrate the usage of sebnif, we applied it on a real biological RNA-seq dataset from Human Skeletal Muscle Cells (HSkMC) and built a novel lincRNA catalog containing 917 highly reliable lincRNAs. Sebnif is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sunlab.lihs.cuhk.edu.hk/sebnif/">http://sunlab.lihs.cuhk.edu.hk/sebnif/</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Recent advances in transcriptome sequencing have led to the identification of many lincRNA transcripts (&gt;200 nucleotides) <xref rid="pone.0084500-Cabili1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084500-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084500-Ulitsky1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> that localize in the intergenic region of protein coding genes (mRNAs). These transcripts have very weak or no coding potential for any protein products; their expression levels are generally lower than that of mRNAs thus are often mistakenly considered as transcriptional noises; many of them are transcribed by Polymerase II (Pol II) and spliced like mRNAs while a significant portion of them remain as single-exonic transcripts <xref rid="pone.0084500-Ulitsky1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084500-Derrien1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Emerging evidence suggests that lincRNAs are functional transcripts in various biological systems under different physiological and pathological conditions. In addition, the number of lincRNAs in mammalian species is estimated to be at least twice the number of mRNAs <xref rid="pone.0084500-Managadze1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> with the majority of them are still undiscovered. Therefore, fervent efforts are being made in identifying novel lincRNAs in various biological systems.</p>
    <p>Whole genome transcriptome sequencing, also known as RNA-seq, coupled with <italic>ab initio</italic> assembly has become an effective approach to discover novel lincRNAs <xref rid="pone.0084500-Washietl1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. To this end, RNAs are converted to cDNAs and subjected to high throughput sequencing; the obtained raw reads are then aligned to a reference genome and compared to known gene annotations to generate a list of novel transcripts. However, a high portion of the assembled transcripts are artifacts from genomic contamination or alignment bias, which could be falsely identified as novel lincRNAs. Therefore, the key issue is how to discriminate <italic>bona fide</italic> novel lincRNA transcripts from thousands of assembly artifacts. A widely used approach is to apply several filters, such as filters of transcript length, expression level and coding potential, to remove these artifacts step by step <xref rid="pone.0084500-Cabili1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084500-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084500-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This multi-filtering approach has been proven effective in discovering thousands of novel multi-exonic lincRNAs in various systems <xref rid="pone.0084500-Cabili1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084500-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084500-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084500-Guttman1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. But a large number of single-exonic transcripts were often discarded simply due to the lack of effective ways to discriminate them from thousands of the assembled artifacts. On the other hand, more and more studies have demonstrated that single-exonic lincRNAs are indeed functional. Well-characterized examples include MALAT1 <xref rid="pone.0084500-Tripathi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, NEAT1 <xref rid="pone.0084500-Clemson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, Xist <xref rid="pone.0084500-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, HOTAIR <xref rid="pone.0084500-Gupta1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and Yam-1 <xref rid="pone.0084500-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Therefore, single-exonic transcripts should be considered as an important subclass in lincRNA families; and algorithms towards identification of unknown single-exonic lincRNA transcripts need to be developed. Furthermore, a bioinformatics pipeline, which integrates these filtering steps, is not yet publicly available. To fill these gaps, we designed and implemented an integrative bioinformatics pipeline named sebnif (<underline>S</underline>elf-<underline>E</underline>stimation <underline>B</underline>ased <underline>N</underline>ovel L<underline>i</underline>ncRNA <underline>F</underline>iltering pipeline) to facilitate the identification of both multi- and single-exonic lincRNAs. To illustrate its usage and performance, we applied it on a RNA-seq dataset from Human Skeletal Muscle Cells (HSkMC) to build a lincRNA catalog. Further analysis of these novel lincRNAs reveals their specific genomic distribution pattern and potential functions.</p>

      <title>Pipeline overview</title>
      <p>Sebnif is a comprehensive pipeline for the identification of novel lincRNAs from transcriptome sequencing data. It integrates several important filtering and annotation steps to eliminate the assembly noise and enhance the quality of identified lincRNAs. In practice, it provides an array of options (with optimized default values, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0084500-t001">Table 1</xref>) to offer great flexibility for analyzing data according to the given biological question. The typical workflow is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084500-g001">Figure 1</xref> and elaborated as follows:</p>

      <p>As a downstream pipeline designed to filter assembled transcripts, sebnif uses the outputs of commonly used assembly software, Cufflinks <xref rid="pone.0084500-Trapnell1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and Scripture <xref rid="pone.0084500-Guttman1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. No special settings are required during the assembly procedure, but it must be in “<italic>ab initio</italic>” mode when using Cufflinks (both ‘-g’ and ‘-G’ options are not specified; for more information please refer to the Cufflinks manual at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/manual.html">http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/manual.html</ext-link>) or in “segmentation task” mode for Scripture (see Scripture manual at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/scripture/Segmentation_task">http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/scripture/Segmentation_task</ext-link>). As input, it accepts a General Feature Format (GFF) or Gene Transfer Format (GTF) which is one of the widely accepted standard file formats used to store the transcript structure and associated annotation information. Sebnif can use the output of Cufflinks directly since it is in GFF/GTF format; for Scripture, which outputs files in Browser Extensible Data (BED) format, sebnif implements a utility program to convert it to GFF/GTF format. The detailed information on these two file formats can be found at UCSC genome browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html">http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html</ext-link>).</p>

        <title>Step1: Filter of annotated known transcripts</title>
        <p>To eliminate annotated known transcripts (both protein coding and noncoding), sebnif first compares the <italic>ab initio</italic> assemblies with reference known gene annotations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0084500-t001">Table 1</xref>, “-g” and “-r” options). Currently, sebnif provides annotations from: (1) RefSeq <xref rid="pone.0084500-Pruitt1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> for Homo Sapiens (NCBI37/UCSC hg19) and Mus Musculus (NCBI37/UCSC mm9); and (2) GENCODE <xref rid="pone.0084500-Harrow1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> for Homo Sapiens (NCBI37/UCSC hg19) only. Meanwhile, sebnif also allows the users to provide their own gene annotation if available. During the comparison, sebnif eliminates those assembled transcripts with at least one exon overlapping with any annotated known transcript and those falling into the intron regions. The remaining unannotated intergenic transcripts are collected and split into either multi- or single-exonic group which will then be processed separately in the pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084500-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s2c2">
        <title>Step2: Filter of transcript length</title>
        <p>Next, sebnif, by default, filters the transcripts whose lengths are shorter than 200 bp or unreasonably long (e.g. &gt;10 kbp) resulting from the assembly artifacts or un-spliced pre-mRNAs. However, to provide more flexibility, sebnif provides the option for users to set the lower and upper thresholds based on their requirements. Considering the length distributions of single- and multi-exonic transcripts are normally different (multi-exonic transcripts are generally longer than single-exonic ones <xref rid="pone.0084500-Derrien1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>), sebnif also allows the users to set different length thresholds for them (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0084500-t001">Table 1</xref>, “-m” and “-s” options).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s2c3">
        <title>Step3: Filter of the transcript expression level</title>
        <p>As many lincRNAs are expressed at a much lower level than the majority of mRNAs, it is very challenging to find an optimal expression level threshold to differentiate lowly expressed <italic>bona fide</italic> lincRNA transcripts from the assembly artifacts. To overcome this challenge is the key focus of sebnif. Considering the structure of the multi- and single-exonic transcripts are very different (single-exonic transcripts do not have exon-intron chain), sebnif implements two separate algorithms to identify the optimal thresholds. For multi-exonic transcripts, sebnif implements a Fully Reconstruction Fraction Estimation (FRFE) approach originally described by Guttman et al. <xref rid="pone.0084500-Guttman1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Briefly, we first divide the multi-exonic transcripts in reference annotation into N expression quantiles based on their expression values. At each expression quantile, we then divide the reference transcript set into two categories based on the assembly results: (1) fully reconstructed where the assembled transcripts capture the exact exon-intron chain as the reference annotation; and (2) otherwise partially reconstructed transcripts. At each expression quantile, the assembly quality can be evaluated by the Fully Reconstruction Fraction (FRF) value which is defined by the proportion of the fully reconstructed transcripts. Based on the FRF value at each expression quantile, sebnif determines the optimal FRFE threshold by balancing the sensitivity and specificity as described in Sun <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0084500-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>: using the fully reconstructed transcripts as positive data set and partially constructed transcripts as negative dataset, at each expression quantile <italic>i</italic>, the sensitivity (<italic>sens[i]</italic>) and the specificity (<italic>spec[i]</italic>) for that quantile can be calculated through the proportion of fully and partially reconstructed transcripts. The overall balanced FRFE threshold corresponds to the lower boundary of the expression level of the quantile <italic>i</italic> that is obtained from minimizing <italic>e<sub>i</sub></italic> in the following equation:<disp-formula id="pone.0084500.e001"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0084500.e001.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>
</p>
        <p>Where <italic>i</italic> belongs to [1, N] and <italic>e<sub>i</sub></italic> is a measurement of balanced sensitivity and specificity <xref rid="pone.0084500-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Besides using this overall balanced FRFE threshold, sebnif also provides an option for users to determine the FRFE cutoff based on the quality of their data (i.e. sequencing depth and performance of the aligner and assembler as well as their needs of stringency) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0084500-t001">Table 1</xref>, “-F” option). Only those with expression level higher than the threshold corresponding to the user defined FRFE cutoff will be kept. For instance, a 0.5 FRFE threshold suggests that for each transcript that passed the FRFE filter, it should have at least 50% probability to be fully reconstructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084500-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

        </fig>
        <p>Since single-exonic transcripts do not have exon-intron chain, it is impossible to apply FRFE algorithm on them. Sebnif thus implements a novel approach, named Single-exonic Transcript Gaussian/Gamma Estimation (STGE), to estimate the optimal expression threshold. This is based on the fact that the logarithmic gene expression values often follow a Gaussian distribution (also known as normal distribution) pattern <xref rid="pone.0084500-Giles1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> or a Gamma distribution <xref rid="pone.0084500-Newton1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In the STGE algorithm, sebnif first determines the appropriate model by fitting the expression values of the single-exonic transcripts in the reference gene annotation. Then based on the fitted model, a transcript whose expression falls into either tail of the distribution is considered unreliable and discarded. Users have an option to select the model in STGE algorithm or leave it for sebnif to determine (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0084500-t001">Table 1</xref>, ‘-X’ option); and the probability cutoffs used by the filter can also be decided by the users through the options provided by sebnif (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0084500-t001">Table 1</xref>, “-E” option). In our implementation, not only the lower bound but also the upper threshold could be set independently since the transcripts with abnormally high expression may not be reliable lincRNAs; they could result from ribosomal RNAs contamination, potential pseudo-gene, pre-miRNA or alignment bias towards specific regions (e.g. repeat regions as discussed below).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s2c4">
        <title>Step4: Filter of repeat regions</title>
        <p>Due to the sequence similarity, large-scale transcriptome analysis is often biased against repeat elements <xref rid="pone.0084500-Mourier1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. This bias has a significant effect on the results of the <italic>ab initio</italic> assembly software especially for the single-exonic transcripts because many individual reads originally from these regions may sometimes be mapped to multiple positions in the genome when not using paired-end RNA sequencing. To minimize this bias, sebnif filters out single-exonic transcripts that contain high percentage of repeat sequences. This percentage threshold can be set up with the option provided for the users (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0084500-t001">Table 1</xref>, ‘-p’ option).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s2c5">
        <title>Step5: Filter of coding potential</title>
        <p>Finally, to eliminate those transcripts with high coding potential (i.e. potential protein coding transcripts), sebnif employs our recently developed software, iSeeRNA <xref rid="pone.0084500-Sun2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. For each transcript, iSeeRNA reports whether it is a coding or non-coding transcript with a non-coding score reflecting the confidence of the prediction. Sebnif filters those transcripts with an iSeeRNA non-coding score lower than the user-defined threshold (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0084500-t001">Table 1</xref>, “-n” option).</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s2d">
      <title>Further annotation of novel lincRNAs</title>
      <p>To further increase the confidence of the lincRNAs identified from the above steps, sebnif provides several utility programs to annotate each lincRNA with genomic features around its promoter and gene body, such as tri-methylation of lysine 4, and 36 of histone H3 (H3K4me3, and H3K36me3), Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) and Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) tags; these features are thought to be generally associated with active or expressed transcripts. The utility programs are compatible with several widely used file formats such as BED, SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map), BAM (compressed binary version of SAM) and GFF/GTF. Additionally, the outputs can be easily submitted to further filtering steps.</p>

Sebnif is easy to install and only depends on iSeeRNA, which has been included in the package. The package also contains a testing dataset, which has ∼80,000 <italic>ab initio</italic> assembled transcripts from Human Skeletal Muscle Cells (HSkMC) RNA-seq data. To demonstrate how to use sebnif, a shell script is provided to integrate the data analysis workflow by first configuring iSeeRNA and then running on the testing dataset. Meanwhile, to facilitate the usage of sebnif, especially by those wet lab biologists with minimal informatics background, we also implement sebnif as a user-friendly web server with free access at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sunlab.lihs.cuhk.edu.hk/sebnif/webserver/">http://sunlab.lihs.cuhk.edu.hk/sebnif/webserver/</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084500-g002">Figure 2A, 2B</xref>). Like the stand-alone package, the web server currently supports two species: Homo Sapiens (UCSC hg19) and Mus Musculus (UCSC mm9). Users can upload their <italic>ab initio</italic> assembled transcripts in GFF/GTF or BED format. All the parameters of sebnif can be specified by the users through the web interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084500-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

      <title>Novel lincRNA validation by RT-PCR</title>
      <p>To validate the identified novel lincRNA transcripts from HSkMC, we used RNAs extracted from human skeletal myoblasts (Life Technology). In summary, total RNAs were extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol and treated with DNase I (1 U/ µl; Invitrogen) to remove possible contaminating genomic DNA. cDNAs were then reverse transcribed from DNA-free RNAs using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and diluted 5-fold for further PCR analysis. For validation of the target transcripts, primer sets were designed using web-based tool Primer-Blast (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast">http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast</ext-link>) and specificity was checked with human RefSeq mRNA. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed using ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System in a total volume of 5 ul in each well containing 2.5 ul of Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 1 ul cDNA, 1 ul primers (2uM each) and 0.5 ul nuclease-free water. Amplification conditions were as follows: 2 min at 50°C, 10 min at 95°C followed by 35 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C. After amplification, PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agrose gels.</p>

      <title>Identification of novel lincRNAs in HSkMC</title>
      <p>To illustrate the usage and performance of sebnif on real biological data, we applied sebnif on a publicly available RNA-seq dataset from HSkMC. Raw RNA-seq data (FASTQ reads) was downloaded from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project <xref rid="pone.0084500-Consortium1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. This dataset comprises a total of ∼425 million paired-end reads from two samples sequenced by Illumina Hi-seq 2000. After downloading the sequenced fragments, we first trimmed the adapters, removed the duplicated reads (pre-processing) using in-house programs, and then aligned the remaining fragments to the reference human genome (hg19) using Tophat (version 2.0.6) <xref rid="pone.0084500-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> guided by the GENCODE gene annotation (version 16) (the ‘-G’ option). We performed the <italic>ab initio</italic> assembly on the aligned fragments using Cufflinks (version 2.1.1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084500-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) using all the default parameters to generate 82,745 transcripts, which were then processed through sebnif with all the default parameters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0084500-t001">Table 1</xref>) (For more details, please refer to the README file of sebnif at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sunlab.lihs.cuhk.edu.hk/sebnif/README">http://sunlab.lihs.cuhk.edu.hk/sebnif/README</ext-link>). As aforementioned, sebnif applied multiple filters on these transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084500-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). First, it removed the assemblies overlapping with transcripts annotated in RefSeq. This led to the removal of more than 80% assembled transcripts that are either reconstructed protein coding transcripts or annotated known non-coding transcripts. Since we are interested in the non-coding transcripts in intergenic regions, it also removed those transcripts partially overlapping with exons or introns of the annotated known transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084500.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This filter resulted in the identification of 15,812 novel intergenic transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084500-g003">Figure. 3B</xref>), among which 526 and 15,286 are multi- and single-exonic transcripts respectively. For both categories, those shorter than 200 were removed; single exonic transcripts longer than 10,000 nucleotides were also removed. After passing this length filter, 515 multi- and 14,684 single-exonic transcripts remained. Next, to remove the unreliable assembled transcripts with extremely low expression level, we applied the expression filter on 15,199 novel transcripts. For 515 multi-exonic transcripts, sebnif applied a FRFE threshold of 0.5. For single-exonic transcripts, sebnif used STGE to model the transcript expression profiling and selected the expression levels corresponding to the probabilities of 0.05 and 0.95 as lower and upper probability cutoffs. With these cutoffs, single-exonic transcripts with too low (below 5%) or too high (above 95%) expression level were eliminated. The final numbers of transcript after these filters are 36 and 12,504 transcripts for multi- and single-exonic respectively. When applying repeat region filter to remove single-exonic transcripts that have more than 5% of its sequence overlapping with the repeat regions, 6.8% (852 of 12,504) failed to pass this filter, leaving a total number of 11,625 transcripts. Next, iSeeRNA was used to calculate the non-coding score for each transcript and those with a non-coding score lower than 0.9 (i.e. potential protein coding transcripts) were removed. Finally 9,812 novel transcripts were obtained as a provisional catalog of lincRNA loci in HSkMC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084500.s002">Dataset S1</xref>).</p>

We further performed Gene Ontology (GO) analysis on those protein coding genes paired with lincRNAs using DAVID <xref rid="pone.0084500-Huangda1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084500-Huangda2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The result shows a strong enrichment of GO terms including “nucleus” and “transcriptional regulation” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084500-g005">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084500.s006">Table S4</xref>).</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>Sebnif is one of the first bioinformatics pipelines designed and implemented as a publicly available web server as well as a stand-alone application to facilitate the novel lincRNA discovery. It implements key filtering steps to eliminate low quality and protein coding transcripts. The most unique feature of sebnif lies in its differential treatment of multi- and single-exonic transcripts. Firstly, it implements FRFE algorithm that allows the users to use FRFE threshold for filtering multi-exonic transcripts. Compared with the commonly used expression level (FPKM value) or read coverage of the transcript <xref rid="pone.0084500-Cabili1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084500-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, FRFE threshold is a direct and consistent measurement of the overall assembly quality across different samples. For example, an expression level of FPKM = 1 may correspond to FRFE threshold of 80% in one dataset but only 60% in another, leading to inconsistency of the overall filtering quality. In addition to employing a balanced FRFE cutoff, it also allows users to set up FRFE value cutoff manually, which is very useful when the sequencing data quality is not ideal. Secondly, sebnif is the first bioinformatics pipeline specifically designed for filtering single-exonic transcripts by implementing the STGE algorithm. Emerging evidence show the existence of a large proportion of functional single-exonic lincRNAs, thus omitting them to simplify the identification pipeline will affect the completeness of the lincRNA catalog. Through the STGE algorithm, a complete catalog of lincRNAs can be obtained which will facilitate the associated functional studies.</p>
    <p>To further demonstrate the usage of sebnif, 917 high confidence novel lincRNAs were identified from HSkMC. A large portion of these lincRNAs are single-exonic, again demonstrating the prevalence of single-exonic transcripts in biological systems. It is also interesting to find out that more than half of the identified lincRNAs are divergent lincRNAs originated from the promoter region of protein coding transcript. This finding is in line with several recent studies <xref rid="pone.0084500-Sigova1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084500-Guil1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> demonstrating the prevalence of divergent lincRNA/protein coding gene pairs. Functionally these lincRNAs may regulate their neighboring protein coding genes <italic>in cis</italic> by flagging the chromatin region and recruiting regulatory complex through their RNA-protein binding activities. The enrichment of “transcription” related GO terms indicates that these lincRNAs may be involved in transcriptional regulation through interaction with their associated protein coding genes. It will be an interesting direction to explore in the future.</p>
    <p>We also noticed that although a significant proportion (32.6%) of our lincRNAs can be found in the NONCODE v3.0 database, there was little overlapping with the list of lincRNAs identified by Hangauer <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0084500-Hangauer1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> from HSkMC (data not shown). This inconsistency may largely due to the fundamental differences in the identification pipelines. For example, merged reads from 23 tissues were used as a starting point in their study such that the lincRNAs specifically expressed in HSkMC sample may be considered lowly expressed across all tissues thus discarded during the filtering; also, the filtering criteria for both single and multi-exonic transcripts are drastically different from ours.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, the approach described herein, coupled with available <italic>ab initio</italic> assembly software has the potential to dramatically speed up the identification of novel lincRNAs and represents an important step in the development of high-throughput lincRNA discovery platform. LincRNA catalog obtained through sebnif provides researchers a list of high quality lincRNAs for further experimental validation and functional study.</p>
