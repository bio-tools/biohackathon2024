        <title>Motivation</title>
        <p>The Gene Ontology (GO) is the unifying biological vocabulary for codifying, managing and sharing biological knowledge. Quality issues in GO, if not addressed, can cause misleading results or missed biological discoveries. Manual identification of potential quality issues in GO is a challenging and arduous task, given its growing size. We introduce an automated auditing approach for suggesting potentially missing <italic>is-a</italic> relations, which may further reveal erroneous <italic>is-a</italic> relations.</p>

      <sec id="s2">
        <title>Results</title>
        <p>We developed a Subsumption-based Sub-term Inference Framework (SSIF) by leveraging a novel term-algebra on top of a sequence-based representation of GO concepts along with three conditional rules (monotonicity, intersection and sub-concept rules). Applying SSIF to the October 3, 2018 release of GO suggested 1938 unique potentially missing <italic>is-a</italic> relations. Domain experts evaluated a random sample of 210 potentially missing <italic>is-a</italic> relations. The results showed SSIF achieved a precision of 60.61, 60.49 and 46.03% for the monotonicity, intersection and sub-concept rules, respectively.</p>

    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>The Gene Ontology (GO), recognized as a tool for the unification of biology (<xref rid="btaa106-B3" ref-type="bibr">Ashburner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), has been widely used for codifying, managing and sharing biological knowledge through the annotation of genes, gene products and sequences with semantic specificity for and across organisms. GO is considered the most comprehensive and extensively used knowledge-base relating to the functions of genes and their gene products (<xref rid="btaa106-B13" ref-type="bibr">Gene Ontology Consortium, 2018</xref>). It contains over 44 000 concepts covering three subdomains: biological process (the broad biological system in which a gene product is involved), molecular function (the specific role a gene product has or potentially has within a biological process) and cellular component (the location or organized unit in a cell where the gene product performs its molecular function) [<xref rid="btaa106-B10" ref-type="bibr">Francis (2013)</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneontology.org/page/documentation">http://www.geneontology.org/page/documentation</ext-link>], which are organized as three separate sub-ontologies.</p>
    <p>Relations between GO concepts include <italic>subtype (or is-a), part of, has part, regulates, negatively regulates</italic> and <italic>positively regulates</italic>. With regard to <italic>subtype</italic> relations, the three sub-ontologies of GO can be treated as separate directed acyclic graphs, with concepts as nodes and subtype relations as edges between concepts in the graphs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://geneontology.org/docs/ontology-relations/">http://geneontology.org/docs/ontology-relations/</ext-link>). The <italic>subtype</italic> relation forms the basic hierarchical structure of GO. For example, <italic>A is-a B</italic> means that node <italic>A</italic> is a subtype of node <italic>B</italic>. The subtype relation is transitive, i.e. if <italic>A is-a B</italic> and <italic>B is-a C</italic>, then <italic>A is-a C</italic> (<xref rid="btaa106-B8" ref-type="bibr">Dessimoz and Škunca, 2017</xref>).</p>
    <p>Biological knowledge captured in GO is continuously evolving. GO is updated and released monthly (<xref rid="btaa106-B12" ref-type="bibr">Gene Ontology Consortium, 2006</xref>). Such updates are an essential part of its lifecycle. In addition to keeping current with the latest biological discoveries, a major part of the updates aims to reflect efforts in improving its quality by fixing errors, inconsistencies and other potential quality issues.</p>
    <p>Because of its fundamental role in codifying, managing and sharing biological knowledge, quality issues in GO, if not addressed, can cause misleading results or missed biological discoveries (<xref rid="btaa106-B2" ref-type="bibr">Alterovitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Therefore, enhancing the quality of GO, though a challenging and arduous task, directly impacts the very foundation of data-intensive biological discovery.</p>
    <p>Various approaches for auditing and quality assurance have been applied to biomedical terminologies including GO (<xref rid="btaa106-B11" ref-type="bibr">Geller <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="btaa106-B26" ref-type="bibr">Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Most existing quality assurance approaches for GO have focused on the enrichment of concepts in order to keep pace with the rapidly evolving biological knowledge (<xref rid="btaa106-B9" ref-type="bibr">Dutkowski <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="btaa106-B16" ref-type="bibr">Maere <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="btaa106-B20" ref-type="bibr">Peng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="btaa106-B21" ref-type="bibr">Reimand <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Some works have focused on identifying inconsistencies in GO based on the lexical features of concepts, such as investigating inconsistent expression of concept terms in GO (<xref rid="btaa106-B23" ref-type="bibr">Verspoor <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) and studying the compositional structure of GO terms (<xref rid="btaa106-B19" ref-type="bibr">Ogren <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). A few studies have attempted to address quality issues of GO from a structural point of view, such as uncovering redundant relations, missing relations and erroneous relations. In one such work, <xref rid="btaa106-B18" ref-type="bibr">Ochs <italic>et al.</italic> (2016)</xref> developed two kinds of high-level summary graphs called abstraction networks for auditing GO and identified groups of anomalous terms that are expected to have a higher error rate when compared to other terms. <xref rid="btaa106-B17" ref-type="bibr">Mougin (2015)</xref> exploited reasoning over relationships in GO to identify redundant relations and leveraged compositional structure of the concept names to detect missing relations. <xref rid="btaa106-B24" ref-type="bibr">Xing <italic>et al.</italic> (2016)</xref> developed an algorithm combining dynamic programming and topological sort for exhaustive detection of redundant hierarchical relations in biomedical ontologies including GO. In a previous study, we employed a lexical-based inference approach to identify missing or erroneous hierarchical relations in GO (<xref rid="btaa106-B1" ref-type="bibr">Abeysinghe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p>
    <p>Although redundant relations may be acceptable, missing relations and erroneous relations reflect modeling issues of an ontology, and impact the quality of semantically-enabled applications, such as ontology-based search engines and ontology alignment systems (<xref rid="btaa106-B6" ref-type="bibr">Cui <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017a</xref>, <xref rid="btaa106-B7" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; <xref rid="btaa106-B15" ref-type="bibr">Lambrix <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Missing relations may lead to valid conclusions being missed, and erroneous relations may cause invalid conclusions. For instance, in the AmiGO web application for searching and browsing the GO database (<xref rid="btaa106-B5" ref-type="bibr">Carbon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), missing hierarchical relations directly influence the quality of the search results with valid results being missed. As an example, suppose we want to find all genes and gene products annotated to the GO concept <italic>cellular response to inorganic substance (GO: 0071241)</italic>; however, concept <italic>cellular response to oxygen radical (GO: 0071450)</italic> is currently not listed as its subtype (i.e. missing <italic>is-a</italic> relation). As a consequence, all the gene products which are annotated to concept <italic>cellular response to oxygen radical (GO: 0071450)</italic> would be missing from the search results.</p>
    <p>However, the main limitations of existing approaches for uncovering missing and erroneous relations in GO relations are: (i) the approach only identifies problematic areas where errors may exist and the results generated need extensive manual review by domain experts to uncover the exact quality issues (<xref rid="btaa106-B18" ref-type="bibr">Ochs <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), (ii) the approach only detects missing relations (<xref rid="btaa106-B17" ref-type="bibr">Mougin, 2015</xref>) or (iii) the approach only leverages simple lexical features neglecting sophisticated lexical features (<xref rid="btaa106-B1" ref-type="bibr">Abeysinghe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="btaa106-B17" ref-type="bibr">Mougin, 2015</xref>). In this article, we introduce a novel Subsumption-based Sub-term Inference Framework (SSIF) for uncovering not only missing relations but also erroneous relations in GO. SSIF will leverage a sequence-based term-algebra to analyze sophisticated lexical features of GO concepts and pinpoint the exact locations of quality issues.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec>
    <title>2 Materials and methods</title>
    <p>In this work, we use the October 3, 2018 release of GO in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) format. We first parse the OWL file to extract all the concepts and <italic>is-a</italic> relations in GO. Then, we compute the <italic>is-a</italic> transitive closure to get all the direct and indirect <italic>is-a</italic> relations.</p>
    <p>We develop SSIF by leveraging both the underlying hierarchical structure of GO and a novel term-algebra. SSIF contains three main components: (i) a sequence-based representation of GO concepts constructed using part-of-speech (POS) tagging, sub-concept matching and antonym tagging; (ii) a formulation of algebraic operations for the development of a term-algebra based on the sequence-based representation, that leverages subsumption-based longest subsequence alignment; and (iii) the construction of a set of conditional rules for backward subsumption inference aimed at uncovering problematic <italic>is-a</italic> relations in GO.</p>
    <sec>
      <title>2.1 Sequence-based representation of GO concepts</title>
      <p><xref rid="btaa106-B19" ref-type="bibr">Ogren <italic>et al.</italic> (2003)</xref> pointed out that over 65% of GO concepts (or terms) contain another GO term as a proper substring. For instance, <italic>negative regulation of cellular protein catabolic process (GO: 1903363)</italic> contains the term <italic>regulation of cellular protein catabolic process (GO: 1903362)</italic> as a proper substring. We refer to the proper substring as a sub-concept of the original concept. In addition, we consider those GO concepts containing only alphanumeric characters, constituting almost 90% of GO concepts.</p>
      <p>In this work, we represent each GO concept with a sequence of primitive elements, where a primitive element can be a single word or a sub-concept. Given an input concept <italic>C</italic>, we denote its sequence of elements <italic>E</italic>(<italic>C</italic>) as <inline-formula id="IE1"><mml:math id="IM1"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>…</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. We further annotate the elements with tags and form the corresponding sequence of tags <italic>T</italic>(<italic>C</italic>), denoted as <inline-formula id="IE2"><mml:math id="IM2"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>…</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where tag <italic>t<sub>i</sub></italic> corresponds to element <italic>e<sub>i</sub></italic>. The following three tagging processes are performed: POS tagging, sub-concept tagging and antonym tagging.</p>
      <sec>
        <title>2.1.1 POS tagging</title>
        <p>We leverage the Stanford Parser (<xref rid="btaa106-B22" ref-type="bibr">Toutanova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) to parse and annotate the GO terms to obtain sequence-based representations with tagged annotations for concepts. For example, the concept <inline-formula id="IE3"><mml:math id="IM3"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula><italic>negative regulation of cellular protein catabolic process (GO: 1903363)</italic> is represented and annotated as follows:

        <title>2.1.2 Sub-concept tagging</title>
        <p>After the POS tagging, we further detect sub-concepts contained in the concepts, i.e. the proper substrings of concepts that are also GO concepts. Then, we replace the substrings corresponding to the sub-concepts with their GO identifiers.

Note that, these sub-concepts are overlapping with each other (i.e. sharing at least one word in common), in which cases, we generate multiple representations for the input concept to handle the overlap. Therefore, the input concept <italic>C</italic> has four different representations (see <xref rid="btaa106-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) corresponding to the four sub-concepts detected.</p>

        <title>2.1.3 Antonym tagging</title>
        <p>To annotate concepts involving words with antonyms, we leverage a comprehensive collection of antonym pairs provided by WordNet (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/">https://wordnet.princeton.edu/</ext-link>), the most well-known lexical database for English. If there exists an element <italic>e<sub>i</sub></italic> of <italic>E</italic>(<italic>C</italic>) belonging to the antonym collection, then we annotate <italic>e<sub>i</sub></italic> with the <italic>ANT</italic> tag in addition to its original tag. For instance, for the concept <inline-formula id="IE14"><mml:math id="IM14"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula><italic>negative regulation of cellular protein catabolic process (GO: 1903363)</italic> (in <xref rid="btaa106-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), its first element <italic>negative</italic> involves the antonym pair (<italic>positive, negative</italic>), thus, we add the <italic>ANT</italic> tag for <italic>negative</italic> (as shown in <xref rid="btaa106-T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Note that, the <italic>ANT</italic> does not replace the original POS tag but rather serves as an additional tag for the element, indicating that the element <italic>negative</italic> is an adjective and has an antonym. We denote the antonym of element <italic>e<sub>i</sub></italic> as <inline-formula id="IE15"><mml:math id="IM15"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>¬</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p>

      <title>2.2 Algebraic operations</title>
      <p>The sequence-based representation of GO concepts enables alignment (or matching) between concepts. We introduce a Subsumption-based Longest Common Subsequence (SLCS) alignment approach to compare concepts. First, we define a subsumption relation between sequences of elements in GO, where an element can be a word or a GO concept. Given two sequences of elements <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic>, if the term corresponding to <italic>X</italic> is a GO concept and a subtype (direct or indirect) of the term corresponding to <italic>Y</italic>, we say that <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> have a subsumption relation, denoted as <inline-formula id="IE17"><mml:math id="IM17"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>≼</mml:mo><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>; otherwise, we say that <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> do not have a subsumption relation, denoted as <inline-formula id="IE18"><mml:math id="IM18"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋠</mml:mo><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. In particular, we assume <inline-formula id="IE19"><mml:math id="IM19"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>≼</mml:mo><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for any sequence of elements <italic>X</italic>.</p>
      <p>Next, we define the SLCS between two sequences of elements <inline-formula id="IE20"><mml:math id="IM20"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> [<inline-formula id="IE21"><mml:math id="IM21"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>…</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>] and <inline-formula id="IE22"><mml:math id="IM22"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> [<inline-formula id="IE23"><mml:math id="IM23"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>…</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>].

      <p>Hence, the SLCS between <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic>, <inline-formula id="IE29"><mml:math id="IM29"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">SLCS</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">SLCS</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. For instance, consider the two concepts <inline-formula id="IE30"><mml:math id="IM30"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula><italic>negative regulation by host of symbiont molecular function (GO:0052405)</italic> and <inline-formula id="IE31"><mml:math id="IM31"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula><italic>positive regulation by host of symbiont catalytic activity (GO:0043947)</italic>, as well as their sequence representations [<italic>negative, regulation, by, host, of, symbiont, GO:0003674</italic>] and [<italic>positive, regulation, by, host, of, symbiont, GO:0003824</italic>]. Since <italic>catalytic activity (GO:0003824)</italic> is a subtype of <italic>molecular function (GO:0003674)</italic>, we have <inline-formula id="IE32"><mml:math id="IM32"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">SLCS</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> [<italic>regulation, by, host, of, symbiont, GO:0003824</italic>].</p>
      <p>The SLCS between sequences of elements allows us to define an algebraic operation <italic>intersection</italic> (<inline-formula id="IE33"><mml:math id="IM33"><mml:mo>⊓</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>) as follows. Given two sequences of elements <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic>, there are two possible cases:</p>
      <list list-type="simple">

          <p>Case I: <inline-formula id="IE34"><mml:math id="IM34"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>≼</mml:mo><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>In this case, we define <inline-formula id="IE35"><mml:math id="IM35"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>⊓</mml:mo><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. That is to say, if the term corresponding to <italic>X</italic> is a subtype of (or more specific than) the term corresponding to <italic>Y</italic>, then <inline-formula id="IE36"><mml:math id="IM36"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>⊓</mml:mo><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is defined as the sequence of the more specific term.

      <title>2.4 Evaluation</title>
      <p>A random sample of potentially missing <italic>is-a</italic> relations is selected and evaluated by two domain experts (authors EWH and HNBM). The evaluation is performed independently by each domain expert and the disagreements between the two experts are resolved by discussion. For the monotonicity rule and intersection rule, domain experts are also provided with the existing <italic>is-a</italic> relations in GO that are leveraged to suggest the potentially missing <italic>is-a</italic> relations.</p>
      <p>The validity of each suggested missing <italic>is-a</italic> relation in the random sample is evaluated by the domain experts. If the suggested missing <italic>is-a</italic> relation is valid, then, it is indeed a missing <italic>is-a</italic> relation and considered as a true positive; if the suggested missing <italic>is-a</italic> relation is invalid due to existing erroneous relation(s), then the erroneous <italic>is-a</italic> relation(s) are identified as valid and considered as true positive(s); and all the other cases are considered as false positives. The precision of SSIF according to each rule can be calculated by dividing the number of true positives by the total number of true positives and false positives.</p>

      <title>3.1 Summary results</title>
      <p>For the October 3, 2018 release of GO, a total of 40 030 (out of 44 942) concepts were annotated with sequence-based representation. Among these, 30 086 concepts involve sub-concepts and 13 163 involve antonyms. The number of potentially missing <italic>is-a</italic> relations suggested by each conditional rule can be found in <xref rid="btaa106-T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. In total, three conditional rules suggested 1938 unique potentially missing <italic>is-a</italic> relations. The monotonicity and intersection rules leveraged 2436 existing <italic>is-a</italic> relations to make these suggestions. Note that certain potentially missing <italic>is-a</italic> relations can be obtained by multiple rules. For instance, 11 potentially missing <italic>is-a</italic> relations can be obtained by both the sub-concept rule and monotonicity rule; 228 can be obtained by the monotonicity rule and intersection rule; and 1 can be obtained by all the three conditional rules.</p>

      <p>Among the evaluation sample, two potentially missing <italic>is-a</italic> relations were obtained by both the sub-concept rule and monotonicity rule, and were indeed missing <italic>is-a</italic> relations validated by domain experts; 29 potentially missing <italic>is-a</italic> relations were obtained by both the monotonicity rule and intersection rule, and 13 of them were validated as missing <italic>is-a</italic> relations and 1 of them revealed an erroneous <italic>is-a</italic> relation; 1 potentially missing <italic>is-a</italic> relation was obtained by all the 3 rules and it was validated as a missing <italic>is-a</italic> relation. A majority of the valid problematic <italic>is-a</italic> relations identified by the monotonicity rule (54 out of 60) and intersection rule (44 out of 49) are missing <italic>is-a</italic> relations. In sum, 120 valid problematic <italic>is-a</italic> relations were verified by domain experts, including 110 missing <italic>is-a</italic> relations and 10 erroneous <italic>is-a</italic> relations.</p>

      <p>The valid problematic <italic>is-a</italic> relations indicate that the logical definitions of GO concepts could be further improved. For a valid missing <italic>is-a</italic> relation, it could be added to the logical definition of its corresponding sub-concept. For example, the relation <italic>positive regulation of actin filament annealing (GO</italic><italic>:0110056) is-a positive regulation of cytoskeleton organization (GO</italic><italic>:0051495)</italic> can be directly added to the logical definition of the sub-concept <italic>positive regulation of actin filament annealing (GO:0110056)</italic>. For a valid erroneous <italic>is-a</italic> relation, if the sub- and super-concepts have a direct <italic>is-a</italic> relation, then, the <italic>is-a</italic> relation can be directly removed from the logical definition of the sub-concept; if the sub- and super-concepts have an indirect <italic>is-a</italic> relation, then further investigation is needed to find out the root cause and make an appropriate correction.</p>

    <title>4 Discussion</title>
    <sec>
      <title>4.1 Evaluation metrics</title>
      <p>In this article, we focused on evaluating the performance of SSIF in terms of the <italic>precision</italic>, which was calculated by dividing the number of true positives by the total number of true positives and false positives in the evaluation sample. Note that, unlike traditional classification tasks, it is infeasible to measure actual <italic>recall</italic> due to the discovery nature of the quality assurance task, i.e. there is lack of reference standard (or ground truth) that contains false negatives for calculating the recall.</p>
      <p>However, one may use cumulative GO changes over different versions as a surrogate standard for evaluating <italic>retrospective recall</italic> as introduced in <xref rid="btaa106-B25" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> (2017)</xref>. For instance, we applied SSIF on the October 3, 2018 release of GO, which contained an erroneous <italic>is-a</italic> relation: <italic>glucose catabolic process to lactate via pyruvate (GO</italic><italic>:0019661) is-a pyridine nucleotide metabolic process (GO</italic><italic>:0019362)</italic>; this relation has been corrected and no longer exists in the current version. Such changes may serve as a partial reference standard to compute the retrospective recall.</p>
      <p>As an experiment, we compared the October 7, 2019 release and October 3, 2018 release of GO to create a partial reference standard. There were 1886 direct <italic>is-a</italic> relations, which were newly added in the October 7, 2019 release. Among these, 991 were due to the introduction of new concepts; 348 were already existent as indirect <italic>is-a</italic> relations in the October 3, 2018 release; and 107 involved concepts, which were not used in this work since they contained non-alphanumeric characters. Therefore, we consider the remaining 440 newly added relations in the October 7, 2019 release as the partial reference standard for missing <italic>is-a</italic> relations. Similarly, there were 3988 direct <italic>is-a</italic> relations, which were removed from the October 3, 2018 release. Among these, 3049 were due to concepts, which were either replaced or made obsolete; 370 were indirect <italic>is-a</italic> relations in the October 7, 2019 release; 71 involved concepts, which contained non-alphanumeric characters. Therefore, we consider the remaining 498 removed relations as the partial reference standard for erroneous <italic>is-a</italic> relations.</p>
      <p>Among the potentially missing <italic>is-a</italic> relations suggested by our SSIF, 46 were contained in the partial reference standard. Among the existing <italic>is-a</italic> relations, which were leveraged by SSIF to suggest potentially missing <italic>is-a</italic> relations, 27 were contained in the partial reference standard. As a result, SSIF achieved a retrospective recall of 7.78%, i.e. (46 + 27)/(440 + 498). In addition, 10 potentially missing <italic>is-a</italic> relations suggested by SSIF were indirect <italic>is-a</italic> relations in the October 7, 2019 release, indicating that they are also valid suggestions; and 42 indirect <italic>is-a</italic> relations in the October 3, 2018 release no longer exist in the October 7, 2019 release, indicating that they are erroneous <italic>is-a</italic> relations.</p>
      <p>The low value of the retrospective recall is expected since it is calculated purely based on a partial reference standard obtained through version differences. The actual recall should be higher than the retrospective recall, which can be seen from the fact that in the October 3, 2018 release of GO, only 6 out of 110 valid missing <italic>is-a</italic> relations verified by domain experts were reflected in the October 7, 2019 release, and only 2 out of 10 erroneous <italic>is-a</italic> relations were removed in the October 7, 2019 release. We will submit these verified suggestions to the GO Consortium for consideration of including them in future releases of GO.</p>

    <sec>
      <title>4.2 Distinction with OWL reasoners</title>
      <p>OWL reasoners, such as ELK (<xref rid="btaa106-B14" ref-type="bibr">Kazakov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) and Arachne (<xref rid="btaa106-B4" ref-type="bibr">Balhoff <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>), are used to check the consistency of GO, and to infer implicit knowledge from explicitly stated facts and axioms. The inference typically involves the reclassification of individuals to new classes (or concepts), and classes to new super-classes, depending on their stated relations. In other words, OWL reasoners infer additional <italic>is-a</italic> relations based on the stated <italic>is-a</italic> relations.</p>
      <p>Our SSIF approach is designed for the inferred version of GO where an OWL reasoner has already been applied to obtain additional <italic>is-a</italic> relations. SSIF aims at identifying problematic <italic>is-a</italic> relations that even OWL reasoners have missed. Therefore, SSIF complements OWL reasoners to enhance the completeness and soundness of the ontology by identifying potentially missing and erroneous <italic>is-a</italic> relations.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>4.3 Analysis of false positives</title>
      <p>Although SSIF was capable of uncovering problematic <italic>is-a</italic> relations in GO, it cannot completely avoid false positives. In other words, there are invalid suggestions made by SSIF. For example, the sub-concept rule suggested <italic>nuclear membrane mitotic spindle pole body tethering complex (GO:0106084)</italic> is a subtype of <italic>tethering complex (GO:0099023)</italic>. However, this relation is invalid, since <italic>tethering complex</italic> is defined as a complex that plays a role in vesicle tethering, while <italic>nuclear membrane mitotic spindle pole body tethering complex</italic> is tethering non-vesicle cellular components. Note that, <italic>tethering complex</italic> has been renamed as <italic>vesicle tethering complex</italic> in the current release of GO, in which case SSIF will not make the invalid suggestion of <italic>GO</italic><italic>:0106084 is-a GO</italic><italic>:0099023</italic>.</p>
      <p>The monotonicity rule suggested <italic>negative regulation of renal output by angiotensin (GO</italic><italic>:0003083) is-a negative regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure (GO</italic><italic>:0003085)</italic>. This is an invalid <italic>is-a</italic> relation, because <italic>negative regulation of renal output by angiotensin (GO:0003083)</italic> is actually a subtype of <italic>positive regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure (GO:0003084)</italic>. Although this invalid <italic>is-a</italic> relation was obtained by an existing <italic>is-a</italic> relation: <italic>regulation of renal output by angiotensin (GO:0002019)</italic> is a subtype of <italic>regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure (GO:0003073)</italic>, the latter relation is valid as the two concepts do not specify a qualifier of positive or negative.</p>
      <p>The intersection rule suggested <italic>peptide cross-linking via an oxazole or thiazole (GO</italic><italic>:0018157) is-a cellular macromolecule biosynthetic process (GO</italic><italic>:0034645)</italic>. This potentially missing <italic>is-a</italic> relation was obtained by two existing <italic>is-a</italic> relations: <italic>peptide cross-linking via an oxazole or thiazole (GO</italic><italic>:0018157) is-a cellular macromolecule metabolic process (GO</italic><italic>:0044260)</italic> and <italic>peptide cross-linking via an oxazole or thiazole (GO</italic><italic>:0018157) is-a cellular biosynthetic process (GO</italic><italic>:0044249)</italic>. Since biosynthesis is for the oxazole or thiazole, but not for the macromolecule (which is simply being modified), the former relation is invalid while the latter two existing relations are valid. A complete list of false positives can be found in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> ‘FalsePositives.xlsx’.</p>
      <p>As can be seen from <xref rid="btaa106-T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, the precision of SSIF according to the sub-concept rule is lower than that of the monotonicity rule and intersection rule. Through manual review of the false positives obtained by the sub-concept rule, we found that there were 11 of the suggested potentially missing <italic>is-a</italic> relations, which already have a <italic>part-of</italic> relation in GO. For instance, the sub-concept suggested <italic>basal plasma membrane (GO</italic><italic>:0009925) is-a plasma membrane (GO</italic><italic>:0005886)</italic>, however, the two concepts already have a <italic>part-of</italic> relation.</p>

    <sec>
      <title>4.4 Limitations and future work</title>
      <p>A limitation of this work is that we only focused on suggesting problematic <italic>is-a</italic> relations in GO. As mentioned earlier, the sub-concept rule suggested some invalid <italic>is-a</italic> relations, which already have a <italic>part-of</italic> relation. We plan to further investigate other types of problematic relations in GO including <italic>part-of</italic>. Regarding the identification of erroneous <italic>is-a</italic> relations in terms of the monotonicity rule and intersection rule, although SSIF requires significantly less manual effort from domain experts than most other ontology auditing approaches (by providing rationales for the suggestions of problematic <italic>is-a</italic> relations), domain experts still need to review the provided existing <italic>is-a</italic> relations that were leveraged to make the suggestion and determine if there is any erroneous relation(s) can be identified or the original suggestion is a false positive. It would be desirable to develop an automated approach that can directly detect erroneous <italic>is-a</italic> relations to further reduce domain experts’ manual review effort.</p>
    </sec>

  <sec>
    <title>5 Conclusion</title>
    <p>In this article, we introduced SSIF to identify problematic <italic>is-a</italic> relations in GO. SSIF models GO concepts in a sequence-based representation, formulates a term-algebra and leverages three conditional rules to perform backward subsumption inference, in order to automatically suggest potentially missing <italic>is-a</italic> relations, which may further reveal erroneous <italic>is-a</italic> relations. SSIF achieved a precision of 60.61% according to the monotonicity rule, 60.49% according to the intersection rule and 46.03% according to the sub-concept rule. Since SSIF leverages the hierarchical structure and the features of concept names, which are inherent and fundamental to biomedical terminologies, it is generally applicable to audit other biomedical terminologies.</p>
