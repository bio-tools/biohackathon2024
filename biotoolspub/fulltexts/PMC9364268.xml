      <p>Peptide-based cancer vaccines have been shown to boost immune systems to kill tumor cells in cancer patients. However, designing an effective T cell epitope peptide-based cancer vaccine still remains a challenge and is a major hurdle for the application of cancer vaccines. In this study, we constructed for the first time a library of peptide-based cancer vaccines and their clinical attributes, named CancerVaccine (<uri xlink:href="https://peptidecancervaccine.weebly.com/">https://peptidecancervaccine.weebly.com/</uri>). To investigate the association factors that influence the effectiveness of cancer vaccines, these peptide-based cancer vaccines were classified into high (HCR) and low (LCR) clinical responses based on their clinical efficacy. Our study highlights that modified peptides derived from artificially modified proteins are suitable as cancer vaccines, especially for melanoma. It may be possible to advance cancer vaccines by screening for HLA class II affinity peptides may be an effective therapeutic strategy. In addition, the treatment regimen has the potential to influence the clinical response of a cancer vaccine, and Montanide ISA-51 might be an effective adjuvant. Finally, we constructed a high sensitivity and specificity machine learning model to assist in designing peptide-based cancer vaccines capable of providing high clinical responses. Together, our findings illustrate that a high clinical response following peptide-based cancer vaccination is correlated with the right type of peptide, the appropriate adjuvant, and a matched HLA allele, as well as an appropriate treatment regimen. This study would allow for enhanced development of cancer vaccines.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Cancer is a heterogeneous disease with mixed clinical outcomes (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Conventional cancer treatments tend to non-specifically kill tumor cells. Some of these tumor cells survive due to resistance to therapy and drug toxicity, eventually leading to tumor relapse and metastasis (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Cancer immunotherapy is a treatment strategy that uses a patient’s own immune system to fight the cancerous cells (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Immunotherapy has become a promising alternative cancer treatment after surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy in recent years because of its mild side effects and significant therapeutic benefits (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). T cell epitope peptide-based cancer vaccine is one of the representative strategies of cancer immunotherapy, relying on short peptide fragments to engineer the induction of highly targeted immune responses (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p>
    <p>Previous studies (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) have demonstrated the effectiveness of peptide-based cancer vaccines in treating several common types of cancer, such as breast cancer, melanoma, colorectal and lung cancer. This strategy exploits the fact that the surfaces of cancer cells have various peptide epitopes (i.e., peptides of usually 8-17 residues in length), which bind to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. T cells can attack these cancer cells after recognizing the peptide/MHC complex (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). T cells aimed to induce immune recognition of tumor cells are then able to eradicate them by generating a sustained and potent anti-tumor immune response. Therefore, a key determinant for an anti-tumor immune response to lead to the effective killing of cancer cells is the selection of immunogenic peptide epitopes as the target (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Many peptide epitopes have been identified and molecularly characterized in experiments (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). While there are many options in selecting immunogenic antigens, it is not clear which selected epitopes can induce the dominant immune system mediated by T cells. Many clinical studies in cancer vaccines have been initiated to assess the therapeutic potential of active immunization or vaccination with peptide epitopes in cancer patients. However, it is still unclear what the ideal characteristics of selected peptide epitopes should be and which could induce stronger anti-tumor responses. Therefore, it remains highly challenging to design an effective cancer vaccine that can achieve a meaningful clinical benefit in patients.</p>
    <p>There have been many breakthroughs in prior studies that investigated the optimal conditions for designing a peptide-based cancer vaccine (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Thomas et al, Zhang et al, and Liu et al found differences in the therapeutic efficacy of peptide-based cancer vaccines prepared from different sources of peptides (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Furthermore, patients with certain HLA alleles might be more sensitive to respond to cancer vaccines (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The same cancer vaccine with different adjuvants might also have an impact on the outcome of treatment (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). In addition, different treatment strategies could also affect the efficacy and side effects of cancer vaccines, such as the dose of vaccine used, injection interval, number of injections, and injection methods (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). However, due to the limited number of clinical trials available, combined with the difference in cancer types and patient conditions, it is difficult to improve a cancer vaccine design by directly referring to the design of other cancer vaccines. Machine learning (ML) options such as Random forest (RF) (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>)could improve cancer vaccine design by utilizing large data repositories to identify novel features and more complex interactions among these features.</p>
    <p>In this study, a library of peptide-based cancer vaccines used in clinical studies from public and private sources was established from multiple sources, such as PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Web of Science, using databases up to January 1, 2022. The statistical analysis of types of peptides, adjuvants, treatment regimen, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles of peptides, and other features in vaccine therapy was obtained from the results in high clinical response (HCR) and low clinical response (LCR) in the database to find the associations which influence the treatment effect of cancer immunotherapy. Finally, we built a random forest model to help distinguish which kinds of cancer vaccines in patients are most likely to achieve a high clinical response.</p>

      <title>Data utilized in this study screening and extraction</title>
      <p>We screen and extracted all the peptide-based cancer vaccine relevant studies, retrieved from the PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Web of Science, using databases up to January 1, 2022. All studies were browsed, searched, prioritized, and filtered by the investigators based on the keywords: peptide*, vaccine*, cancer/tumor*, human, HLA, clinical. These extracted studies were then reviewed according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. In cases in which the results obtained were different, the case was discussed further to obtain consensus. Further details are provided in the following sections. Finally, A total of 705 peptides resulting from 152 clinical studies containing peptide-based cancer vaccine features and clinical treatment information were registered in our library, which has been posted to our web-accessible library, CancerVaccine (<uri xlink:href="https://peptidecancervaccine.weebly.com/">https://peptidecancervaccine.weebly.com/</uri>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s2_2">
      <title>Inclusion criteria</title>
      <p>The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1. The study focused on human cancer research. 2. The study used the peptide as the vaccine to treat cancer patients. 3. They are not review reports; there are cancer detail descriptions and treatment information about the clinical trials.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s2_3">
      <title>Exclusion criteria</title>
      <p>The exclusion criteria were as follows: 1. The peptide-based cancer vaccine was not associated with humans. 2. There was no associated peptide information. 3. There was no treatment information for the peptide-based cancer vaccine.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s2_4">
      <title>Feature selection procedure</title>
      <p>Exploratory data analysis: First, we checked the types of variables. There were no missing values in the data (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Figure S3A</bold></xref>). Next, we created a bar graph for the categorical variables; if the levels of all categorical variables looked correct, we kept the original levels for these variables (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Figure S3B</bold></xref>). Finally, four features were recommended for the model: injection interval and injection time, adjuvants, and HLA alleles; the blue dot represents the optimal solution, as shown in <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Figure S3C</bold></xref>.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s2_5">
      <title>Classifier</title>
      <p>We use a random forest model (random Forest package in R) (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) to construct a feature-based classifier. The prediction performance (estimated by 10-fold cross-validation) is best when the top 4 features with the most differentiation are included (injection interval, injection times, adjuvant types, and HLA alleles), indicating that these 4 features have the greatest differentiation power. Using these 4 features as predictors, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was 0.97. The ROC curves were plotted using the pROC R package.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s2_6">
      <title>The area under the precision-recall curve</title>
      <p>For computing the AUPRC, we used the function metrics.precision_recall_curve and metrics.auc from the R package, ROCR 1.0-11 version (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). We first randomly divided the library cohort with known high or low clinical response into a training set (50% randomly selected samples) and a test set (50% randomly selected samples) based on cancer type. Then, the merged training set was used as the training set and the merged test set was used as the test set. Finally, we logit-transformed AUPRC values before testing (using two-tailed Welch’s t-test). We carried out 1,000 replications of 5-fold cross-validation; within each replication, across the 5-folds, we obtained prediction scores for each cancer type from the fold in which the cancer type was in the test set, enabling us to compute an overall AUPRC within each replication.</p>

    <sec id="s2_7">
      <title>Statistical analysis</title>
      <p>The R statistical package was used for all data processing and statistical analysis (R package: stats v3.6.2). All details of the statistical tests are specified in the associated text or figure legends. For the statistical analyses, P-values were calculated by using the “Wilcox_test” function from the R package: stats v3.6.2, which applies the two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test and corrected multiple testing using the Holm–Bonferroni method. A statistically significant difference was assumed when P ≤ 0.05.</p>

      <title>Data filtering and features of selected trials</title>
      <p>To investigate what classes of peptide-based cancer vaccine can help achieve satisfactory results from clinical treatment, we reviewed a total of 302 relevant studies, retrieved from the PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Web of Science, using databases up to January 1, 2022. PubMed.gov is a free search engine that accesses the MEDLINE database on life sciences and biomedical topics primarily at the U.S. National Institutes of Health’s National Library of Medicine. The database of ClinicalTrials.gov is a service of the U.S. National Institute of Health. After removing duplicates, we screened 206 potentially relevant articles by scanning the titles and abstracts. We reviewed the full text and screened the candidate studies according to the inclusion criteria, and 43 studies were excluded. Of the remaining 163 studies, 11 were excluded due to describing the same repeated clinical trials. A total of 705 peptides resulting from 152 clinical studies containing peptide-based cancer vaccine features and clinical treatment information were registered in our library (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>–<xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>). Details of the study identification process can be found in <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>. The final study population included 6,713 participants. All studies were retrospective studies published between January 1, 1997 and January 1, 2022, and involved various tumor types. The details of the library in this study have been posted to our web-accessible library, CancerVaccine (<uri xlink:href="https://peptidecancervaccine.weebly.com/">https://peptidecancervaccine.weebly.com/</uri>).</p>

      <p>In order to analyze this library in a comprehensive and in-depth manner, we mapped the types of cancer and peptide, adjuvant, HLA allele, and treatment regimen (injection interval and injection times) landscapes of the library, as shown in <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figures 1B-G</bold></xref>, respectively. We found that melanoma, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer are the most common cancer types investigated in cancer vaccine therapy (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>). The peptides were divided into five categories based on the origin of peptides: tumor expressed peptides, tumor overexpressed peptides, fusion peptides, modified peptides, and single-nucleotide variant (SNV) peptides. For tumor expressed peptides, the genes in which the peptides were co-expressed are found in both cancer and normal tissues (<xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>, <xref rid="B164" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>–<xref rid="B166" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>). For tumor overexpressed peptides, the genes in which the peptides were located are found overexpressed in the tumor tissue only (<xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>, <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>, <xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>). For fusion peptides, the peptides were derived from gene fusion (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>, <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>, <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>, <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>). For modified peptides, the amino acids (AA) had been artificially modified (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>, <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>, <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>, <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>, <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>, <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>, <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>, <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>, <xref rid="B169" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>–<xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>). The SNV derived peptides were neoantigen, or a new AA sequence that forms on cancer cells when somatic mutations occur in tumor DNA sequences (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>, <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>, <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>, <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>, <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>, <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>, <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>, <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>, <xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>, <xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>, <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>, <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>, <xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>, <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>, <xref rid="B165" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>).</p>
      <p>We found that more than half the peptides (51.4%) used in cancer vaccine preparation were overexpressed in the targeted tumor cells (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1C</bold></xref>). We also found that Montanide ISA-51 was the most widely used adjuvant in cancer vaccines. IL-2 was the most widely used cytokine as a vaccine adjuvant in cancer vaccines (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1D</bold></xref>). Interestingly, most clinical phase peptides are focused on the HLA class I alleles, especially the A02 and A24, as shown in <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1E</bold></xref>. In addition, we noted that more than half of peptide-based cancer vaccines were injected weekly (53.9%, <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1F</bold></xref>) and more than half of the patients had greater than four vaccine injections (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1G</bold></xref>).</p>

      <title>The prognostic evaluation of anti-tumor effect in clinical trials</title>
      <p>After building this library, we wanted to further explore the causes which influence the effectiveness of peptide-based cancer vaccine results. We divided these peptide-based cancer vaccine results into high clinical response (HCR) and low clinical response (LCR) results based on their clinical efficacy and safety (<xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>).</p>
      <p>The specific classification criteria and basis of a high clinical response were presented in the form of an evolutionary tree, as shown in <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>. The prerequisite criteria was whether there have been any vaccine-related deaths; if there were vaccine-related deaths, it was excluded from this study. A total of 78 peptides which involved 673 patients were excluded from this study. We next examined whether patients in the best objective response (complete or partial response, according to modified World Health Organization criteria) had been reported (<xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>–<xref rid="B174" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>). Due to the complex tumor microenvironment and vaccine technology limitations, it is difficult to achieve a complete response with vaccine therapy; therefore, the best objective response indicates that the clinical response of the vaccine therapy is high (<xref rid="B175" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>). We also looked at cases where there were no best objective response patients, investigating whether more than 50% of patients achieved stable disease (SD) or progression-free survival (PFS) if the previous conditions were not met. If more than half of the patients achieved SD or PFS, we took this as an indication that the cancer vaccine was effective (<xref rid="B174" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>, <xref rid="B176" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>). Finally, we compared whether the overall survival time was significantly longer in the vaccine group than in the control group; a significantly longer overall survival time in the vaccine group could also indicate that the vaccine worked well (<xref rid="B177" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>, <xref rid="B178" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>). If none of these progressive conditions were met, then the clinical result was classified as a low clinical response result. The clinical efficacy evaluation was performed using the immune-related response criteria (irRC) (<xref rid="B179" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>) and response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST 1.1) standard criteria (<xref rid="B180" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>).

      <title>Modified and tumor overexpressed peptides could be suitably selected for cancer vaccines</title>
      <p>Cancer vaccines face a number of challenges, including finding suitable sources of peptides that work best <italic>in vivo</italic>. The peptides were divided into five categories based on the origin of peptides (<xref rid="B182" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>, <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>): the tumor expressed peptides, tumor overexpressed peptides, fusion peptides, modified peptides, and single-nucleotide variant (SNV) peptides. We summarized their distribution in the results from high and low clinical responses (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). As shown in <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>, most of the peptides in the library are expressed or overexpressed in cancer. The overexpressed peptides achieved many of the high clinical response results (41.3%), especially in colorectal cancer (59.6% <italic>vs</italic>. 40.4% in high <italic>vs</italic>. low clinical response results, <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figures 3A</bold></xref>, <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig"><bold>C</bold></xref>). The fusion cancer vaccines were not as efficacious in clinical trials, as they did not lead to any high clinical responses (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>). However, modified peptides, in which the amino acids (AA) were artificially modified, appeared to be the most suitable method for cancer vaccine (69.6% of modified peptides achieved high clinical response results), especially for melanoma immunotherapy (84.2%, <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figures 3B</bold></xref>, <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig"><bold>C</bold></xref>).

      <title>HLA class II peptide-based cancer vaccines could achieve high clinical response results</title>
      <p>The cytotoxic T cell (CTL) epitope peptides were restricted with HLA alleles when they were prepared as cancer vaccines (<xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>, <xref rid="B184" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>–<xref rid="B186" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>). Previous studies have reported that an accurate HLA allele is a key factor in successful cancer vaccinations (<xref rid="B186" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>, <xref rid="B187" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>). More than 90% of cancer vaccines in our library are typed for HLA Class I alleles (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>), with the most common being HLA- A02, A24, A3sup, A26, and A01. This is generally consistent with the proportional rank of these alleles in the population (<xref rid="B188" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>, <xref rid="B189" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>). We noticed that patients with melanoma achieved more high clinical response results when using peptides typed for HLA-A01 and HLA Class II. For example, all peptides with HLA-A01 alleles achieved high clinical response results in melanoma (13 <italic>vs</italic>. 0, <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figures 4B</bold></xref>, <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig"><bold>C</bold></xref>), although this is limited by the sample size and we may need more data to verify whether a similar trend exists in other cancer types (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Figure S4</bold></xref>). The peptides with HLA Class II alleles also achieved more high clinical response results (28 <italic>vs</italic>. 15, P = 0.0049, <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figures 4A</bold></xref>, <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig"><bold>B</bold></xref>), especially for melanoma and lung cancer patients (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref>). HLA Class II alleles are highly associated with the CD4+ T cells; CD4+ T cells primarily mediate anti-tumor immunity by providing help for CD8+ CTL and antibody responses, as well as <italic>via</italic> secretion of effector cytokines such as interferon-γ (IFNγ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα).

      <p>We found that Montanide ISA-51 and Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were the two most widely used adjuvants in cancer vaccines (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5A</bold></xref>), and they also appeared most frequently in high clinical response results (P = 6.83e-19 and 0.045, respectively, <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figures 5A</bold></xref>, <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig"><bold>B</bold></xref>).

      <title>Generation of a random forest model from clinical responses for cancer vaccines</title>
      <p>Given that some redundant or irrelevant features in the new data set may exert an influence on the classifying effects of a machine learning model, the importance value of cancer vaccine features was first calculated by means of a Random Forest algorithm, followed by the selection of the optimal features based on each feature’s importance (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 7A</bold></xref> and <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Supplemental Figure S3</bold></xref>).

Four features were chosen for the random forest-based modeling in this study: injection interval, injection times, adjuvant types, and HLA alleles (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 7A</bold></xref>).</p>

      <p>For the random forest-based modeling, the library cohort with known high or low clinical response was randomly split into a training set (50% randomly selected samples) and a test set (50% randomly selected samples) according to the cancer types. The merged training set was used as the training set and the merged test set as the test set. The model was trained on the training set and tested on the test set, with 1,000 repeated nested 5-fold cross-validation. The model achieved a high area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 sensitivity on the test set (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 7B</bold></xref>, black curve). The prediction model’s performance was first assessed in four independent cancer type cohorts (breast cancer, melanoma, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer) with the equilibrium of class distribution and balanced data. Our model also achieved AUCs of 0.87, 0.99, 0.99, and 0.98 for independent breast cancer, melanoma, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer datasets, respectively, demonstrating that our model could predict their vaccine responses from the features we selected (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 7B</bold></xref>). In addition, the prediction model was also evaluated from the perspectives of the average precision score and precision-recall (AUPRC) (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Figure S3D</bold></xref>).</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>Immunotherapies such as peptide-based cancer vaccines have proven to be effective in enhancing the immune response in cancer patients to fight cancer cells. Cancer vaccines that specifically target high expression of gp100 in melanoma have already been approved (<xref rid="B199" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>). However, one of the key factors limiting the application of immunotherapy is how to rationally design a peptide-based cancer vaccine that generates an anti-tumor immune response leading to the effective killing of tumor cells (<xref rid="B200" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>–<xref rid="B202" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>). The goal of our study is to determine the key criteria for cancer vaccines that may lead to better clinical outcomes.</p>
    <p>We collected T cell epitopes from several databases that had been applied to clinical studies to construct <italic>in silico</italic> a library of peptide-based cancer vaccines. These candidate T cell epitopes could activate CD8+ or CD4+ T cells to induce cytotoxicity for tumor cells. The selected peptide epitopes could be used as cancer vaccines or as target antigens for adoptive cell therapy of DC, CTL, TCR-T, and CAR-T cells. To find the associations which influence treatment effectiveness of cancer vaccines, several critical factors, including types of peptides, HLA alleles, adjuvants, and treatment regimens, were analyzed in patients with high and low clinical responses.</p>
    <p>We found that studies often chose tumor expressed or overexpressed peptides to prepare cancer vaccines (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figures 1</bold></xref>, <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig"><bold>3</bold></xref>). However, modified peptides in which the amino acids (AAs) always were artificially modified, could be more suitable for cancer vaccines, especially for melanoma immunotherapy (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>, <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>, <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>, <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>, <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>) (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). The reason modified peptides are more effective may be because the AAs of modified peptides are altered and these modified peptides will be treated as exogenous peptides, which are more easily recognized by T cells and therefore more immunogenic (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B203" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>–<xref rid="B205" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>). Alternatively, the genes of these modified peptides are always expressed or overexpressed in tumor cells (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Figure S1</bold></xref>), and their comparative wild-type peptides are usually known to have binding affinities for certain HLA alleles (<xref rid="B206" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>–<xref rid="B208" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>). Based on this information, we could make targeted modifications to the modified peptides, further enhancing the affinity of modified peptides for pMHC, potentially making modified peptides more immunogenic and therapeutically effective. However, it is possible that modified peptides are also expressed in normal cells, which could lead to uncertain side effects (<xref rid="B205" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>, <xref rid="B208" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>).</p>
    <p>Based on our study, Montanide ISA-51, in particular, was the most frequently used adjuvant with high clinical response results (59.4%, P = 1.3e-17, <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>), especially in breast cancer and colorectal cancer (92.1% and 95.6%, respectively, as shown in <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5A, C</bold></xref>). Montanide ISA-51 can enhance antigen-specific antibody titers and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses. Doorn et al. reported that a proper mixture of peptide epitopes and Montanide ISA-51 could help effectively avoid or mitigate adverse events (<xref rid="B209" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>, <xref rid="B210" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>). Because cytokine modulation is necessary for efficacious treatment of experimental neuropathic pain (<xref rid="B196" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>). Many cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-4, and IL-12, were widely used cytokines as vaccine adjuvants. IL-2 in particular was used as an immune adjuvant in many cancer types, such as lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and melanoma. However, as vaccination adjuvants, these cytokines are less efficient than Montanide ISA-51 or GM-CSF (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>). There are several possible explanations for this. One explanation is that cytokines are susceptible to degradation due to their short half-life (<xref rid="B211" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>, <xref rid="B212" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>). Another explanation could be that the main role of adjuvants is to activate the immune system and activate effector T cells (<xref rid="B194" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>). If we use IL-2, IL-4, and IL-12 as the adjuvant in cancer vaccine therapy, we need them to activate effector T cells. However, IL-2 has a higher affinity and stimulatory effect on regulatory T cells (Tregs). Therefore, IL-2 will activate Treg cells along with effector T cells. Tregs are a specialized subpopulation of T cells that act to suppress the immune response. Thus, it is difficult to achieve a high clinical response with IL-2 alone. IL-4 is a cytokine that induces the differentiation of naive helper T cells (Th0 cells) to Th2 cells, thereby inducing immunosuppression (<xref rid="B213" ref-type="bibr">213</xref>). Therefore, IL-4 generally does not have a good antitumor effect in cancer vaccines as an adjuvant alone. IL-12 is an interleukin that is naturally produced by dendritic cells (<xref rid="B214" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>). It has a strong anti-tumor therapeutic effect, but IL-12 is difficult to use in molecular therapy alone (<xref rid="B215" ref-type="bibr">215</xref>). Thus, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-12 are not very effective when used alone in peptide-based cancer vaccines. Antigen-specific specificity is important in cancer vaccinations. However, antigen-specific cytokines do not exist; cytokines can activate many non-specific or tumor growth promoting pathways, which is ineffective and unhelpful for the specificity of a cancer vaccine (<xref rid="B216" ref-type="bibr">216</xref>, <xref rid="B217" ref-type="bibr">217</xref>). IL-2, IL-4, and IL-12 may need to be modified or combined with other adjuvants, such as Montanide ISA-51 or GM-CSF in peptide-based cancer vaccine therapies to increase effectiveness.</p>
    <p>In addition to these cancer vaccines that utilized various adjuvants, we also observed that many cases did not use any adjuvants in cancer vaccine preparation, which could be a factor leading to the poor clinical outcomes of many peptide vaccinations in clinical trials (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>, <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>, <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>, <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>, <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>, <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>, <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>, <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>, <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>, <xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>, <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>, <xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>, <xref rid="B218" ref-type="bibr">218</xref>–<xref rid="B221" ref-type="bibr">221</xref>)</p>
    <p>The treatment regimen also plays an important role in the therapeutic efficacy of cancer vaccines. The treatment regimens with weekly injection intervals and greater than four vaccination injections were more likely to achieve a high clinical response (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref>). Short vaccine injection intervals and multiple vaccinations could continually activate the immune system, ensuring that there are enough cytotoxic T cells to kill tumor cells, enhancing the tumor-killing effect and making it easier to get a high clinical response (<xref rid="B222" ref-type="bibr">222</xref>). However, many of the available treatment regimens did not use shorter vaccine intervals and more frequent injections. This could be because many of the patients who participated in the cancer vaccine clinical trials had gone through various conventional treatments, and many of them also had stage III or stage IV tumors. As a result, they were already in a weakened condition. Shortened vaccination intervals and an increased frequency could lead to stronger side effects that would be difficult for these weaker patients to tolerate. Therefore, shorter intervals and more frequent injections may be more appropriate for patients with early-stage tumors, while relatively frail patients could have longer injection intervals, but no less than four injections are recommended.</p>
    <p>Finally, we investigated the correlation between multiple features, such as the peptide types, adjuvant, HLA alleles, and treatment regimens, in cancer vaccines, and we built a random forest model to distinguish the peptide-based cancer vaccines with high clinical responses (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figures 7</bold></xref>, <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>S3</bold></xref>). In addition, we also investigated the effect of the tumor stages and chemotherapy, which could reflect the patient’s health condition and medical treatment prior to vaccination on the model prediction. We summarized their distribution in the results from the high and low clinical responses (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Figures S4A</bold></xref>, <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>B</bold></xref>). The relative importance of the tumor stages and chemotherapy are weaker than the peptide types, adjuvant, HLA alleles, and treatment regimens in this study (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Figure S4C</bold></xref>). The prediction accuracy of our model was also not improved by introducing them (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Figure S4D</bold></xref>). Possible causes for this are that many clinical trials included patients with different tumor stages, and some others omitted patients’ tumor stages information. There is no significant difference between the chemotherapy group and the no or unknown chemotherapy group (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Figure S4B</bold></xref>). The cause could be that many of the cancer vaccine trials included patients who had undergone conventional medical treatments, which included but are not limited to chemotherapy. Moreover, some clinical trials excluded patients who had received chemotherapy (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) or required patients to wait a period of time after chemotherapy before participating in cancer vaccine therapy to eliminate and minimize the impact of chemotherapy on vaccine therapy (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>, <xref rid="B220" ref-type="bibr">220</xref>). Therefore, we think that the tumor stage and chemotherapy may have less impact on the improvement of prediction accuracy (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Figure S4D</bold></xref>).</p>
    <p>We found a combination of the modified peptides, Montanide ISA-51, a short interval between vaccine injections, and multiple vaccinations could be helpful in effectively activating the immune system to kill tumors, enhancing the tumor-killing effect, and resulting in high clinical responses.</p>
    <p>The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is prone to specific mutations that alter viral surface peptide epitopes, making the virus more susceptible to immune escape (<xref rid="B223" ref-type="bibr">223</xref>). Peptide-based tumor vaccine research has also contributed to the development of COVID-19 vaccines targeting COVID-19-specific peptide epitopes (<xref rid="B224" ref-type="bibr">224</xref>, <xref rid="B225" ref-type="bibr">225</xref>).</p>
    <p>There are several limitations noted in this study. First, there are no prior studies that quantitatively distinguish between high or low results in cancer vaccine clinical trials; it is possible that we missed information in classifying a high or low response result. Next, due to lack of sufficient data for a single tumor type, we could not directly explore the difference in each cancer type between the high- and low- clinical response groups.</p>
    <p>In addition, the effect of the tumor mutation burden, the dose of the cancer vaccine, and the specific method of injection, such as subcutaneous, intranasal, intravenous, and transdermal, may also need to be further explored in the future studies. Lastly, the effect of coupling multiple features on cancer vaccine efficacy is complex and was not investigated in depth in this study. Thus, future studies can explore further the effects of coupling multiple features on cancer vaccine efficacy based on a larger cohort.</p>
    <p>Altogether, we presented CancerVaccine, a peptide-based cancer vaccine library that stored and aggregated the results of peptide-based cancer vaccines and their clinical attributes. CancerVaccine can be accessed at <uri xlink:href="https://peptidecancervaccine.weebly.com/">https://peptidecancervaccine.weebly.com/</uri>. We demonstrated that CancerVaccine is a versatile resource that can be used to screen for useful peptides epitopes and aid in the design of new cancer vaccines. Our study describes a design strategy in peptide vaccination treatment relating to the appropriate types of peptides, suitable adjuvants, matched HLA alleles, and suitable treatment regimens. Furthermore, we developed a high AUC machine learning model, which could be helpful in identifying peptide-based cancer vaccines with high clinical responses. The results of this study could impact future exploration of vaccine designs, taking into consideration identifying suitable peptide antigens and treatment conditions for cancer and personalized immunotherapy.</p>
